<ul><a name="07010949000241"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What discussions they have held during 2006 with the International Atomic Energy Authority concerning the proposal for a new international nuclear fuel bank.</p>

The UK has played an active role in these discussions. At an IAEA special event in September, we introduced a proposal for an enrichment bond, which has been widely recognised as bold and practical. UK officials recently met members of the IAEA Secretariat to discuss this proposal.</p>

However, it is serious, given the wide expectation that there will be a renaissance of civil nuclear generation across the world, given that most countries do not have direct access to uranium-enrichment facilities, and given the enthusiastic support of the IAEA for the whole concept and, I might add, the support of our own Prime Minister in a speech in Georgetown on 26 May last year. Why, then, when one reads the international press on this issue, does it seem that the Americans and the Russians are making all the running? Why are the Government not pushing their own view on this and making it public? In short, why are the Government so reluctant to come to come forward with their own proposals in public? I have seen the paper in the Library, but why can we not hear more about it?</p>

In relation to the UK&#146;s support for these very important proposals, as the noble Lord said, the Prime Minister endorsed them in his speech in May. We have been rather strong advocates of the approach and have made our views known to our partners. However, we want to work on very practical issues. One of those is the bond, which we think can be achieved in tandem with the nuclear fuel bank proposals. We are also having a dialogue with recipient countries. We believe

Could we not inject a little more urgency into this issue? Can she not give the House something like a road map&#151;a fashionable phrase&#151;towards a decision on this matter with some timing factor? Is it not about time that a senior Minister of this Government set out Britain&#146;s overall policy on non-proliferation matters?</p>

At present, the IAEA is assessing a number of proposals, including that on the nuclear fuel bank. In June, it will present a paper to the board of governors outlining the results of its assessment. Quite properly, that assessment will naturally determine our future policy on this issue.</p>

For example, the Gulf Co-operation Council has decided to embark on a nuclear energy programme; the price of uranium has more than doubled, with the result that all kinds of miners are now coming into the field, many of them in countries which have no effective government; and, finally, there is the Russian decision to supply Iran with nuclear materials. Given all that, does the Minister accept that it is very important that the British Government take an urgent and indeed conspicuous view on the proposals for a fuel bank? Would they consider making a contribution towards financing the administration of such a bank, given that the situation is daily becoming more urgent?</p>

Of course, we must deal with these urgent matters. Whatever actions are taken, it is important that they are taken with the IAEA and on the basis of its assessment, which will be forthcoming in June. On the financing of a nuclear fuel bank, we await the assessment of the IAEA, which we will have in just five months' time. I agree that the matter is urgent but we must take decisions on the basis of the best knowledge and the best advice we can get.</p>

In those circumstances, while consistency might be a good thing, a little more speed in making the essential imperative decisions would also be welcome.</p>

The Government will bring forward an energy paper in the not too distant future which will deal with those matters. On the nuclear fuel bank and non-proliferation, it is absolutely right that we await the assessment of the International Atomic Energy Authority, as it has the most knowledge about these important issues and it is a multilateral organisation.</p>

Several different proposals are being considered&#151;I do not know which one the Prime Minister has endorsed. Is the Minister aware of the IAEA&#146;s projection that, whereas now 16 per cent of the world's electricity is produced by nuclear power in about 30 countries, at the moment 27 new nuclear power stations are being constructed? The IAEA believes, with some justification, that there is a huge expansion ahead of carbon-free or at least low-carbon nuclear power around the world. If it is not to lead to great dangers in the proliferation of weapons-grade uranium, that will require a very close and effective monitoring system indeed. Can she reassure us that the British Government take the issue very seriously, as do Japan, America, Russia and the other leading powers and that this is probably the way forward in a world that will be predominantly nuclear as regards electricity generation?</p>

The Government are working on the issues&#151;I do not want noble Lords to think that we are doing nothing between now and June&#151;and we are working with our colleagues, but we await the assessment of the IAEA before we take action.</p>

I thank my noble and learned friend, but who or what is to stop the false accuser in the case of Leslie Warren&#151;who has now been released from prison&#151;from making more false allegations against more innocent men? The police will have destroyed her DNA; they had no right to retain it because she was not prosecuted. The courts have given her lifetime anonymity under the law. The press will be prosecuted if they name her unless a Member of Parliament is prepared to raise it in the Chamber, which I am not prepared to do in this particular case. Is she to be left to carry on making further allegations in conditions that men can do little about until they get to court?</p>

Indeed, that was the basis of the Court of Appeal&#146;s decision that certain disclosures had not been made relating to previous allegations. That is the protection that others will have.</p>

In another case that has been discussed in this House, the police decided to keep details of a particular person at each police station. Of course it is possible for people to be deceptive about who they are and their name in order to prevent all sorts of information about them being made known. That is why I said &#147;as far as is possible&#148; this disclosure will have to be made. In the case that went to the Court of Appeal, however, it was discovered that there had been other allegations and the Court of Appeal was able to act.</p>

The decision was ultimately taken that whether a defendant has anonymity is quite different from whether women&#151;particularly those who would be deterred from bringing forward proper complaints because of the fear of disclosure of their identity&#151;should have anonymity.</p>

Does he agree that any hint of a change in the law could have serious implications for the victims of rape? It would perhaps make victims even more reluctant than they are now to come forward with a charge. Are any measures being taken to get a conviction rate that is better than the current very low one&#151;less than 6 per cent of those charged are convicted? That would help women who have been raped to come forward with a charge. Otherwise, the present situation will continue and most rapists will get away with it, making many more women more reluctant to come forward.</p>

As I indicated, we are considering&#151;my noble friend Lady Scotland considered&#151;whether there is a need to change the law in the light of the Blackwell judgment. That is probably because of the difference between the Court of Appeal&#146;s powers and the High Court&#146;s powers. As regards the conviction rate generally on rape, the Government hope to respond shortly following responses to the consultation paper on a number of changes on which we invited comments.</p>

But he knows&#151;this has come through in parliamentary replies from the Home Office&#151;that in the Warren Blackwell case the CPS failed to disclose all the information that it had and which should have been brought before the courts. Why cannot we have an early decision on whether the law can be changed in this area? My noble and learned friend has referred twice to the possibility of a change in law. Can we have a very early decision so that I do not have to table more Questions on this area and can move on to another area of rape law?</p>

Subject to other ministerial colleagues, I hope that we shall reach a decision soon. On the first point, the Blackwell case turned not so much on any non-disclosure, although I accept that there was non-disclosure, but on new evidence which had come to light which the prosecution did not have.</p>

However, neither the Government nor the commission believe that enforcing a policy of this nature is necessary. The licensing arrangements are primarily for the proper regulation of gambling, not sporting events. Nevertheless, the Government have put in place statutory and non-statutory arrangements which provide protections for both sporting events and the betting product.</p>

It is nothing to do with the Premier League, but concerns the club in which I have an interest, Forfar Athletic, which was made to play Peterhead with about eight sick men. I understand that the sum of &#163;250,000 was placed on fixed-odds betting. Forfar lost 8-0. I am not sure what the payout was, but corruption does not necessarily have to be in the Premier League. Can the Minister give me some advice on what might be done and, above all, on whether the rules apply on both sides of the Border?</p>

Would that be banned under the White Paper? There can be no question of chimera embryos being implanted in the womb; this is for research purposes only, to get round the severe scarcity of human embryos. Do the Government not realise that, if, tomorrow, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority decides in response to the Government&#146;s White Paper that the three applications before it should be banned, that would gravely damage Britain&#146;s reputation as a world leader in the field of stem cell research, which has attracted talent from all over the world, and endanger some very promising lines of research into serious disabilities that affect more than a million families in this country?</p>

I very much accept the noble Lord&#146;s proposition about the status of this country in the area of stem cell research. He will recall that in 2001 I took through the regulations that allowed that to happen. The success of the UK&#146;s approach has come from combining strong regulation with a development of regulation as science has advanced. We make it clear in the White Paper that we will not allow the creation of embryos by combining human, animal and genetic material as part of the current update, but we will put in the legislation to be brought forward a regulation-making power to allow for such creations in the future for research purposes, if it is so decided. That is consistent with the approach that has been taken for legislation in this area. We will bring forward a draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny, when all these matters can be debated.</p>

Such cells produced by tissue culture would be free of any significant component of animal mitochondrial DNA. At the same time, is it not right that the Government should do what they can to encourage the donation of spare human embryos in IVF programmes and, wherever possible and feasible, the donation of human ova for similar reasons?</p>

The noble Lord will know that the HFEA has made a recent decision in that regard. Our understanding is that the law is unclear about the regulation of human and animal embryos created by novel processes. That is partly why we have reviewed the current legislation and why we will bring forward a draft Bill for parliamentary scrutiny. We have to recognise that, on the one hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, suggested, there is great potential in research areas and that, on the other, there is genuine public concern about some of these developments. We are attempting to maintain a balance. I am sure that parliamentary scrutiny will help.</p>

The Medline index clearly shows that the numbers of publications from this country are falling. Does the Minister not agree that this is an example of an area about which there is very little public disquiet? There has been no evidence of that public disquiet of which he spoke. It is very clear that there is no possibility that such eggs, treated in this way, could become monsters or embryos that might be used for any purpose other than research. Under those circumstances, would it not be scandalous for this work not to go on to help human health?</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_117"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill. I am happy to say that I think I can be short in introducing it, because I said all that I want to say at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07010949000065"></a>I am concerned to ensure that the public interest stands at the forefront of the Bill. The Minister&#146;s brief may contain words to the effect that this is all unnecessary and goes without saying, but that is not the case. It is important that we do not succumb to political correctness or modern-day fashion by putting the consumer ahead of the public interest in its widest connotations. Protecting and promoting the public interest is a lawyer&#146;s prime duty. It sometimes means that they are, as I said at Second Reading, in conflict with the consumer, the client for whom they are acting. Nevertheless, it is a lawyer&#146;s duty to put the public interest first. I submit to noble Lords that that should be the first principle, ahead of consumer interest, in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="07010949000066"></a><b><a name="70109-0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07010949000293"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> I strongly agree. It is difficult to understand what has changed since the previous Lord Chancellor issued a consultation paper entitled <I>In the Public Interest?</I> I believe that he had it absolutely right&#151;it is very much in the public interest that the reform of the legal profession should take place. But the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has quite rightly noticed that the terminology has changed. It has suddenly become of concern to the Government that the reform of the legal profession should be in the interest of consumers and no longer in the public interest.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07010949000067"></a>I thank my noble friends who served with me on the Joint Select Committee. This matter came to our attention and, in our report published on 25 July, we stressed the importance of bringing back &#147;public&#148;. I pause for a moment to consider what that word means. It is much wider than the consumer interest. The consumer interest is important&#151;it is part of the public interest, but it is of course the interest of those who have used, or who use, the services. There is a much wider concept here, which was rightly recognised by the previous Lord Chancellor, that any move towards reforming what has always been seen as an independent, impartial legal profession must be in the interest not just of those who use the service, but of the much wider public interest.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07010949000068"></a>The Minister has already heard me say at Second Reading and previously that the definition of &#147;public&#148; covers what could be termed as being in the national interest&#151;the interests of this country as a whole. Is it in the interest of this country that we should have an independent, impartial legal profession? Of course it is. The consumer wants it pretty cheap, and quite rightly so, but not necessarily high quality. Although one always tries to seek the advantage of having not only value for money but also high quality, quality perhaps does not rate as highly as the cost with some consumers. Of course many consumers, particularly those of the criminal legal system, are to be found in most of Her Majesty&#146;s institutions. That we should be bringing forward reform in the interests of the criminals is not something which should be paramount in our minds.  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_118"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am glad that the Minister smiled because she dared me to say that in this Chamber. Well, I have said it.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07010949000069"></a>The public interest covers what is in the interest of UK plc. It is clearly in our interests that our legal profession should continue to be respected across the world. I have been lobbied by many senior Silks. It is the only time I have ever really come across them&#151;they tend to be exceedingly expensive. I remember once having breakfast with a very senior Silk who afterwards charged me &#163;2,500 for the privilege. I will not go into the detail of that case, but there are Silks who practise in other jurisdictions. There are lawyers, solicitors and barristers who practise across the world&#151;not only in Commonwealth countries and not only in those that accept the English system of common law, but on a much wider scale. It is therefore surely in the national interest that whatever bodies we establish under this Bill should be in the interest of UK plc.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07010949000070"></a>It has also come to our attention that these words apply not only to the Legal Services Board, but will apply to the Office for Legal Complaints and to approved regulators. Therefore, we are dealing with a very wide concept. I warmly applaud the words of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I took the opportunity to surf the internet just before this debate to try to work out a definition of public interest. Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia, directed me to &#147;common well-being&#148;, which is an interesting concept. It also reminded me that public interest is often contrasted with private or individual interest, so one could say that it is very different from consumer, private or individual interest. It is much wider. Wikipedia repeats the words of many philosophers throughout the ages who stress that the public interest is a crucial concept in much political philosophy. Protection of minority rights is arguably part of the public interest. It is also a defence against certain lawsuits.</p>

Therefore, &#147;the public interest&#148; is found not only in this amendment, but in other key locations. I could say much more on the subject, but it strikes me that the Minister has been listening carefully and nodding from time to time. Her body language is very acceptable to this House. Therefore, I will sit down and hope that she will respond positively.</p>

<a name="07010949000072"></a><b><a name="70109-0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07010949000294"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> I agree with everything that was said by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral. However, I have one reservation about Amendment No. 1, which relates to access to justice. Amendment No. 2 is preferred because, as was pointed out so clearly by my noble friend just now, the public interest qualifies the consumer interest. Having said that, the only justification for this Bill as amended is if it is in the public interest, which includes the interests of the client now referred to as the consumer.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_119"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07010949000073"></a>The width of public interest, which comes within the remit of the board, is fantastic. Before it makes any of its administrative decisions&#151;be they on directions, public censure, financial penalties, interventions, cancellations, designation, policy statements, practising fees, regulatory conflicts or, indeed, the licensing&#151;it has to take into account the public interest. It is a very wide remit. The amendment is of crucial consequence because it stands as guardian over all the other amendments to the Bill. My noble friend Lady Butler-Sloss&#151;she was once my learned friend&#151;said on Second Reading that consumer interest, if contrary to the public interest, is subservient to it. That is recognised by the drafting of Amendment No. 2.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07010949000074"></a>This is all very well, but there has been a fantastically wide delegation of powers to the board, which has been commented on by the Delegated Powers Committee. This raises the question of whether it should remain a matter of policy without some form of judicial supervision. It is a crucial consequence that the public should have confidence in the way that this proposed regime works. I suggest that they cannot have confidence in these circumstances, which are wholly exceptional, if there is no judicial control by way of judicial review.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07010949000075"></a>There are two aspects of public interest touched upon by my noble friend Lord Hunt. The first is the interest of the client to have independent and quality advice, which is in the public interest, too. The second is the standing of our legal professional as seen by other countries in the world.</p>

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="07010949000076"></a><b><a name="70109-0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07010949000295"></a>Lord Neill of Bladen:</b> I spoke on Second Reading about this Bill and should perhaps declare my interest as a practising barrister, former member of the Bar Council and once chairman of the Bar.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07010949000077"></a>It seems that there is no argument of substance between the two sides today, because the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, was good enough to write to me saying there was no need to be concerned about the public interest. She said that the Government shared our interest and had put in references to the public interest in Clauses 3(3)(c), 27(3)(c) and 113(3)(b), provisions dealing respectively with the Office for Legal Complaints and a couple of other bodies. They have put those words in to control the activities of the three most important bodies created by this Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07010949000078"></a>Once you concede that, there is really no basis in principle on which you can object to our proposal that the Bill should proclaim on its front the importance attached to the public interest&#151;and that it not be a matter of scurrying through a lot of clauses and getting as far as Clause 113, if anybody goes that far. We should put it right up on the front of the Bill, just like the White Paper that was put out earlier about the public interest. It fits very well beneath the reference to the rule of law but ahead of that to consumers. Without abandoning my colleagues on Amendment No. 2, I prefer the notion of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that this should go in as a separate provision, coming in as Clause 1(1)(c). That is the place it obviously belongs and it should be put in there. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for having written to me, and I hope we shall see further actions reflecting the body language witnessed earlier.</p>

But whether that be so or not, it seems clear that there must be a reference to public interest in Clause 1, especially as there is a specific reference to consumer interest. Of the two amendments, like the noble Lord, Lord Neill, I prefer Amendment No. 1.</p>

I do not intend to make heavy weather of that. I have listened carefully from the beginning to the arguments that have been advanced. As a consumer of legal services and many other things, I welcome the reference to the interest of the consumer in a Bill of this kind, while not remotely arguing that one interest should take preference over another.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07010949000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that the consumer interest may be best defined as people wanting to find the cheapest services that they can, which may not always be services of quality. That may be so in respect of certain consumers of certain services, but we should remember the phrase &#147;caveat emptor&#148;&#151;let the buyer beware. Certainly the cost of services, legal or otherwise, needs to be taken very seriously. So I shall listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s arguments as to whether the amendment is appropriate and necessary.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07010949000083"></a>I have no objection as a consumer to placing the interests of the public above that of consumers provided that the interests of the consumer are treated equally fairly and on the same line as the public interest. After all, we are at a stage and an age when the provision of legal services is always subject to very close scrutiny. Rightly, the legal profession, in its many forms, has its own monitoring and scrutiny arrangements. We shall come later to how those services can be better used to protect the interests of the public and the consumer.</p>

<a name="70109-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07010949000084"></a>I cannot see the Minister&#146;s body language from the back, but I have listened carefully and I hope that we do not make very heavy weather of whether the interests of the consumer or the public are paramount. As a member of the public, I fully subscribe to all that has been said about the interests of the public but I hope that I have made as strong a case as I can that the interests of the consumer are entitled to be considered equally.</p>

There is an important distinction between the point made by the Minister in her letter to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, and the point that we are considering. Amendment No. 1 suggests that the regulatory objectives should protect and promote the public interest. That is what I believe we should seek to do. The other three clauses&#151;Clause 3(3)(c), Clause 27(3)(c) and Clause 113&#151;simply require that those governed by those provisions &#147;have regard to&#148; the public interest. It is not quite the same thing. Protecting and promoting are stronger; the words are clear. I hope that the Minister, whose body language looks pretty useful, will rise to give us some comfort.</p>

I declare an interest as chair of the National Consumer Council. This Bill is about regulating the relationships between the legal profession and its clients. It is not about broader matters; it is about precisely that. It is therefore important that the consumer interest is given primacy. The two interests are not equal. On the face of it I would have no objection to a reference to the public interest. However, I have a deep suspicion that what certain protagonists here mean by the public interest includes a big chunk of the interests of the legal profession itself. I am not going to participate much in Committee, but my noble friend needs to be aware that some of the amendments tabled today raise that suspicion. Whatever concessions the Minister may be prepared to make, we need to be clear that this Bill is primarily about consumers. It should have regard to the public interest&#151;and there is provision for that later in the Bill, as the noble and learned Lord has just said&#151;but the purpose is to protect consumers.</p>

I was a little unnerved by the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, whose name is also attached to Amendment No. 2, but not to Amendment No. 1. At some stage&#151;I do not know when&#151;the noble Lord must have decided that he preferred Amendment No. 1 to Amendment No. 2. That speaks highly of the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who has obviously returned to your Lordships&#146; House in sparkling form and, with a few deft flicks of his paintbrush, has portrayed a very attractive case for Amendment No. 1. I congratulate him.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07010949000089"></a>Our reason for aligning, in Amendment No. 2, public interest with consumer interest is simply this: the Legal Services Board is entitled to intervene on the basis of any one of the seven criteria in Clause 1(1), so  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_122"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that if you have public interest as a stand-alone category, consumer interest is also left as a stand-alone category. For example, the Legal Services Board could intervene solely on consumer grounds, quite independently of the public interest. That is why we combine public and consumer interest: it forces the Legal Services Board to balance the consumer interest against the public interest before intervening.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07010949000090"></a>It is strange that public interest does not appear in Clause 1(1). Before the draft of the Bill became public, all the indications were that there would be a public interest provision. After all, the terms of reference for the Clementi report were the public and consumer interests. There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the Joint Committee, chaired so ably by my noble friend Lord Hunt, wanted public interest to be a category in the regulatory objectives.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07010949000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and so many other noble Lords who have spoken have rightly said that the public interest and the consumer interest will not always coincide. A number of your Lordships have hazarded a definition of the public interest, but to me the crucial ingredient of the public interest in this context is justice. The courts are here in the United Kingdom to attain justice; that is their role. There will sometimes be a conflict between the attainment of justice and the provision of legal services at a certain price. It is that conflict with which the Legal Services Board has to grapple. Unless the public interest is one of the objectives, there will be no requirement for the Legal Services Board to grapple with it. That is the worry.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07010949000092"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, has rightly drawn your Lordships&#146; attention to the letter from the noble Baroness on the three regulatory bodies in the Bill. I am looking at Clause 3, on the Legal Services Board. In Clause 3(3)(c), we see &#147;the public interest&#148;, but if one looks at the way in which Clause 3(3) is introduced, one sees that the requirement is for the board to &#147;have regard to&#148; the public interest. But, at the end of the day, having had regard to it, the board is not obliged to take it into account in its decision-making. This is a very weak provision in favour of the public interest. I very much support all your Lordships who have intervened to say that the absence of the public interest in Clause 1(1) ought to be rectified by the Government.</p>

I certainly do not think that the interests of the legal profession should be paramount; indeed, there are many stipulations in Clause 1(1) that would qualify the paramountcy of the legal profession. My concern about public interest is about the courts and justice, which is a very distinct phenomenon from the interests of the legal profession. Members of the legal profession are advocates in front of the courts, but the courts ultimately are run, and

<a name="07010949000095"></a><b><a name="70109-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010949000304"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am clearly going to have to keep my body under control during the passage of this Bill. I should not have said that; it begs enormous numbers of comments. None the less, by nodding at noble Lords I was trying to indicate that I fully understood the points that had been raised.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07010949000096"></a>For me, the public interest is why you regulate. Regulation is about something that we do as a Government to support the public interest. As noble Lords have rightly pointed out, the Government were very keen, in responding to the Joint Committee, to tackle the issue appropriately. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, referred to the letter that I sent to him and to the fact that in Clauses 3, 27 and 113 we have put in,</p>
<ul><a name="07010949000220"></a>&#147;have regard to ... the public interest&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010949000200"></a>for the specific aspects in the Bill. That was our attempt to respond to the Joint Committee appropriately. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral&#151;on whom we have all heaped praise for his chairing of the Joint Committee&#151;should just assume that I praise him each time I mention him, which will save us some time, for it is always at the back of my mind.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07010949000097"></a>What has changed? Nothing has changed. We felt that we had dealt with the issue appropriately in those clauses. I accept the concerns of my noble friend Lord Whitty. When the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, talked about the balance between the consumer interest and the public interest, it made me a little nervous, because I do not see it quite in that way. I accept&#151;and I wanted to listen to this debate very carefully&#151;that there is an issue that we have not quite got right in the Bill, and I am very keen to address it. I did not know whether we would go for the approach in Amendment No. 1 or in Amendment No. 2, so it was interesting that we had a mixture of both. Perhaps the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, found more favour in this particular debate.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07010949000098"></a>I worry a little that we are trying to balance something when in this instance the regulation, as my noble friend rightly says, is primarily about the relationship between the legal profession and the consumer, customer, citizen or client&#151;whichever word noble Lords prefer&#151;whom the profession is seeking to serve. That all takes place within the context of the public interest, whether the definition is from Wikipedia or from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I am very mindful of what my noble friend Lord Whitty has said. Indeed, in discussions, organisations that are particularly concerned about consumer interests have been keen to make sure that we are mindful of what the regulation is seeking to achieve. None the less, I think that we have something that we need to address and we will endeavour to do so.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07010949000099"></a>For my part at this stage, what I would say is that we are very interested in this debate, on which I will  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reflect very carefully. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, raised the question of judicial review; I know that he has an amendment later in the Bill that specifically tackles that. I had the opportunity to discuss with him earlier today the whole question of judicial review and I think that he will accept that we are absolutely confident that those who are being regulated will be able to go to judicial review where they feel that there is an issue to be resolved. But I think that we should wait for that debate to talk about the matter in greater detail, as other noble Lords may wish to add to that.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07010949000100"></a>So in essence we agree with what the Joint Committee was seeking to do. We believed that we had resolved it appropriately. If noble Lords believe that we have not, we will endeavour to do so, building on this debate and perhaps in discussion with those who put forward Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, but being very mindful of what my noble friends Lord Whitty and Lord Graham of Edmonton said about ensuring that we are clear about the purpose of regulation. I do not think that there is any difference between us. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will feel able not to press their amendments, and I shall return to the subject at Report.</p>

They seem to be two quite different approaches.</p>

The purpose of the phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; was to focus on the particular institutions, if I can call them that, in the Bill. The question that I was seeking to get advice and a steer on from the debate was whether by including the public interest with the consumer interest, as suggested in Amendment No. 2, that could put the public interest either in conflict or in a secondary position, or whether what we were seeking to do was to have an overarching principle within Clause 1 that would cover this. I need to reflect on where I think noble Lords have got to with that debate. That was really what I was seeking. The aim is not to say &#147;have regard to&#148; in Clause 1; it is rather to put this issue in a different position in order to reflect what I think the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, believes we did not quite get right from the Joint Committee.</p>

It is great news that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is there reminding us about consumers, which most of us are. Most of us know that the legal profession needs to be kept in order. There are all sorts of things we could say about it. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, may very politely say some of them during these proceedings and I may say, &#147;Hear, hear.&#148; But the public also understand very well the importance of the public interest because what a

People understand the importance of the rule of the law. I do not think that politically the Government need be frightened of giving paramountcy to the public interest. I think the public understand that but they also know very well that they need to be protected from lawyers.</p>

I referred to the general principle of &#147;in the public interest&#148; and now that my noble friend has spoken to Amendment No. 2, as have a number of other noble Lords, I should give an explanation. It was the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Select Committee that the words in Amendment No. 2 should be added to the Bill. Although the Minister has paid tribute to the previous Lord Chancellor, I do not think that she has yet quite explained why there has been a change in terminology. That is particularly important, in the light of the words of the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton. He reminded us that he is a member of the public; he is also a consumer of legal services, as are many members of the legal profession. But many members of the public do not use legal services; indeed, they spend their whole life hoping that they will never have to. It was once said that you can live without a lawyer but you cannot die without one. Lawyers ultimately catch up with people at some stage. Therefore, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor was quite right to question whether the legal profession was in the public interest. That is the key question.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07010949000106"></a>I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Kingsland for having spoken to the amendment that was tabled following the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Select Committee. I should like to explain why we were concerned about the Minister&#146;s response. The Government responded to the Joint Select Committee report by saying,</p>
<ul><a name="07010949000221"></a>&#147;we do not think it appropriate that the two&#148;&#151;</ul>

<ul><a name="07010949000222"></a>&#147;should sit within the same objective&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70109-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07010949000107"></a>Therefore we come back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen: is it right that these should be in the same objective? We discussed this in the Joint Select Committee where the view expressed was that of the noble Lord, Lord Graham. The noble Lord said that he was a member of the public but also a consumer. In those two capacities, his interests may not be exactly the same. His wish is to see the two taken into account. The terms of reference set by the Government for Sir David Clementi&#146;s review were that he should consider the public and the consumer  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interest. Those are the Government&#146;s words; they actually have said that there are two interests&#151;public and consumer&#151;and that both should be considered.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07010949000108"></a>As noble Lords know, I am a practising solicitor and I have always declared that interest. My worry is that putting the public interest where it is in the Bill, in the genuine belief that doing so was responding to the Select Committee&#146;s recommendation, has resulted in the worst of all worlds. Instead of the public interest being a regulatory objective and clearly set out on a par with the consumer interest, it is relegated in Clause 3 to something to which the board and the other institutions must have regard.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07010949000109"></a>All the Minister&#146;s words are authoritative but we need in this instance a particularly authoritative explanation of the difference between the public and the consumers&#146; interests. Why have the Government moved from their position that the reform must be in the consumer and public interests, as they said in their instructions to Sir David Clementi, to saying that the regulatory objective must include only consumers? It may well be that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has, behind the scenes, exercised such power and influence that he has won this critical battle. Judging by what he said to us earlier, it is, to him, a very important battle, but it is one on behalf of just a section of the public. We now need to ask the Minister to reflect on putting the public interest right at the heart of the regulatory objectives, not necessarily as the first objective&#151;they are not in any order, and we will debate that a little later&#151;but certainly back where it started under the noble and learned Lord, the previous Lord Chancellor.</p>

I say again that the Government took on board the recommendation and sought to achieve it in the Bill in two ways. One was to put it in the clauses that we have already talked about&#151;Clauses 3, 27 and 113&#151;to make clear the organs that are being developed under the Bill. But we also believed that, when the regulatory objectives were taken together, we had dealt with the public interest: if the regulatory objectives were being dealt with, then the legal professions would be operating within the public interest.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07010949000111"></a>Noble Lords have talked about the difference between the overarching public interest that is served by the legal professions and by regulation&#151;that is the point that I was seeking to make&#151;and the interests of those on the receiving end of the services where regulation is important in ensuring that a proper and fair deal is had. That, in a sense, was the point made by my noble friend Lord Whitty, who has lobbied me not at all on this issue. However, I am pleased to say that I have met representatives of organisations who have talked me through some of these questions from their perspective, and I am grateful to them, as I am to the Law Society, the Bar Council and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07010949000112"></a>Within this debate, we were looking to recognise the strength of feeling in this Chamber that this matter needed to be considered and to think about how best to reflect what noble Lords have said. As Members of the Committee know, the different

The view that I have taken from the debate is that we probably need to think about the public interest in a slightly more overarching sense. Obviously, I shall need to consult colleagues because I am not the policy Minister in this case, but I think that the sense of the debate is to go in that direction and I have no difficulty with that. But we also need to be mindful of the purpose of the regulation, which I think is where my noble friend Lord Whitty was coming from.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07010949000113"></a>I hope that I have answered the noble Lord&#146;s points. There was no desire to move away from the issue; it was simply that we felt that we had achieved what was desired. If we have not, we need to think about that. However, from our perspective, the combination of objectives ensures that the public interest is served; simply inserting it as one objective would not achieve what we thought we had achieved and might not be as good as what could be achieved if we thought about it again. I hope that the fact that I will talk to noble Lords between now and Report will be acceptable to the Committee.</p>

That is not the case. I think that putting the consumer first strengthens a perception among the public that it is only the consumer or client who counts. The lawyer is not the paid mouthpiece of the client who is prepared to say whatever the client will pay him to say. He has a much more independent position. Perhaps the public perception is that lawyers are just paid mouthpieces, but the discipline and ethos of the legal profession are entirely against that&#151;they are to act independently and to take into account the public interest first.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07010949000115"></a>If the Bill were simply about the relationship between the legal profession and the consumer, I am sure that it would be phrased in a much narrower way. However, the regulatory objectives in Clause 1 start with:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07010949000214"></a>&#147;(a) supporting the constitutional principle of the rule of law&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010949000202"></a>I do not see much about consumers in that objective&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07010949000215"></a>&#147;(b) improving access to justice;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07010949000216"></a>&#147;(c) protecting and promoting the interests of consumers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010949000203"></a>When the regulatory objectives are expressed like that, surely it is right to include that primary purpose of the legal profession to protect and to promote the public interest.</p>

<a name="70109-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07010949000116"></a>The Bill is not simply concerned with regulating the legal profession&#146;s relationship with consumers. The regulatory body, the LSB, has relationships with the Bar Council, the Law Society and other regulators and the regulatory objectives are to be used in connection with those relationships. I am very heartened by the expressions that we have heard from the Minister's lips&#151;I leave out references to other parts. In the course of discussions before Report stage, I hope that we can sort out this point. If not, we shall pursue it. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07010949000217"></a>: Clause 1, page 1, line 9, at beginning insert &#147;subject to the objectives in paragraphs (a) to (c),&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07010949000120"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 3 inserts the expression &#147;subject to the objectives in paragraphs (a) to (c)&#148; at the beginning of Clause 1(1)(d), so that it would read,</p>
<ul><a name="07010949000223"></a>&#147;subject to the objectives in paragraphs (a) to (c), promoting competition in the provision of services within subsection (2)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010949000204"></a>Promoting competition is clearly a desirable objective. It is of particular importance in the Bill in regard to alternative business structures, to which we shall turn later on in Committee. However, our view is that the introduction of such structures, or indeed any other matters concerning competition, should not be capable of overriding the three principles expressed in Clause 1(1)(a) to (c); that is, supporting the constitutional principle of the rule of law, improving access to justice, and protecting and promoting the interests of consumers. Only in the context of the achievement of those three objectives should the competition objective be given free rein.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07010949000121"></a>Quite apart from that point, I have two other issues on Clause 1(1)(d) I want to raise with the Minister. The first is that Clause 1(1)(d) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="07010949000224"></a>&#147;the provision of services within subsection (2)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010949000205"></a>which draws our attention to services that are provided by authorised persons. As a consequence of Clause 1(1)(d), will the OFT have responsibility&#151;the responsibilities of the OFT are excluded from supervising services provided by authorised persons&#151;or will the Legal Services Board and the OFT have co-responsibility for competition in this area? I am not sure of the position.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07010949000122"></a>I also ask the Minister about the expression &#147;promoting competition&#148;. I suggest to her that it is not desirable for the LSB to have a role in actively promoting competition. I understand that the LSB ought to be alert to anti-competitive practices and have the power to act where it identifies them. That is quite different from the active promotion of competition, however. The market, the authorised persons who want to engage in certain activities, should be free to do so. Only if they engage in those practices in an anti-competitive way should the Legal Services Board be able to act. It should not in itself be able to take initiatives which seek to enhance competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07010949000123"></a>The Minister has not been given notice of that observation, and I understand if she wants to reserve her position at this juncture. We must at some stage, however, be clear about the relationship between the Legal Services Board and the competition powers in the Bill. I have said enough to give the Minister a basis upon which to respond, and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07010949000125"></a>I understand entirely what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is getting at. We do not want to be unduly restrictive by putting in the Bill a duty on the regulatory bodies to consider one objective subject to another. In any case, it may sometimes not be relevant. Of course, there are other areas of concern, where other groups, individuals or Members of your Lordships&#146; House or another place might consider that the ranking should be different and that there should be a paramountcy of one objective above another, or that some are stronger than others.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07010949000126"></a>We were keen to ensure that the regulator was able to look at the objectives in the round and weight them as it saw fit. The Joint Committee recommended that the Explanatory Notes should make it explicit that the objectives were not listed in order of importance. We agreed with that, and the Explanatory Notes reflect it. The way we have done this reflects David Clementi&#146;s recommendation that the board, the Office for Legal Complaints and the regulators would be best placed to determine which objectives and principles were the most important in a particular instance. That is the right way to approach this.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07010949000127"></a>As the noble Lord said, the promotion of competition is an important objective and should be considered appropriately. However, those looking at what is happening in the regulatory framework should weight the objectives as they see fit. I understand what the noble Lord seeks to do. Clearly, there will be circumstances where different objectives need to be looked at in a different way, with some coming into play and some not. That is the regulator&#146;s role. It is not for us to try to rank them in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07010949000128"></a>On the Office of Fair Trading, I looked at what we did in the Compensation Act 2006, because the competition issue had been raised. During the passage of that legislation, the Office of Fair Trading pointed out to me that it does not have responsibility for competition for any regulator designated under that Act&#151;or, therefore, under this Bill. Behaviour of individual firms and individuals remains subject to the competition enforcement provisions in the normal way and, therefore, under the OFT&#146;s supervision. We were able to satisfy your Lordships that we had addressed the need for competition as an important part of both consumer and public interest approaches to the legislation.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07010949000129"></a>I am not sure that that fully answers the point about the Office of Fair Trading, but I hope that it demonstrates that we have looked at the issue. I shall talk further with the noble Lord to ensure that I have picked up all his concerns. None the less, that is why we do not want to put the ranking in the Bill; it is for the regulator to determine.</p>

We do not dispute the desirability of having competition as one of the objectives.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07010949000131"></a>By the end of this stage in your Lordships&#146; House it is desirable that we have a clear idea of the precise responsibilities of the Legal Services Board. We have to remember that, at the end of the day, all this regulation is paid for by the professions. I think that they would rightly view with alarm the Legal Services Board turning itself into a fully fledged competition authority, particularly if it were an authority which had the power to promote competition. The possibilities are lamentably endless. It is not just a question of legislative precision. The legislative precision has very practical consequences for everyone being regulated under the Bill in terms of how much it will cost them. The issue of competition perhaps goes a little wider than my amendment envisaged. I apologise to the noble Baroness for broadening it out beyond what I suspect she expected to respond to.</p>

One of the advantages of Committee is that it enables us to look more widely. Perhaps I may remind the noble Lord that the OFT&#146;s competition scrutiny is provided for in Clauses 56 to 60. That might address some of his concern. Within the Compensation Act, with the regulation transferring to the Legal Services Board, the OFT&#146;s position has to shift slightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07010949000133"></a>I shall be happy to talk further about competition. It is an important area. We had a number of interesting discussions in Committee on the then Compensation Bill about the meaning of &#147;promote&#148;; the relationship with the Office of Fair Trading; the importance of competition to benefit consumers&#151;we broadly accepted it in that piece of legislation as we probably shall do in this&#151;making sure that the language is right; and so on. It would be interesting to do so again.</p>

I was unaware, therefore, that the matter had been fully debated in that context. My concern is about boundary lines and demarcation. My objective is to make sure that we understand exactly what the Legal Services Board can and cannot do. I do not have a particular view at this juncture about what powers the board should have; but I am clear that whatever it has must be crystal clear on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07010949000137"></a>It is fair to point out that competition is normally advantageous to the consumer, which makes it appropriate as an objective for the regulatory provisions of the Bill, but it is not necessarily universally so, and it is possible that the body would have to pick and choose between different regulatory objectives in reaching a decision, even in the interests of the consumer. It would be possible to lose sight of the consumer in promoting competition. It would be theoretically&#151;indeed, more than theoretically&#151;possible to promote competitive behaviour in order to benefit the providers of the services. It is clear that if it came to an evaluation of which criteria and objectives should be given weight in the event of a conflict between the regulatory objectives of promoting access to justice and promoting competition, then the promotion of access to justice would clearly appropriately be given priority. I see no harm in spelling that out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="07010949000138"></a><b><a name="70109-0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07010949000319"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> We think it is for the regulator to determine in a particular set of circumstances which objective is weighed in the balance against which. If one was ranking the objectives, there are organisations that would wish to see consumer interest, for example, ranked as number one, but other organisations would rank other objectives first.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07010949000139"></a>Our view is that, when faced with a particular proposition, one should look at the objectives in that context. Competition is important. Noble Lords may feel that it is less important generally but, in a particular set of circumstances, it might for particular reasons become extraordinarily important because of what it is providing for the consumer, public interest and so on. It is in the public interest to have competition. All we are really arguing about is who should deal with it. Our view is clear: it should not be for your Lordships&#146; House to determine the ranking. Points have been well made about the sets of circumstances the regulator needs to look at, how it should weight the objectives in the balance, and which are relevant, which are not and which should carry more weight. That is absolutely right and proper. It does not mean that I disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said.</p>

Clause 1 applies not only to the Legal Services Board but also to the Office for Legal Complaints and to all the authorised regulators. These three different types of regulators have distinct and disparate functions. Perhaps the most startling difference is between the Legal Services Board and the authorised regulators. The Legal Services Board, as the Government have said on many occasions, is essentially a supervisory board, supervising the work of the other regulators. By contrast, the authorised regulators are the front-line regulators. Under the Bill, the Legal Services Board, in principle at any rate, intervenes in the work of an authorised regulator only if that authorised regulator is alleged to have been in some way delinquent.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07010949000145"></a>To have one set of regulatory objectives to cover three types of regulatory authority with very different responsibilities is not a sensible way of proceeding. It means that the regulatory objectives have to be so broad and loosely defined that they cover all three types of authority, but, because they seek to cover all three, each one is insufficiently pinned down by the objectives for the Bill to give an accurate picture of what it ought to do. Therefore, the regulatory authorities will have far more freedom of manoeuvre to act than they ought to have. The basis on which I oppose the question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill and tabled Amendment No. 3A is that there should be not one, but three, objectives clauses in the Bill: one for the Legal Services Board, one for the Office for Legal Complaints and one for the authorised authorities. That will enable the draftsmen to be much more specific about what it is that each one of these separate categories of regulatory authority ought to do.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07010949000146"></a>My draft of the new clause in Amendment No. 3A is submitted almost in the spirit of a probing amendment. Proposed subsection (1) seeks to set out what I consider the board&#146;s regulatory objectives ought to be&#151;the objectives of the board alone&#151;but I entirely understand that other noble Lords might take a different view. On mature reflection, I, too, might want to change the categories in proposed paragraphs (a) to (e) either to alter one or more of them or to add to them, but the point of principle is that each separate regulatory authority ought to have its own distinct objectives.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07010949000147"></a>We would then get from the Bill an understanding of the precise relationship that each of these authorities has one with another. It ought to have an extremely beneficial effect on the disease of what is often described as &#147;regulatory creep&#148;, which we find so often in other fields of regulation. I emphasise as I did when promoting the previous amendment that, because this is a self-financing scheme, it is particularly important that those who are paying for this regulatory regime are very clear about what they are getting for their money. The present structure of the Bill does not provide that.</p>

In our Joint Committee&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, may correct me if I am wrong&#151;we did not quite appreciate that Clause 1 would apply not only to the Legal Services Board and the Office for Legal Complaints, but also to the approved authorised regulators. I can therefore see that we would have liked to spend a little more time on this area.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07010949000149"></a>As my noble friend Lord Kingsland pointed out, similar bodies being set up have carefully defined objectives. My main concern with these regulatory objectives is that there is a great deal about what the bodies are to do but very little about what they should not do. Duties are a very useful way of setting out exactly what we expect of a body. I look forward very much to some more detailed amendments, perhaps on Report, but in the mean time we seek an indication from the Minister that she is prepared to look at this, just to ensure that when we create these bodies we give them carefully defined terms of reference. We will debate in greater detail later amendments setting out the need to avoid overlap between the approved regulators and the Legal Services Board and the need to act in partnership.</p>

<a name="70109-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07010949000150"></a>I am persuaded by my noble friend that we ought to look at setting out very carefully, succinctly and in exact terms what we expect of these bodies. We will expect different things from each body. The Legal Services Board is seen as the overarching regulator, but the detail is left to the front-line regulators. The Office for Legal Complaints has a completely different persona; we want it to sort out complaints and ensure that those who wish to complain are treated quickly, promptly and efficiently. There is a need for that; indeed, some would say that the main reason for the Bill, apart from the original OFT report, was that the area of complaints had a cloud hanging over it. Without ascribing blame to anyone, I suggest that there was a feeling that the whole business was not being dealt with as efficiently as possible. However, I am not sure that the Office for Legal Complaints will have the same regulatory objectives, duties and powers that we will give the Legal Services Board, or equally the same as those we would want the approved regulators to have.</p>

If you have three different boards with three different sets of objectives, all slightly differently worded, and something that is in set one is not in set two, or differently worded in set two, are you not promoting the most wonderful field day for lawyers to produce enormously complicated arguments? They could argue, for example, on the basis that set one says &#147;x&#148;, but set two says &#147;x with y added&#148;, and set three says &#147;x with z excluded&#148;. You would be asking

Would it not be better to have a wider set of principles that apply to all three sets and allow the person doing the work and anybody asked to adjudicate on that work to say, &#147;These are all the objectives, but this one is less important in the context of the work that my body is required to do&#148;? I thought of this only while the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was speaking, but I wonder whether he is not simply creating a very profitable field for our profession.</p>

<p><a name="07010949000206"></a>popped into my head and I wondered whether we had a series of regulatory objectives applying to the Office for Legal Complaints that were different and that excluded one of the criteria or objectives. There would be considerable uncertainty about why that was so. My mind is by no means closed on this, but if the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, were to come up with some specific examples of where it would be inappropriate to apply some of the proposed regulatory objectives to all the bodies that the Bill seeks to regulate or to provide the means for regulating, then perhaps the case might be a little stronger. In principle, it is likely that each case considered by the Office for Legal Complaints or the Legal Services Board would give rise to different factual circumstances, which may mean that different weights would be given to different objectives. But I think that the objectives broadly spelt out&#151;particularly if they are amended to include the general objective of the public interest&#151;would be pretty transferable between the bodies to which the Bill applies.</p>

In a sense, we began from Sir David Clementi&#146;s final report, in which he said that the first step of establishing a regulatory regime should be to make clear the objectives of that regime. That is what we have sought to do in Clause 1, bearing in mind what I have already said about public interest. It reflects what I think the noble Viscount is alluding to. We wanted to say, &#147;This is what the regime should be about: there are different players within that regime, but these are the objectives that should cover the regime&#148;. We wanted to be very clear about what those objectives ought to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07010949000155"></a>The report then goes on to say&#151;and this is critical for those charged with regulatory responsibility&#151;that those who have separated the regulatory and representative function should carry out their regulation in accordance with those objectives and subject to the oversight. So these are, in a sense, the founding principles. We also go on to say under Clause 48 that the board may make policy statements. We think that this may be an area that we could explore in the context of what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is seeking to do. I share the noble

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07010949000156"></a>My inclination is to say that we need a founding set of principles for the regime. But it may be that under Clause 48, which provides for the board to make policy statements, we can do more to set out what we would be seeking to achieve and how the regime and the overarching regulatory objectives would translate into the work of the individual players, without pre-empting what we would wish to happen, which is that the board itself should be working closely with the different regulatory bodies in figuring out precisely what they should be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07010949000157"></a>I am keen to discuss this matter and I am not averse to trying to be clearer, particularly about the Office for Legal Complaints, about which noble Lords have raised issues. But I would be loath to try to set this up in three different sets of objectives in the Bill, because it would be confusing, as others have indicated. We can continue to discuss this. There may be other ways of seeking to clarify further what the policy statements would be and the rules that would follow on from those. That is the way that we have often sought to demonstrate further what the Government are seeking to achieve in discussions about legislation in your Lordships&#146; House.

My objective is for the Bill to be clear about the objectives and functions of each one of the three regulators. In my view, the Bill as drafted is not sufficiently clear. It is undesirable, particularly in a self-financing regulatory regime, for there to be imprecision in this area. It may well be that my proposal is not the optimal solution, but the situation as it stands is wholly unsatisfactory. There may be another way of achieving what I am seeking to achieve. The Minister suggested Clause 48 and we may be able to look at other clauses. However, I also accept that there is the duty on me to go away and look at the objectives not only of the Legal Services Board but of the Office for Legal Complaints and the authorised regulators, and try to come up with a set of objectives that accurately reflect what I think should be the responsibilities of these three regulators. The Minister has been kind enough to say that her mind remains open on these issues, and we shall have time between now and Report to make some progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07010949000167"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to an important part of the Bill, dealing with the independence of the Legal Services Board. The danger seen generally and reflected in the speeches at Second Reading is that the Legal Services Board be thought a body set up simply to introduce government influence into the legal profession. I am sure that is not the intention of the Government, and it is important that they make that absolutely clear in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07010949000168"></a>The Legal Services Board is going to deal with a number of bodies&#151;to take two, the Law Society and the Bar Council, which will presumably be approved regulators&#151;that are well established, with a long history of self-regulation and completely independent of government. It is essential that the Legal Services Board itself be seen to be independent and to carry weight. It will deal with people in the profession who know that profession from the roots up. The board, consisting as it will of a number of lay persons, must demonstrate that it is a weighty body capable of giving directions, and independent of any government or political interference.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07010949000169"></a>The Bill simply provides that the Secretary of State, unnamed&#151;it could be any Secretary of State, perhaps even the Home Secretary&#151;is the person who appoints the Legal Services Board. We do not think that is adequate. The importance of giving stature to the board is such that the Bill ought to follow the procedure in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Your Lordships will recall that when it was decided that the Lord Chancellor should cease to have the function of appointing

In our view, the appropriate level of appointment is that set out in Section 85(1)(b) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, whereby the appointment is made by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, but a recommendation which is informed by the selection process of the commission set up under that Act.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07010949000170"></a>The sort of office holders that Section 85(1)(b) referred to are, for example, district judges and people of considerable importance and rank, certainly of no less or greater rank than one would envisage in a member of the Legal Services Board. Removing the appointment of members of the board from simply the Secretary of State&#151;who can appoint anybody&#151;to the mechanisms used for office holders seems a sensible way of proceeding.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07010949000171"></a>We will later debate in Amendment No. 5 and the amendments grouped with it the proposal that the appointments be made with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. I am sure that the objectives of those who tabled those amendments are exactly the same as mine&#151;that is, to ensure independence, integrity and weight. In my view, it is far better to go to the machinery that we have in place, although it may need some amendment. It would require us to amend the first part of Schedule 14 to the Act to include members of the board as appropriate office holders, which could be done by a simple order by the Lord Chancellor. But we believe that the Lord Chancellor should be the person who makes the appointment and recommendation from a selection by the commission, and it is Her Majesty&#146;s appointment that guarantees independence. I beg to move.</p>

There then arose the question of who would open the proceedings of this Chamber on Friday 12 June 2003. I think that I have the dates reasonably exact. A message came through from No. 10 asking whether this House would kindly agree to give the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor permanent leave of absence&#151;or, at least, leave of absence for that day so that the whole mess could be sorted out. If I recall, this House decided not to give him leave of absence. I then have this wonderful picture, which I shall carry with me to my grave, of a small, rather rotund figure, encompassed in a huge wig and massive cloak, suddenly emerging as the new Lord Chancellor, re-established&#151;</p>

Although I will be speaking to Amendment No. 5, to which I have attached my name, I look forward very much indeed to hearing the Minister&#146;s explanation as to why the Government decided on this course of action so far as the appointment is concerned.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07010949000185"></a>On several occasions I have heard Ministers reassure us all from the Dispatch Box that there is no need to worry because Nolan principles will apply. Of course, this is very much part and parcel of my experience in government. I was the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster who set up the Nolan committee to examine standards in public life. I recall our discussions with that committee when it established the seven principles of public life. Indeed, there was a feeling that those principles did not need to be spelled out, because they were so much part and parcel of what we all accept in public life; they are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. They are features that have always been there in our public life and it was slightly sad that we needed to spell them out in such terms, but it is good now to have them on record.</p>

<a name="70109-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07010949000186"></a>Although the Nolan committee at the time said that standards of behaviour in public could not be said to have declined, there was a perception that they might have. It was that perception that it tackled. It did not in any way substitute any other principles or guidance for the appointment of key people to government quangos, public bodies, et cetera. It did not remove the final arbiter of public appointments, namely the Minister concerned. Indeed, I recall that in his report the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, spelled out in no uncertain terms that, when dealing with appointments, nothing that the Nolan committee produced removed the responsibility of Ministers to make the right appointment. This, therefore, is my response to members of the Government who keep quoting the Nolan principles. Indeed, nothing in the Nolan principles is substituted for the need to take consultations. As in this amendment, nothing in the Nolan report would inhibit Her Majesty the Queen&#151;or, indeed, the Prime Minister&#151;in making what they believed to be the right appointment. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 laid down a number of key principles and procedures that need to be followed, which is why I was persuaded by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that this is, indeed, an amendment to which we should hear the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

It is obviously deeply undesirable that the board that regulates the independent legal professions should be appointed by a Minister such as the Home Secretary, who has such plain conflicts of interest. I do not anticipate that the Government would be likely to move the position in practice so that the Home Secretary could do that, but some Government could do it, and I can quite easily hear such a Government saying that Parliament had approved it because it simply required a Secretary of State to do it.

It may be that it is already on the record, and that I am just ignorant.

Nevertheless, the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is interesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07010966000002"></a>Where I find myself in complete agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is over the substitution of the Lord Chancellor for the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can be any Secretary of State. However unlikely it might seem to your Lordships, I suppose one might foresee in future responsibility for the Legal Services Board being transferred, say, to the Home Secretary. Could your Lordships&#146; House be confident that the Home Secretary would have the same consideration for the rule of law as would the Lord Chancellor? After all, the Lord Chancellor is statutorily bound by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 to take into account the rule of law. It is an obligation which is expressly placed on the shoulders of the Lord Chancellor. No Secretary of State is similarly encumbered.</p>

At least if it is the Lord Chancellor alone who is taking this decision, he is obliged to take it in the context of his obligations with respect to the rule of law. No Secretary of State is under&#151;</p>

He was focusing, as I understand it, on the words of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 expressing a statutory obligation on the Lord Chancellor, but would he not agree with me that every Minister in any Government is obliged to uphold the rule of law and is governed by the rule of law? Whatever may be added in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 does not subtract from that obligation which should never be let go of.</p>

If, by any remote chance, one of his Cabinet colleagues fails to take the rule of law into account in formulating a policy or in drafting a Bill, then the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is bound by virtue of his obligations under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 to intervene. So in my submission, the Lord Chancellor does have a very specific and special obligation in relation to the rule of law which is not shared by other Secretaries of State.

Indeed, if he looks at the evidence given by the noble and learned Lord to the Constitution Committee, I think he will find that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has himself expressly recognised that he has a more positive and a more intense duty than that generally imposed on Ministers. I certainly think it is right that the appointment should be made by him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07010966000008"></a>I confess I do not understand why the two sets of amendments are being treated as alternatives. The Lord Chancellor&#146;s recommendation can be made with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, whether it is the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor. The person should not be appointed without the concurrence of the head of the legal profession because he will be regulating it, and if the people concerned are incompatible, there will be chaos. It is therefore a mistake to treat the two sets of amendments as alternatives&#151;they are cumulative. If the recommendation has to be made by the Lord Chancellor, the need for the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice is slightly less because the Lord Chancellor would be more likely to consult him. However, they are both highly desirable. The present amendment is essential and would fly in the face of the division of responsibilities which the Lord Chancellor has set out.</p>

Others feel that if I answer regarding the Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor, I will have strengthened&#151;or weakened&#151;my case when we come to Amendment No. 5. Let me deal with the specific amendments before us; I hope that as we move through and noble Lords reflect on this, more of a picture will be created.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07010966000013"></a>Two issues have emerged from our debate: the first is how we ensure independence. Noble Lords would feel varying degrees of comfort, depending on the role of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and Her Majesty the Queen, but the underlying issue is to make sure that this is done independently. There are ways of ensuring that noble Lords can be comfortable that the board is independent that do not necessarily require these amendments. I have had discussions with noble Lords and various organisations and there is a fundamental principle I do not shy away from as an area where people are looking for ways to be encouraged that this is the case. The Government argue that the way we have set it up is right, and I will say more about that shortly.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07010966000014"></a>Secondly, we are setting up a regulatory regime. Set practices under this Government and previous Governments for establishing such regimes have served us well. The Financial Services Authority, the Office of Fair Trading, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Competition Commission were all appointed by Secretaries of State; they all serve us well and are considered by everyone to be independent. We have reflected on how best practice has been established and has grown up to set up a regulatory regime. The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments would play the key role, and the code of practice&#151;noble Lords will be familiar with it, but I am happy to place a copy in the Library&#151;sets out the principles under which that should be done. Ministerial responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny, equal opportunities, probity, openness and transparency, and proportionality are the principles under which appointments are made.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07010966000015"></a>The code of practice, which runs to some 65 pages, is specific about how these things will be done. We should pay tribute to the commissioner&#146;s office for its work in that regard. The code was clarified and amended in part in August 2005. Some noble Lords may not be familiar with it and, before we reach the next stage of our debates, I strongly recommend that they look at it because it contains the principles and the basis on which appointments will be made. We believe that they reflect independence, openness, transparency and merit as the key principles within the seven that I indicated with which one would go about making appointments.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07010966000016"></a>We have sought to apply regulatory regimes and current best practice. We have been very clear and consistent in saying that that is precisely what we would do. No one has suggested to me that any of the other bodies that have been appointed either under the practices at the time or current practices are anything other than independent, open, transparent and all the things that noble Lords would seek. I begin from that principle, but I also recognise that noble Lords are looking to tease out the matter, to

I look forward to the succession of debates that we will have on the back of this one.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07010966000017"></a>On the amendment concerning the role of Her Majesty the Queen, of course Her Majesty is eminently qualified to exercise her jurisdiction in relation to some public appointments but, in this case, we do not believe that that is necessary. For the reasons that I have given, we believe that the procedure should be that used in appointing the eminent regulatory bodies that have already been set up, and it is not appropriate to link these appointments to the Judicial Appointments Commission. That commission was set up to do a different job and involves a different set of skills. In my view, it is doing fantastic work but it is a different job from this one, and we think that the regime that we are proposing under the OCPA rules is the best one to take forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07010966000018"></a>I know that I have not addressed all the other issues that will come out in debates on the other amendments, but I hope that I have given the basis for rejecting this amendment.</p>

I want to make a point that I do not want to elaborate on but I think that it would be rather hypocritical of me simply to go along with what the Minister said. I believe that an objective analysis might find some difference in the degrees of independence of some of the bodies that have been appointed from time to time. I speak as a lawyer and have obviously declared my interest and I might be thought to be parti pris on this, but the importance of independence of the legal professions in any free society is great. Their duty to stand up to Governments and to the sometimes overweening power of the authorities of whatever sort, sometimes in moments of great unpopularity, is such that we should seriously consider a method of appointment which is even more clearly independent than the others. Of course, I support all the Nolan principles and those that the Minister has so eloquently adumbrated, but I am not completely happy in my own mind that they always work. We should continue to pursue with a good deal of vigour what we are seeking to achieve by this and related amendments.</p>

Nothing that I have said is meant to imply other than the importance of the role that they and, separately, the judiciary play and the value that we place on them. I am simply trying to elaborate the fact that a regulatory regime covering how the consumer, customer, client or whatever relates to someone who is providing a service should have a framework around it, and that is what we have sought to do. I have already indicated that I understand that noble Lords around the Chamber see a need to think about independence as being of especial importance because of the nature of the profession that we are

That passage of her speech was of some importance. On reflection, is that really what she was saying?

I am seeking to make the point that, because it is the legal profession, the issue of independence is one about which noble Lords feel passionately. On this series of amendments, we are probing, challenging and prodding the system as it currently stands to see what more, if anything, might be done. The Government are content that we have a good independent system through the OCPA rules. Quite reasonably, Members of the Committee are challenging that and together we are thinking how to take this forward.</p>

It is not entirely satisfactory to say that she will return to some of these arguments later, because this amendment has been advanced as a proposal very closely following the argument that was

Those arguments are much closer to the present circumstance that we are considering in this amendment than are the arguments about the regulation of financial services. It is extraordinary simply to seek to sidestep it. It is very difficult to understand where the objection comes from to what is proposed here. We are not picking holes in other systems of regulation, but what holes are the Government picking in this proposal? It seems to me that that has not even been hinted at.</p>

I have argued that a closer example of what we are seeking to do is to set up a regulatory regime based on what we know works well. No noble Lord has really challenged that.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07010974000006"></a>I commend the argument advanced by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, that the amendment lies nicely with Amendment No. 5 of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, ensuring that there is a concurrence of the senior judge. Those two amendments are not mutually contradictory; one does not have to pick and choose between them. I hope that the Government will see the force of that argument and accept it.</p>

The independence of the judiciary is guaranteed in this country because there is also an independent legal profession. If the Minister had ever had the experience I have had of appearing in jurisdictions where one has one&#146;s doubts about the independence of the judiciary, she would appreciate much more keenly how important it is that the legal profession retains its independence and is seen to do so by any means possible. That is why an analogy with other bodies or professions which are subject to regulatory regimes is inappropriate. I am not claiming that the legal profession is above everything else but it has a particular role to play in the constitution of this country: that is, the independent role of people who will stand up and shout against the Government. The history of this country has been illuminated by lawyers who have been prepared to do that. To this day, the arguments against government are pursued not only in the courts of this country but also in the European Court of Human Rights. Standing up against the Government is in large part what the legal profession is about. If the Government are going to introduce a body which is to control, to regulate, the legal profession it is in their interest to ensure that it is seen to be as independent as possible of government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07010974000008"></a>The Home Secretary is a Secretary of State. Many times during the past few months the current Home Secretary has criticised the judiciary and lawyers because of this conflict. He does not stand in the same position as the Lord Chancellor, who has that statutory obligation regarding the rule of law. He is a person who gets involved on the government side. It would be disastrous if it were thought that a Secretary of State could put the squeeze on the legal profession in one way or another because he was not happy with the independent stance it was taking. It is an important point of principle that we have to pursue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07010974000014"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 5 and the other grouped amendments raise issues which have been foreshadowed in the debate just concluded. The wording of Amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 12 is entirely that of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, whose name is rightly one of the names in support of the amendments. The issue is simply that the Bill as it stands puts too much power in the hands of a Minister both in relation to the appointment and the removal of the chairman and members of the Legal Services Board. This is so in spite of recommendations that came from the review conducted by Sir David Clementi and from the Joint Committee on the draft Legal Services Bill chaired by my noble friend Lord Hunt.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07010974000015"></a>In the final report of his review, Sir David concluded that these appointments should be made by the Secretary of State in consultation with a senior member of the judiciary. It is quite clear from looking at the evidence that was given to the Joint Committee in written form or orally that a large number of witnesses were extremely concerned about the proposed manner of appointment to the board. Those concerns were reflected in the committee&#146;s final report. The Joint Committee recommended that appointments to the board should be made only after full consultation with the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07010974000016"></a>Your Lordships may recall the response of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor at Second Reading when he referred to the Lord Chief Justice as being somebody who consumers,</p>

<p><a name="07010974000100"></a>Of course, although he started out as a member of the legal profession, the Lord Chief Justice is a judge. He is, indeed, the head of the judiciary; and I hope that, on reflection, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor feels that he may have overstepped the mark somewhat in making his observation.</p>

Running through the Bill, one cannot help but form the opposite impression. It is not just in appointment and dismissal that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has such a powerful role; there are other matters in relation to the operation of the Legal Services Board where, in our view, the Lord Chancellor&#151;or the Secretary of State, as he is described in the Bill&#151;has overweening powers.</p>

<a name="70109-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07010974000018"></a>It is for those reasons that we tabled these amendments. Some powerful speeches were made at Second Reading about the importance of the independence of the legal profession. We heard a most eloquent speech from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, in winding up on the previous group of amendments. I do not propose to add to that in any way because I think the subject has already been adequately dealt with by other Members of the Committee. We on these Benches regard this amendment as crucial. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07010974000020"></a>Noble Lords will find that recommendation 10 comes out of paragraph 142, which is part of chapter 4 of the committee&#146;s two-volume report. It is one of the things which persuaded me, having for the first time been put on a pre-legislative committee, of the important role that a committee can perform once a draft Bill is in existence. It can then assemble evidence from all parts of the kingdom, reflecting all shades of opinion, as to what people think of a sharpened up proposal post-Clementi.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07010974000021"></a>One of the main points in the evidence which struck me&#151;noble Lords will find it in volume 1, chapter 4 of the report&#151;is the degree of fear being expressed by very different people about the threat to the independence of the legal profession. It is very striking. When noble Lords get a chance to look at page 42 of volume 1 of the report, they will see a list in footnote 119 of all the people who expressed worry about this topic. I shall give the Committee a couple of examples of the wide spectrum of opinion on this issue. One comes from a source which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, were he still with us today, might say is a typical example of lawyers feathering their own nest. The example comes from the evidence that we received from Clifford Chance, which was once upon a time in the City. It said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000102"></a>From the other end of the spectrum&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;the Law Centres Federation said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07010974000116"></a>&#147;We share the concerns of others, about proposals for the appointments to the Legal Services Board to be made by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. In our view, this will not give sufficient confidence in the LSB&#146;s independence from Government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000103"></a>This is quoted in paragraph 134. People have seized on who will fill the key post of chairman of this newly created body, with its wide jurisdiction and powers to give direction to the front-line regulators. That is the breadth of the anxiety which is felt. Sir David Clementi used the first formula that we had in our report,</p>
<ul><a name="07010974000126"></a>&#147;after consultation with the senior judiciary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000104"></a>Noble Lords will find that quoted in paragraph 139.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07010974000022"></a>Perhaps I may mention a point on which I touched at Second Reading and which we ought to keep in our minds as we look at the evidence as the Bill is debated and we hear more from overseas. We have received evidence, particularly from the president of the Law Society, of comments made in overseas legal centres and cities by those who, she suggested, were rather jealous of the big inroads which the English legal profession had made into the legal profession within the European Community. They were using this Bill as an argument for saying, &#147;Well, you&#146;re really ceasing to be independent in the UK. You&#146;re having a government-dominated system&#148;. I have not heard this said first hand, but I want to keep an eye on it. I hope that the Government, equally, will watch it to see how much reality there is in it.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07010974000023"></a>Even if we set aside the overseas dimension and forget completely how we will be regarded from overseas, how will we be regarded internally? I think that I have said enough to show that we have received a lot of evidence from within this country of concerns about independence. This is number one in the list we made in the report of the points at which independence is seen as being under threat. The numerous powers vested in the Secretary of State is another point, but independence is number one in the list.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07010974000024"></a>Why do we wish to insert the words, &#147;with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice&#148;? It is really very simple. I thought back on my career as a barrister and remembered cases in my experience where the relevant statutory requirement has stated that, &#147;X must be consulted before such and such an act can be done by a Minister&#148;. I have come across unfortunate examples of what has turned out to be perfunctory consultation. In other words, the Minister says, &#147;Yes, I wrote him a letter saying, &#145;This is what I propose to do, but I should like to hear within seven days any comments you have to make&#146;&#148;. So far as the law is concerned, provided the letter is written in good faith, that is &#147;consultation&#148;. I have become worried about it as being a fetter in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07010974000025"></a>If one can suppose that there could ever come a time in this country when the judiciary was not best of friends with the Executive, or when the Executive were

We therefore propose that the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s involvement should be set at a higher level. The Lord Chief Justice would have to concur in the appointment and not merely to have been consulted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07010974000027"></a>I shall say a brief word in support of what the noble Lord said about perception. As many of your Lordships will remember, perception was a key feature in the argument which the Government used during the passing of the Constitutional Reform Act. It was said over and again that the Law Lords, for example, must be removed from this building to the Middlesex Guildhall because they were not perceived to be independent so long as they were sitting here. If perception is important from that point of view, surely it is equally, perhaps even more, important from the point of view of the establishment of this body. If the chairman of the Legal Services Board is appointed by a Minister, it will be perceived by people&#151;perhaps not by people with as much knowledge of these things as we have, but by ordinary people&#151;as making the profession less independent of the Government than it should be. If that is true of the appointment of the chairman and members of the LSB, it is surely even more true of their removal from office, which, again, can be done by the Secretary of State. That point was not greatly emphasised by the noble Lord, but it does arise under Amendment No. 24. The provision to which it relates must be amended for the very same reasons. The dismissal of the chairman and members of the LSB seems to be absolutely contrary to any idea that the body is independent of the Government. I hope that the amendment will be approved in due course, as well as Amendment No. 24.</p>

My plea is for those at the bottom of the profession. I more or less abandoned my limited practice to remain in academic life and to take part in the proceedings of your Lordships&#146; House in the 1970s.

It may be thought that independence is being talked of as some great luxury, but it is not a luxury; young barristers come to observe it as integral to their role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07010974000029"></a>I am not saying, and I do not take other noble Lords who have spoken as saying, that the Government intend to interfere with that. But I can say with total conviction that if young students of mine were going from my seminars into a profession regulated by a board&#151;I emphasise heavily the word &#147;regulated&#148;&#151;they would think twice about whether they still intended to occupy their position as they rose through the ranks of their chosen branch.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07010974000030"></a>It is therefore essential that young students, who have no direct voice in your Lordships&#146; House, know and can see in legislation that a new regulatory power introduced by the Government over the profession that they intend to enter is appointed and exercises its powers with the maximum number of conditions imposed. They must be able to see that those whom they recognise as reasonably independent of government have a place in such matters. I believe that the Government will come to accept that that must be made clear in the Bill because I believe that they intend that the profession should remain independent. However, the profession must be made clearly to appear, from a student&#146;s point of view, to be still in that condition.</p>

But I have to point out that the Law Society of Scotland, somewhat surprisingly, feels very strongly about these amendments; it is strongly in favour of them. This part of the Bill applies entirely to England and Wales, but the Law Society of Scotland believes that, should it be enacted as it stands, a politically appointed regulatory body over Scotland&#146;s regulatory bodies may be established or at least proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07010974000032"></a>The Scots Parliament has just legislated for legal services, having passed the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill before Christmas. The Bill does not contain provisions for a regulatory board but provides for a complaints commission. During the passage of that part of the Bill, the Parliament inserted a provision that the senior judge in Scotland, the Lord President of the Court of Session, should play a part both in the appointment to the commission and in the provisions for dismissal. That was felt strongly in Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland very much hopes that Parliament here will ensure that such arrangements exist for the regulatory board.</p>

Sir David was quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, who so ably chaired the committee, as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07010974000117"></a>&#147;Given the need for independence, and the objective of the rule of law, it seems right that the judiciary should be involved in the appointment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000106"></a>He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07010974000118"></a>&#147;The proposal of this Review is that the appointment by the Chairman and Chief Executive should be made by the Secretary of State in consultation with a senior member of the judiciary&#148;.

</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000107"></a>The Committee should consider carefully that view when deciding on this Bill. It is worth emphasising that Sir David Clementi did not support the conclusion that the appointment had to be made with the &#147;approval&#148; of the Lord Chief Justice, or with his &#147;concurrence&#148;&#151;if there is any difference in the meaning of those two words.</p>

No, there were two divisions, but this division was initiated by the noble Lord himself, in relation to the words that he has just referred to. This is in no way critical of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, as he was absent for very good reasons, but, had he been present, the vote would have been tied. I say that only because there were differing views within the Joint Committee. Therefore, I would not disagree with a word that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, has just said&#151;that was our conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07010974000040"></a>But even that conclusion does not meet with the approval of the Government and it is right to remind ourselves that, until this moment, the Government have not given ground on anything in this area, whether on &#147;in full consultation with&#148;, or &#147;with the concurrence of&#148;, the Lord Chief Justice. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Bach, will know, my preference in that division was for the word to be &#147;concurrence&#148; rather than &#147;consultation&#148;. It was an amendment at the time&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07010974000043"></a>What has the response of the Government been? I quote from the speech of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. At Second Reading, he dismissed our recommendation in these terms:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07010974000119"></a>&#147;The Joint Committee ... suggested that such appointments and dismissals should be made only after full consultation with the Lord Chief Justice.

<p><a name="07010974000109"></a>I wanted to emphasise the importance of knocking that down. The Lord Chief Justice is not just another lawyer in the process; he is a judge. He is not only a judge; he is the most senior judge. He is a judge of independence and integrity who is seen as having that independence and as being full of integrity. He is in a special position. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, is right to single out the Lord Chief

This is really the whole point of the debate&#151;to try to persuade the Government that there should be something in the Bill that makes it clear that the Lord Chief Justice has to be involved in the appointment.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07010974000044"></a>To some extent we are in the dark, as came out in the previous debate. We do not know who is going to be the Secretary of State. At the moment we are in abeyance. We do not know who is going to be the Prime Minister later this year, although we have our suspicions. We are told by Mr Brown that it will probably be him. I do not know whether it will be. What I know is that this House sadly failed to persuade the Government that the Lord Chancellor should be a Member of this House. It also failed to persuade the Government in a number of other respects&#151;that he should be a lawyer and so on. Therefore, later this year when Royal Assent is looming for the Legal Services Bill, we may be faced with a Secretary of State who is not in this House, who is not a lawyer and who is first and foremost a party person. Indeed, there are some who are clearly seen as party people, while others are seen as more statesmanlike. I do not know. The Minister indicates that it may be her, in which case a lot of my fears are removed. But it may be anybody.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07010974000045"></a>When we are dealing with the appointment of a quasi non-governmental organisation&#151;a quango&#151;that is going to regulate an independent legal profession, a signal needs to be sent. As the president of the Law Society and chairman of the Bar have constantly reminded us, there are foreign, protectionist jurisdictions that would love to have the opportunity of pointing the finger at the legal profession in England and Wales, saying that it is controlled by government and giving examples.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07010974000046"></a>The Minister will recall that our Joint Committee was concerned that there were a number of references to the Secretary of State&#151;in fact, there were 111. When I revealed at Second Reading that the number of references to the Secretary of State had increased from 111 to 288, I placed somebody&#146;s health in jeopardy; it is the only time that I have ever been interrupted in Hansard&#151;it is at col. 1180&#151;by a noble Lord saying, &#147;Good gracious!&#148;. But the Minister has sought to reassure me by saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010974000128"></a>&#147;the number of times the Secretary of State is mentioned does not necessarily correlate to the number of powers he exercises. In addition, I would also like to stress that we have sought to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s role in respect of a number of different functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000110"></a>Fine, but still the number has gone up and it was calculated on exactly the same basis&#151;not the number of functions but the number of references. The number has still gone up from 111 to 288. The Bill grows and so does the role of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70109-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07010974000047"></a>In that context, it becomes increasingly important that the power of appointment and indeed the power of removal should be seen as a power exercised by a non-political Minister. We would have far preferred it to be a Lord Chancellor in the mould of predecessors in that office. Nevertheless, if the power is to be exercised, it must be done at least in consultation with

Certainly the Lord Chief Justice should be named in the Bill as not just another lawyer and not just as a representative of a consumer organisation, but as the symbol of an independent legal profession of the greatest integrity respected across the world. That is why the Minister must start to give ground and begin to explain to us what she would accept and what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor would accept, which would communicate right across the world that nothing is going to change and that the English and Welsh legal system will still be the independent legal profession that is widely respected globally.</p>

I suppose that is what gives rise to this issue. I look forward to the noble Lord&#146;s support if we ever propose an amendment that includes the Lord Chief Justice in the Bill as being an individual with whom the Secretary of State should consult.

The Scottish Parliament has taken a view on the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission and the role of the Lord President of the Court of Session exactly as she identified.

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07010974000052"></a>I cannot resist going back to the 288 references, because I went through them on the back of what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said at Second Reading. There were so many of them. A whole range of other clauses&#151;45 clauses have been added over time&#151;are actually about the Secretary of State being the conduit back to Parliament, so although it feels like a huge number, I ask Committee Members who are concerned about it to recognise that it is quite often the best and most effective way of making sure that, for example, we have affirmative action by the Government. Indeed, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee refers in a number of cases to that. Although it feels like a huge number, Committee Members should recognise that the vast majority are positive because they are ways in which Parliament is able to hold the Government to account about what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07010974000053"></a>My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been very careful never actually to say that he expects to be Prime Minister. He has said that decisions will be made by whoever leads the Labour Party and is therefore Prime Minister. For my part, I will be perfectly delighted if he becomes Prime Minister, but he has never said it and I should make that clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07010974000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, and other noble Lords made interesting points. I am grateful to the chairman of the Law Society and indeed the chairman of the Bar Council, who have discussed the international perspective with me. I will spend a weekend in Dresden with the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of Ministers under the presidency of the German Justice Minister, and I have already planned to talk to her about the position. I know that the German Bar has often been raised as an issue. I have also talked to the European Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, in my capacity as the representative of the DCA on European Union matters. She is very keen and interested in what we are doing on legal services and has a positive perspective about the opportunities that there could be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07010974000055"></a>I have not received any representations of any kind from international bodies, and I do not believe that there have been any to the department about what this might do, but I will do my own research by talking to colleagues in other countries. If I find any information, I will put it to your Lordships&#146; House as well as to my colleagues in the department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07010974000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, also mentioned the value of pre-legislative scrutiny. I agree completely. The importance of that may be the only thing I agree with him completely about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07010974000057"></a>My noble and learned friend&#146;s remarks have been referred to two or three times. He was not referring to his own view of either the office or the office holder of Lord Chief Justice, which both he and I would hold in the highest esteem, both as an individual and as an office. He was referring to the perception that exists&#151;of which I have heard. I am not saying for a second that it is correct, but there is a perception that the Lord Chief Justice is an eminent lawyer, of the profession and therefore part of it. The noble and  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, talked about perception in the context of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Inevitably, if you are trying to deal with consumer confidence, you have to be alive to the issue of perception. It is not the prime reason why I do not accept the amendment, but it is important. My noble and learned friend was referring to that. He would be the first to argue the eminence of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, and the first at the barricades to support the role of the Lord Chief Justice, so I hope that his words will be taken in that context. I am positive that that is what he meant, having looked at <I>Hansard.</I> We should not forget that perception is important, and think about it in this context.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07010974000058"></a>There are lots of issues relating to the debate about concurrence or consultation. I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is saying and agree with the differences that my noble friend made between the two. The noble Lord argued that you could not actually appoint somebody if you were doing it in consultation with anybody else and they disagreed with you. But other organisations would feel strongly that they should also be consulted, not least perhaps some of the more eminent consumer organisations that have worked closely on this Bill and feel passionately about the importance of the issue, and there may be others. We are not saying under any circumstances that the Lord Chancellor would not consult people; we are saying that we do not want that specified in the Bill. If an amendment were proposed to make a change about consultation, I fear that the Government would reject that too. We do not think that it is right to have one individual as the only person who would be consulted. There would be opportunities&#151;indeed necessities&#151;when the Secretary of State concerned would be keen to consult people about the right appointment.</p>

I hope that he will participate in our debates at some stage and take the opportunity to put the record straight. I also hope that the Minister is not closing the door as she appeared to indicate, but is prepared to reflect on the considerable body of opinion that has been expressed in this Committee.

However, it is clear that there is a perception that organisations do not differentiate, and why should they?

I was indicating that the principle that Members of the Committee are looking for is to ensure that we have fully considered the issue of independence and whether further steps could be taken. Noble Lords are clearly suggesting that they would not be satisfied unless those steps were on the face of the Bill. I take that away, and I listen with great care. I was not committing to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that there would be something on the face of the Bill that I might return to, because I simply do not know. I will not make a commitment that I cannot guarantee I could honour.</p>

I am not going to attempt to sum them up; your Lordships have all spoken so perceptively about these issues that nothing further needs to be added. I will just draw out  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_161"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two matters which I think are particularly germane to the way the noble Baroness has responded on the issue of independence.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07010974000074"></a>First, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, rightly reminded us that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was driven wholly by perceptions. The Government were at pains to emphasise that there was absolutely no evidence whatever that any judge had ever been suborned; and the only reason why the Appellate Committee was being physically removed from your Lordships&#146; House and renamed was because there might be a perception that it was not independent. It is a mystery to me why that should have been the over-riding consideration for the 2005 Act yet not a consideration at all when it comes to this Bill. As all your Lordships have emphasised, the perception of independence is almost as important as the fact of independence.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07010974000075"></a>The second issue has already to some extent been rehearsed in the earlier amendments introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;the link between the independence of the judiciary and that of the legal profession. For liberty to be entrenched in our society, it is vital that both are independent. You cannot have an independent judiciary if you do not have an independent profession. With great respect to the noble Baroness, this is the real flaw in her argument. In responding earlier to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, when he advocated the Judicial Appointments Board as the appropriate model for selecting the Legal Services Board, she said, &#147;We do not see it like that at all. This is a regulatory authority like any other regulatory authority&#148;. I suppose she means the authorities that regulate gas or telecommunication. Yet it is because of the link between the independence of the judiciary and that of the profession that this approach by the Government is deeply flawed.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07010974000076"></a>This is not a regulatory authority like any other. It goes to the heart of the liberties of this country and it cannot be treated like any other regulatory authority. The model of the Judicial Appointments Board, advocated by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, is a much more appropriate model with which to approach appointments to the Legal Services Board than is, for example, the telecommunications regulator.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07010974000077"></a>That, in my respectful submission, is the crucial point that I hope the noble Baroness will take away and reflect on between now and Report. She must know that there are strong feelings in the House about this issue. She will know that unless the Government play a different tune when this comes back, this House will vote and we will defeat her. She can be in no doubt about the strength of feeling on this issue. There will have to be movement on the Government&#146;s side if we are to find some solution other than one of direct confrontation. We all regard this issue as absolutely central to producing a good Bill. I can see her nodding, but characteristically smiling at the same time. I do not think she is in any doubt about the direction in which we are all heading. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07010974000121"></a> Schedule 1 , page 112, line 12, leave out sub-paragraph (3) </p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07010974000082"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 8 refers to a line in Volume II of the Bill, on page 112, where it refers to the powers of the Secretary of State to determine the size of the Legal Services Board. Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 1 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07010974000122"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by order amend sub-paragraph (1) by substituting for the limit on the maximum number of persons for the time being specified in paragraph (c) of that sub-paragraph a different limit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010974000113"></a>On the face of it, this is a quite extraordinary provision, because it suggests that, by what I understand to be a negative order, the Secretary of State can expand or contract the size of the board. It must be perfectly clear to the Minister as to the scope that that might give to a Secretary of State for manipulating the size of the board and therefore producing decisions from the board that would be different from those produced by a board differently constituted. The Minister may have a benign explanation for this measure; I cannot anticipate what she is going to say. But if the power is unconstrained, as it appears to be, I suggest that it is wholly inappropriate. We would certainly, on Report, in the absence of any explanation or offer to constrain the power in some way, want to remove it from the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

We were treated to a very helpful report from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which spent quite a bit of time going through the Bill. Indeed, I recommend to noble Lords that we should spend time going through the instances that the committee set out. The Minister started off by saying that the Government would bring forward amendments to meet the concerns and recommendations of that committee, including, presumably, on this amendment and power. It might well short-circuit a number of debates if the Minister could give us greater detail about how she proposes to amend the Bill in line with the committee&#146;s recommendations. I recognise that she may not be able to do that immediately, but in the little while before the next day in Committee it would be helpful if she could give some indication of what she intends to do.</p>

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="07010974000084"></a><b><a name="70109-0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07010974000169"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I thank the noble Lord for that opportunity. It will not surprise him to hear that I do not want to go into detail on everything now. The position that I hold is that we accept the recommendations on specific points that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee asked us to consider. There are a number of areas on which it has asked the Government and this Chamber to think further, and we will listen with interest to what is said on those matters.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07010974000085"></a>I shall give what I hope is the benign explanation of these provisions. We set out in the framework of the Legal Services Board that it should have a lay majority,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_163"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but we have also been very clear that, as there is regulation of different bodies, expertise and experience is needed on the board as well. In future, the Legal Services Board may take on two or three new areas of regulation that are not currently covered. I shall not speculate on what they might be; they may not exist, but they might. Indeed, there are amendments to the Bill that we shall come to later that suggest at least one area in which that might be the case in future. If that were to happen, the board might reasonably wish to add on someone with expertise in those professions, which would lead to the lay members becoming a minority. So the power is specifically to enable the Lord Chancellor or Secretary of State to come in and, by order, improve the numbers so that the lay members remain the majority. It is reasonable to ask whether, if that is the only circumstance, it should not simply be put in the Bill&#151;but, as always, those are simply the circumstances that we can think of at the moment. I cannot think of any others, but there might be some.</p>

<a name="70109-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07010974000086"></a>The issue that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raises is that the Lord Chancellor may be able to sneak something under the wire by negative procedure. One way in which to address his concerns would be for me to take the matter away to allow us to make it an affirmative rather than negative resolution. That would mean that, if the numbers were to be expanded, it would have to come through a debate in this Chamber and another place, so nothing could be done that would suggest that the Secretary of State was trying to increase the numbers for other reasons. The noble Lord also has the knowledge of my remarks, which are in <I>Hansard</I>, about the purposes to which the provision will be put. If there were other purposes, the Minister&#151;whether it was me or another Minister&#151;would have to explain in full detail to this Chamber and in another place precisely what was being done and why. I hope that that addresses the noble Lord&#146;s concern. He may not wish to answer that directly now, but I put the offer on the table.</p>

I am certainly not going to reject the offer of an affirmative resolution, which seems to me a step in the right direction. On the face of it, the explanation that she gave, if not falling wholly into the benign category, is certainly a plausible one. I hope that she will consider, between now and Report, trying to find an alternative form of words to those that appear in the Bill, which might reflect the purposes for which the provision was inserted in the first place, as she describes them. I still take the view that the measure is too widely cast; but she is now on record in <I>Hansard</I> as saying what she is saying. Perhaps, in the intervening time between now and Report, the Minister might consider the drafting of that sub-paragraph to see whether she could make it reflect more accurately the purpose that she set out in her speech. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07010974000090"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments grouped together give the Minister the opportunity to address a central issue of our previous discussions&#151;why the Secretary of State and not the Lord Chancellor. Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 17 deal with appointments to the board by the Secretary of State. Amendments Nos. 20 to 23, 25 and 26 deal with the removal from office of members of the board by a Secretary of State. Amendments Nos. 27 to 30 deal with borrowing and accounting, and Amendment No. 36, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, primarily deals with reports to Parliament.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07010974000091"></a>There are two possibilities why the term &#147;Secretary of State&#148; is introduced. The first is that the Lord Chancellor is now to be regarded as a title of an honorary kind and that his office within the Government is now to be known as Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, in which case we should cease thinking of the Lord Chancellor as anything other than a title with little power. The second explanation is that the Government envisage that control over the Legal Services Board should pass from the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or the Lord Chancellor to another department of government. That is the point at which we all become particularly concerned.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07010974000092"></a>The position of Lord Chancellor is at the apex of the legal profession. Anybody who has achieved that office is devoid of further ambition because there is nowhere higher to go. It is the absolute pinnacle. Consequently, a person holding the office of Lord Chancellor has been able to hold it without concern for his own personal future or the future of anything else. He fulfils the duties of that office. The office of Secretary of State, on the other hand, may&#151;particularly if the Secretary of State is in the other place&#151;be held by a person with departmental or non-departmental responsibilities. It may be held by an ambitious person, who wishes to make their way and is therefore anxious to please those in power within his or her particular party at a given time. The Secretary of State is a very nebulous concept.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07010974000093"></a>We believe that appointing members of the board&#151;and, in particular, removing them from office&#151;should remain in the hands of the Lord Chancellor. We still wish to uphold that office, not as a title to be handed around within the Government as a bauble, but as representing a person who, as hitherto, has reached the very top and has no further ambition. The purpose of tabling these amendments is to enable the Government to give us a full explanation of the use of the expression &#147;Secretary of State&#148;. I look forward with interest to what the Minister will have to say. I beg to move.</p>

It would be tempting in those circumstances for one or other of those Secretaries of State to rank other considerations higher than the rule of law. The Lord Chancellor, by contrast, would be

For that reason alone, I wholly support the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford.</p>

I know that we have debated this already and that reference has been made to the positions of the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State under this Bill. We are in something of a quandary, because when we have a Lord Chancellor, who is responsible for the operation of the legal system and is required, under his oath of office, to respect the rule of law, we have confidence that the occupant of that post will follow the example of his learned predecessors and maintain the independence of the legal profession and all the other values that we have talked about in today&#146;s debates.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07010974000096"></a>The transition from a Lord Chancellor to a Secretary of State is an uncomfortable one. This Bill refers only to a Secretary of State, who could be any of the Secretaries of State. We are filled with nervousness about the transitional period. That is why I am very grateful to the noble Lords for tabling this series of amendments and to my noble friend for his amendment&#151;Amendment No. 36, I believe. Responsibilities could be transferred to a Minister whose other departmental responsibilities would cause him or her to give less weight to the importance of maintaining an independent, strong, diverse and effective legal profession. That is where we are all coming from. These are not great party-political issues&#151;far from it. We are united in wanting to see reform of the legal profession that maintains all the very high standards that we have been so proud of. We want to continue being proud of the international standing of the legal profession of England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07010974000097"></a>As I understand it, responsibility for these issues currently rests with the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, rather than with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, as a result of a transfer of functions order, made shortly after that initial decision to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor, which was then reversed. At the time&#151;and I am not criticising anybody in this House&#151;the issues raised by that transfer of responsibility were not properly considered, either publicly or in Parliament. Ensuring that the functions rest with the Lord Chancellor would help significantly to demonstrate to sophisticated international audiences that the new structure for regulation of legal services does not open the legal profession to political control. That, in essence, is what we are talking about: political control from a government Minister. The fact that the Lord Chancellor is required, under his oath of office, to respect the rule of law, would reinforce that.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07010974000098"></a>If the Bill were to be amended along the lines suggested, it would also be desirable to ensure that the position could not subsequently be changed by a transfer of functions order. This could be done by excluding the functions concerned from the permitted scope of orders under the Ministers of the Crown   


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Act 1975, in much the same way as was done in respect of the Lord Chancellor&#146;s functions relating to the judiciary in the Constitutional Reform Act. I very much hope that the Minister might reflect on that. I note that the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill refers only to the Lord Chancellor. It would be very helpful if the noble Baroness could explain why that Bill differs so fundamentally from this Bill, which refers to the Secretary of State.</p>

When the noble and learned Lords, Lord Irvine of Lairg and Lord Mackay of Clashfern, were Lord Chancellor&#151;and, indeed, for the whole of my legal and parliamentary life&#151;it was absolutely axiomatic that if the Government or a member of the Government sought to stray from the law, which sometimes happens, it would be made clear that, if the matter were not immediately corrected, the Lord Chancellor and the law officers would resign. There would be a constitutional crisis of massive proportions. I would like to think that that still applies. I shall listen very carefully to what the noble Baroness says in her explanation.</p>

Although I do not accept, as noble Lords would expect, that other Secretaries of State would not carry out their role fully, I understand completely what noble Lords are saying about the role of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. When the Constitutional Reform Act was completed&#151;noble Lords will remember the concordat in that&#151;certain elements were classified. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, referred to the example of the transfer of functions order, which sat in the remit of the two positions embodied in a single person. The legal professions rested with the Secretary of State. That is a very simple explanation of why it ended up there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07010979000002"></a>I have listened with great care, and I have said in all these debates that I am keen that we reflect as a Government on the issues where noble Lords are rightly and reasonably saying, &#147;We hear what you say, we do not necessarily agree with you, but we think that you need to think about independence&#148;. I know that a number of noble Lords, including the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, who is not in his place, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the fact that my case is weaker because I do not look at this amendment properly and fully. Noble Lords will notice that I am not speaking from notes. Therefore, I am going to accept the amendment. We will have to make consequential amendments to the Bill because I do not think, with the best will in the world, that noble Lords have captured all the references. I am prepared to accept the amendment, but I am not prepared to go as far as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, is asking me to at this point, which is to put something in the Bill that says that you cannot

I know, because I have checked, that we do not need another transfer of functions order if I accept the amendment, which goes a long way to doing that.

I will not go any further down that lane; my feelings are well documented in debates in this House.

The Bill says that the first one is not a lawyer. Noble Lords will agree with me on that. The first chairman should positively be a non-lawyer. Subsequently, we leave it open for the normal rules to apply, because there may be someone with appropriate experience who happens to have been qualified as a lawyer and who we would wish to see appointed, and we do not want to rule that out for ever.

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07010979000019"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 14 concerns the definition of a &#147;lay person&#148;. Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 contains the definition of a lay person, which prohibits, in all circumstances, anyone who has been,</p>
<ul><a name="07010979000073"></a>&#147;an authorised person in relation to an activity which is a reserved legal activity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010979000054"></a>In other words, it prohibits anyone qualifying as a lay person who at any stage of their career has been a professionally qualified lawyer. In our submission, this prohibition is too severe. I am sure that the noble Baroness can think of a number of examples, as I can, of individuals who, at a very early stage of their lives, qualified as a solicitor or a barrister, and might or might not have practised for a few years, and then went on to do something entirely different, perhaps for as many as 20 years. It seems to me to be unnecessarily limiting the field for selection to exclude people of that sort. Indeed, one might well argue that they were particularly well qualified because they had knowledge of the profession and yet had sufficiently wide experience outside it to put their knowledge in perspective.</p>

<a name="70109-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07010979000020"></a>In sum, we believe that the definition in the schedule is too absolutist and that the Government should qualify it in the way that we have set out in the amendment, or find some other way of including that class of people who have had an early experience of the profession and who have moved on to other activities which would otherwise qualify them as lay people, had it not been for the fact that they became professionally qualified and briefly practised early in their career.

But I think that there are still quite a number of people who obtain legal qualifications, practise briefly and go into other lines of business or other professions whom the Government would have no reason to wish to exclude from serving in the way that this Bill provides. It might even be considered an oversight to have been so restrictive in this respect.</p>

I do so only because I was rather disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Lofthouse, failed to move the last amendment. Perhaps the Minister can help me. If the first chairman is to be a lay person, but not any subsequent chairman, could not subsequent chairmen bring with them the baggage of the legal profession and use their position as chairman to lay down the basis for an improved legal career thereafter and therefore rather misuse their post? It is just a point that occurred to me and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Lofthouse, may well have been right in the amendment that he did not move.</p>

I can see the good sense of the first chairman not being a lawyer in practical terms and I am sure the word &#147;perception&#148; may emanate from the Ministerial Bench at some point in the reply. But if I had done more homework, I think I could have produced a rather surprising number of people of enormous independence who just happen 35 years before to have qualified as a solicitor or something of that nature, or possibly to have passed the Bar exams and done a pupilage but nothing more, who would be excluded. All I would commend to the Minister is that she might, with the assistance of her department, go away and think about it and see if a sufficiently clear form of words could be found which did not exclude quite a lot of the field.</p>

It is very important for there to be a huge statement of confidence in the first chairman bringing in the transition, and we think it right that that should be a lay person. We have said subsequently that that should not be a criterion that is overarching. A number of criteria will be considered. I do not really think I have to say to the noble Lord that someone who is quite clearly coming in to enhance their own career would be spotted through the process along the way. Lots of discussion goes on about the people who put their names forward, so I am less worried about someone doing that than he perhaps is. I am not sure about 10 years, either. I think 10 years is quite recent, particularly in your Lordships&#146; world. But I do take

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07010979000026"></a>What I would like to do is take this away. I have had one brief discussion with my noble and learned friend about this today. We wanted to do two things: have a think about what we might do, and talk to the consumer groups that feel very strongly about this to explain our thinking so that we keep that balance right. I will come back with a suggestion perhaps for the next stage. But the point that is being made is that somebody who a very long time ago qualified and practised briefly in law and is the eminent person may be debarred. I had rather hoped that this would be in secondary legislation. This is a classic case of where being able to amend something because you have moved on would be better, but it is in primary legislation so we need to think about how we make sure we do not exclude eminent people of the future. I take the point.</p>

<p><a name="07010979000056"></a>et cetera. Really, this amendment seeks to do what the Select Committee recommended in our report; namely, that there should be some reference in the Bill to Nolan principles. We have already dealt with Nolan principles, but this amendment would ensure that all

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07010979000035"></a>This amendment is not only in line with the recommendation of the Joint Committee, but a number of other bodies have said how strongly they support such an amendment. Of course it follows on from our discussions about the independence of the legal profession. The Bar Council has stated that it believes that this amendment would enshrine the Nolan processes without explicitly referring to them by name, and would ensure that we get the best possible people. In our Joint Committee we recommended that Nolan itself should be in the Bill. We recommended that recruitment by Nolan processes should be included explicitly on the face of the draft Bill. But I think we would recognise that this amendment in effect does that a little more discreetly, because from time to time these principles may well be changed, improved or further amended, so by putting &#147;Nolan&#148; in the Bill we may be unnecessarily restrictive. The Select Committee&#146;s belief that adherence to the Nolan principles should underpin all government appointments is strongly held. For the actuality and the appearance of independence, it is important to maintain that there should be a statutory requirement in the Bill to ensure that those principles are followed.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07010979000036"></a>In effect, the amendment would underpin the independent nature of the members of the board. It is a provision that at all times a majority of members of the board should be lay persons. That is why the previous amendment was so important in ensuring that the definition of &#147;lay person&#148; would not exclude people who in the past have had some legal training or experience. Whatever one feels about the Legal Services Board, I think we are all unanimous in believing that its members have to be the best possible people. That is why we need to ensure that the right processes are followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07010979000037"></a>Comments are always made&#151;indeed, there has been a recent report by a think tank&#151;that some appointments are political or include members of a particular political party.

I talked about the principles upon which we operate and about the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, which works across government. The implication of the amendment could be that a Minister appointing in this set of circumstances did not agree with those principles and would prefer something else. I am not suggesting that any Minister would go by a different set of principles, but let us go through the theoretical proposition. I am a bit nervous about the language that the noble Lord has chosen because it implies that a choice rests with the individual. We believe that there are clear guidelines and principles for appointments made by Ministers; the commissioner has a duty to engage with the Minister at the moment of appointment. The Minister is in that process, because that is the right and proper process; I agree that processes change over time&#151;indeed, the code of practice has been updated to reflect changes in thinking&#151;but I would not want to give the individual Minister the right to disagree with the principles and do something different, and the amendment provides the potential to achieve that.</p>

In their response to the Joint Committee, the Government said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="07010978000049"></a>&#147;The Government agrees that the intention of the Legal Services Board should be to work in partnership with the authorised regulators, leaving them with the responsibility for day to day regulation. The Legal Services Board should exercise its powers only where approved regulators are clearly failing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010978000037"></a>The wording of the amendment flows from that initial view of the Joint Committee, subsequently endorsed by the Government in their response.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07010978000004"></a>Behind the amendment is the fact that the Bill appears to say nothing about the way in which the Legal Services Board should approach its task. But from what the Government have been saying about the Bill as we have moved towards the parliamentary stage, it seems clear&#151;to me, at any rate&#151;that the existing professional bodies should act as the frontline regulators and the Legal Services Board should act in a supervisory role, intervening only if it believes that a frontline regulator is failing in some way or another to fulfil its task. The amendment seeks to reflect that in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07010978000005"></a>In the absence of this amendment, or one like it, in our view the Bill will fail to reflect the balance that the Government say they want to achieve between the frontline regulator doing the hands-on work and the Legal Services Board acting in an overseeing role, intervening only when the frontline regulator fails to fulfil its task. I readily accept that the noble Baroness may feel that an amendment differently worded would better reflect the balance of power between the Legal Services Board and the frontline regulators. I should be perfectly happy to consider&#151;indeed, I would probably accept&#151;any such amendment. I am extremely anxious to hear from the noble Baroness, first, whether she agrees with my interpretation of the relationship between the two and, secondly, whether she is prepared to endorse what the Government said in their response to the Joint Committee or some other form of words which would equally reflect the Government&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>

It provides a way of ensuring that the Legal Services Board will act with a light touch. It would be extremely unfortunate if a Legal Services Board decided to interfere directly and to constantly make directions and orders and so on to the Law Society, the Bar Council and any other regulatory bodies in such a way as to take over their functions. To us, the idea of acting in partnership is to be commended, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</p>

We spent some time in the Joint Committee talking about the phrase just used by the noble Lord: &#147;light touch&#148;. We heard that phrase on many occasions. I recall with a fond memory that, when my  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_175"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble friend and I were in harness together on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, we heard constant reiteration of the words &#147;light touch&#148;. Indeed, that has been the principle behind the way in which the Financial Services Authority and its leaders have sought to conduct regulation.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07010978000008"></a>It is very interesting to hear those who are subjected to statutory regulation by the FSA talk about light touch in theory but heavy bureaucracy in practice. Often the engine room will listen to its leadership but will resort to what is called the &#147;box-ticking phenomenon&#148;, in which one suddenly finds oneself enmeshed in a bureaucratic nightmare of regulation. I am sure that the Minister will say that that is far from the intention in setting up the Legal Services Board. Indeed, when the Joint Committee made this recommendation, which has given rise to the amendment, it said that it wanted to accept the Government&#146;s policy that lead responsibility should rest with the approved regulators.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07010978000009"></a>Against that background, we sought to put forward this idea of partnership. The term &#147;partnership&#148; is readily understood: the regulating bodies should act in harness, and the lead regulator should not interfere in a micro-management sense and certainly should not intervene unless there is clear evidence that the approved regulators are failing. In addition, not only should there be clear evidence that they are failing but their failures should have been brought to their notice and directions should have been issued with which they neglected to comply.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07010978000010"></a>So we are really talking about finding words that will express &#147;light touch&#148; in simple phraseology, and I cannot think of anything better than &#147;act in partnership&#148;, unless the Minister can suggest some other words. Certainly, this is very much in line with government policy and all the words that we have heard about light touch. Here is an opportunity for the noble Baroness to do what we have not paid sufficient tribute to her for doing already&#151;that is, to accept amendments. The Minister set a marvellous example to all her ministerial colleagues in listening to the argument and suddenly deciding, &#147;Yes, I will accept&#148;. If one is allowed to refer to the Box and the noble Baroness&#146;s advisers, I saw a sign of shocked silence when she accepted the previous set of amendments. I am not saying that they were caught by surprise but they just looked surprised. Please may they look surprised yet again by the noble Baroness accepting this amendment.</p>

We&#146;ve taken a position and that is how we are acting&#148;. Having said that, I think that this is the best job that one can make of &#147;light touch&#148;.</p>

She was keen to get rid of overused words such as &#147;light touch&#148;. Certainly, in my experience over many years, &#147;partnership&#148; is another of those words that are difficult to define. We all know what we mean, but if we are to include it in the legislation as a duty on the Legal Services Board, we have to be very clear about what we mean.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07010978000013"></a>I say at the outset that I completely accept the principle that says, &#147;We are creating a regulatory regime in which different people perform different functions and work cohesively together&#148;. In a sense, that is one definition of &#147;partnership&#148;. I have no objection to being very clear that we want the Legal Services Board and the frontline regulators, if they do not mind me calling them that, to be able to work together consistently. We have had some very useful discussions&#151;for example, yesterday with the Law Society&#151;about how rules are dealt with, which I am keen to pursue. I intend to talk to colleagues about that this week.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07010978000014"></a>In principle, I have no objection to this at all. I am not keen to put a duty of partnership on the Legal Services Board without a clear definition of what we mean. The noble Lord, Lord Neill, has raised an additional problem that we would have to think about. But I cannot accept the amendment, and I hope that the noble Lord will not refer again to things I do when I should not do them, as I will end up with no job if I am not careful. Perhaps we can try to be explicit about what we mean, which may be more about what I say rather than what we put in to the Bill, to be fair. We have no difficulties about putting out some specific points. I have said to the leadership in the professions, particularly in the Law Society and the Bar Council, although not exclusively to them, that I am very keen and happy for useful things to be said during the passage of the Bill so that matters can be made clear, although we cannot include them in the Bill as they would change the legislation. I hope we can have those discussions so we can be sure that we have clarified matters.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07010978000015"></a>I agree with the principle of working together in a regulatory regime and of ensuring that the Legal Services Board works effectively with those organisations. But I am not sure about a duty of partnership in statute, because I think that that is different. I am keen to make matters as clear as possible and to consider other options, especially for the future.</p>

<p><a name="07010978000039"></a>but in Amendment No. 32 we ask her to remove that expression from Clause 3. As I hope will become clear, our approach is wholly rational in relation to both amendments.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07010978000020"></a>Amendment No. 32 refers to Clause 3, which concerns the Legal Services Board&#146;s duty to promote the regulatory objectives set out in Clause 1(1). Clause 3(2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="07010978000051"></a>&#147;The Board must, so far as is reasonably practicable, act in a way&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07010978000052"></a>&#147;(a) which is compatible with the regulatory objectives, and</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="07010978000053"></a>&#147;(b) which the Board considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those objectives&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010978000040"></a>Our submission is that if one expunges the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="07010978000056"></a>&#147;so far as is reasonably practicable&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010978000041"></a>from Clause 3(2), the Government will still get exactly what they want from the clause. We believe that the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="07010978000057"></a>&#147;so far as is reasonably practicable&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010978000042"></a>unnecessarily qualifies Clause 1(1). What is the point of setting out the regulatory objectives in Clause 1(1) if one does not require the board to respect them in Clause 3(2)? If the expression is left in the clause, clearly one removes the obligation, in some circumstances, for the board to act in accordance with the regulatory objectives.</p>

<a name="70109-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07010978000021"></a>I believe that Clause 3(2)(b) fulfils exactly what the Government ought to want from the clause. The board ought to respect the regulatory objectives, but equally it ought to have the discretion to determine the most appropriate manner for meeting those objectives. As long as the board has discretion to determine the way in which an objective is met, surely that is sufficient. Surely in those circumstances the board can meet its obligation to meet the objective if it has the flexibility to decide the manner in which the objective is met.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I had a brief conversation about this earlier and I have received legal advice. He reasonably pointed out how Clause 3(2)(b) is drafted and said that, by removing the phrase, I would not be creating the problem I feared. I was fearful that the amendment would place an obligation on the board and on regulators to act in a way that was compatible with all of the regulatory objectives all of the time. That is obviously contrary to the principles proposed by Sir David Clementi which we discussed in part earlier this evening regarding the ability of regulators to judge for themselves how to balance one objective against another on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07010978000026"></a>In the Bill there may be tensions between some of the objectives in some circumstances. A case may arise in future where the objective to improve access to justice is more important, as we discussed on the competition issue, than the objective to promote competition. In such a situation it would be difficult for the Legal Services Board to comply fully with both regulatory objectives. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will agree that in our earlier discussion, when we considered the matter, he thought that Clause 3(2)(b) addressed the issue and that we did not need to look at it again. However, I have now taken advice from lawyers in the department. I shall not read out the advice in detail but will send it to Members of the Committee who have spoken in the debate so that they can look at it properly.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07010978000027"></a>We do not think that the effect that the noble Lord seeks will be achieved. The problem that I have outlined would be created because of the way in which the Bill is drafted. The result would be that the LSB would have to act in a way that is compatible with the regulatory objectives and that the board considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those objectives. &#147;So far as is reasonably practicable&#148; qualifies both of those. They require different things that would be differently affected by no longer being qualified by &#147;so far as is reasonably practicable&#148;.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07010978000028"></a>I shall stop there. However, that is the difficulty. The phrase is qualifying both, but in different ways. We shall discuss the point between now and Report to ensure that I have made that as clear as possible. I understand what the noble Lord seeks to do, but we need the provision in the clause in order to prevent the effect that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would accidentally achieve.</p>

I accept that there may be difficulties with my crafting of the amendment; but if the government lawyers say that it does not achieve the result I want, that still leaves us with the problem. The expression &#147;so far as is reasonably practicable&#148; leaves it open to the Legal Services Board to effectively ignore one or other of the objectives in making its decision. That would not be acceptable. So if our amendment does not achieve the objective we wish, we must find some other way of doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07010978000030"></a>Nor is it in the Government&#146;s interest that the Legal Services Board should effectively be able to make a decision by ignoring one of the objectives it is obliged to take into account under the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07010985000005"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, secondary legislation is supposed to be non-controversial, but these regulations could not be more controversial. It cannot be often that a set of regulations is accused of  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_180"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attacking fundamental religious freedoms. Yet, that is what is being said here. The newspapers in Northern Ireland are full of controversy about the regulations. The High Court has granted permission for a judicial review of the regulations, and there is even a public demonstration against them outside Parliament as we speak tonight.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07010985000006"></a>Noble Lords will know that the Merits Committee drew the special attention of the House to the regulations in its third report on 7 December. The committee made particular reference to the controversy. It pointed out that 290 of the 373 consultation responses that the Government received on the regulations expressed concern about the effect on religious liberty. The committee thinks that the House will be interested in,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000169"></a>&#147;the manner in which the Department have sought to allay the concerns which have been expressed by consultation respondents&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000147"></a>The fact is that they have failed to allay those concerns, as I will show.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07010985000007"></a>Noble Lords may have realised that we do not have the benefit today of a report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. That is not because the committee is unconcerned&#151;quite the contrary. I understand that the committee has asked the Government a series of searching questions about the regulations and has drawn attention to typographical errors. They have even asked whether the regulations are ultra vires under Section 24 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which prohibits Ministers from any action that breaches freedom of religion. I asked the Government to delay today&#146;s debate to allow the committee to complete its report, but my request was denied.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07010985000008"></a>What do the regulations do? The sexual orientation regulations, which came into force on 1 January, cover the provision of goods, facilities and services, education, public authorities and the disposal of property. The regulations outlaw, first, discrimination and, secondly, harassment on the ground of sexual orientation. The scope of the regulations is vast, covering businesses and voluntary organisations. The phrase &#147;goods, facilities and services&#148; is very broad, covering many different activities. The regulations do not cover employment, which is dealt with in other legislation.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07010985000009"></a>In most circumstances, the new laws will not be problematic. Homosexual people are entitled to be able to buy their groceries and have their bins emptied, just like everyone else&#151;but the regulations go much further. They make it possible for homosexual activists to sue people who disagree with a homosexual lifestyle because of their religious beliefs. Bed and breakfast owners and Christian old people&#146;s homes will be sued for not giving a double bed to homosexual civil partners. Wedding photographers will be made to pay compensation for not taking bookings for civil partnership ceremonies. Christians in business could even be sued for sharing their faith with customers. Worst of all, they require religious organisations to choose between obedience to God and obedience to the state.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07010985000010"></a>The press is reporting that a first breach of the law could incur fines of between &#163;500 and &#163;5,000. Subsequent serious breaches could attract damages of up to &#163;25,000. Regulation 3(3) sets out the new harassment law. The  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>law is breached if someone can show that their dignity has been violated or that someone has created an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. At its lowest, &#147;harassment&#148; can constitute an &#147;offensive environment&#148; for a homosexual. Noble Lords should note that Regulation 3(4) makes it clear that the court must have particular regard to the perception of the complainant. Furthermore, under Regulation 52, the burden of proof is reversed so that the person accused of harassment will have to prove their innocence.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07010985000011"></a>The Government&#146;s Equality Bill proposed the creation of a harassment law in almost exactly the same terms as that, but on the ground of religion. In November 2005, this House voted to remove it from the Bill. It was considered too broad, too controversial and a threat to freedom of speech. The Government responded by asking the discrimination law review to look at it. That review has not yet reported. No solution has yet been put forward by the many experts involved in that review. Yet the Northern Ireland Office seems to think that it has the wisdom of Solomon and has slipped in the harassment provisions. It has done so despite indicating in its consultation paper that it was not minded to do so. I should say that the consultation itself was defective in that it did not give enough time for members of the public to respond and ignored most of the responses.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07010985000012"></a>Furthermore, the Government claim that concerns about religious liberty are met by Regulation 16. It provides certain exemptions for religious organisations from a discrimination law. I underline this: what it does not do is protect religious organisations from the harassment law. That has major implications for religious liberty and freedom of speech. For example, if church membership were denied to a homosexual and the minister explained in orthodox, theological terms the religious belief that justified the denial, it would be open to the person to bring a claim for harassment. He could complain that the explanation had the effect of,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000170"></a>&#147;violating ... dignity; or creating an intimidating ... humiliating or offensive environment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000148"></a>Regulation 16(4)(a) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="07010985000160"></a>&#147;Nothing in these Regulations shall make it unlawful for a minister to restrict participation in activities carried on in the performance of his functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000149"></a>That exemption covers the refusal by the minister. It does not cover any subsequent explanations. If he quotes from the Bible, he could be in trouble. What could be more fundamental than the right to decide who is a member of your church? Yet that is jeopardised by the regulations.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07010985000013"></a>As I mentioned, the regulations are subject to judicial review by several Christian groups. The Christian Institute and six denominations have successfully applied for permission for a judicial review that is to be heard in early March. They are represented by James Dingemans QC who argues that the regulations interfere with the manifestation of religious belief and bring about a situation where one set of rights trumps another.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07010985000014"></a>One might have hoped for some humility from Government in the face of these allegations, some willingness to reconsider. Instead, Ministers have been engaged in knocking down straw men. I have here a letter dated 13 December from Mr David Hanson, the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, which says that bed and breakfast places can still refuse to give a double bed to a homosexual couple so long as they also refuse double beds to unmarried heterosexual couples, but what about the issue of civil partnerships? The consultation paper repeatedly declared the Government&#146;s intention to ensure that civil partners receive the same treatment as married couples. So, if a Christian bed and breakfast establishment refused a double room to a homosexual couple living in a civil partnership, they could be sued and so in effect closed down purely because of their religious beliefs.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07010985000015"></a>The Minister also says that the harassment provisions will not stop a Christian bookshop promoting marriage. That is very good. But what he does not say is what happens when members of staff in a Christian bookshop share the Gospel with a homosexual customer. If they urge the customer to repent and turn to Christ&#151;as in Northern Ireland they might often do&#151;they could easily find themselves on the wrong end of a legal action for harassment. The bookshop would not want to discriminate in any way&#151;it would happily sell the person, sell anyone, a book&#151;but it can still be sued for harassment.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07010985000016"></a>Education will also be affected. The Minister says that the regulations apply only to access to benefits and not the curriculum. I believe that he is mistaken. There is absolutely nothing in the wording that excludes the curriculum from the scope of litigation.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07010985000017"></a>In Northern Ireland, the Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998 outlaws discrimination on the ground of religion in the provision of goods and services. It provides broad exceptions for schools which could cover the curriculum. This means that it will not be possible to litigate using these laws over any religious content in the school curriculum. However, the sexual orientation regulations do not exempt the curriculum. That creates an imbalance in legal rights. Discrimination law could be used to promote homosexuality but not to object to it. A pupil who identifies as homosexual can sue a teacher who says in an RE lesson that sex outside of marriage is wrong, but a religious pupil cannot sue if homosexuality is promoted in an English lesson.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07010985000018"></a>There is another glaring hole in the exceptions for religious groups. Regulation 16(8) states that the exception does not apply where an organisation contracts with the state to provide a particular service. This means that religious bodies providing a service on behalf of the state must fully comply with the new laws. So a Christian old people&#146;s home receiving state funding for some places which refused a double room to two civil partners would be unlawfully discriminating. The home is faced with a choice: defend legal actions or turn down state funding. Either way, the costs would mean that the home will close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07010985000019"></a>In a recent letter to <I>The Times</I> dated 30 November 2006, Meg Munn MP claims that the sexual orientation regulations are necessary as,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000171"></a>&#147;lesbian or bisexual people are denied access to essential healthcare&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000150"></a>If that indeed were the case, this sort of discrimination could be dealt with easily under current guidance by the General Medical Council without the need to have SORs implemented. Those who work in the NHS inform me that they are not aware of any incidents of lesbians or bisexuals being denied access to essential healthcare. Recently, the Equality Unit, DTI, was contacted but was unable to provide substantial evidence regarding this. There appears to be only very limited anecdotal evidence. I contend that the Government have failed to provide robust evidence to support the claim that homosexual individuals are denied access to essential healthcare. As that claim seems to be one of the main bases for introducing SORs, the burden of responsibility rests with the Minister to produce robust and convincing evidence that homosexual individuals are denied access to essential healthcare. It is most important that the Government ensure that the proposed SORs will not be abused by malicious claims as has happened in other countries. I give the example of Canada.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07010985000020"></a>I am firmly convinced that the freedom to manifest one&#146;s religion is seriously undermined. The regulations threaten to override the consciences and free speech of Christians and others who object to homosexual practice. This contravenes Articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the Government have achieved one thing: they have united Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter in opposition to these SORs. I am not aware of any&#151;I underline the word &#147;any&#148;&#151;church denomination, large or small, in Northern Ireland that supports the regulations. As a matter of fact, I confidently stand here tonight and tell noble Lords that there is none. Not a single denomination, small or large, in Northern Ireland supports these regulations. I beg to move.</p>

What I do not believe is that they have the right to put those beliefs into action in a way that affects adversely the life and livelihood of other human beings. These regulations very simply seek to prevent that.</p>

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07010985000025"></a>This is not just about freedom of conscience. It is about freedom of action and where the limits to that freedom of action have to rest in order to ensure that other people in our society can be properly protected. These regulations are very simply putting non-discrimination into practice. If in much of the material that has been written about these matters we had simply substituted the word &#147;black&#148; for the word &#147;homosexual&#148;, I wonder whether we would be giving house room to some of these arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07010985000026"></a>I speak as someone who happens to be a gay man. I also happen to be a Christian.

<a name="70109-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07010985000027"></a>There is an old story about a black man in the deep south of the United States who climbs up the steps of a church in order to go in and worship. He climbs up the steps on a very hot, sunny, summer afternoon. He gets to the door of the church and the burly man at the doors says, &#147;I&#146;m sorry. You can&#146;t come in here. It&#146;s not for the likes of you&#148;. Very sorrowfully, the black man turns round and walks back down the steps. Halfway down, God speaks to him and says, &#147;Why are you so sad?&#148;. He says, &#147;Well, Lord, I wanted to go into the church to worship you, and they won&#146;t let me in&#148;. &#147;It&#146;s all right&#148;, says God, &#147;I&#146;ve been trying to get in there for years, and they won&#146;t let me in either&#148;. It seems to me that perhaps some of those who are arguing against these regulations should reflect just a little on that story and on the lessons from it.</p>

As I see it, these regulations for Northern Ireland, dealing, as they do, with sexual orientation, differ considerably from any of the legislation outlawing discrimination on other grounds. Let me take a moment to explain why.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70109-0012.htm"/>


<a name="70109-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07010985000029"></a>The sexual orientation regulations are not confined in their effect to the tendency of a person&#151;orientation means, I think, tendency. These regulations are not about outlawing a particular tendency. They do more than that. They state that people who give services, supply goods or provide facilities must not discriminate on the ground of sexual orientation. The regulations imply that if those people interact with people of that orientation, they must also be prepared to allow them, if appropriate, to use the facilities that they provide for the purpose of homosexual practice. That is quite different from the other types of discrimination. It is the practice of homosexual acts that some Christians&#151;but not the noble Lord who has just spoken&#151;and considerable numbers of people of other major religions believe is wrong and sinful, and they do not think that they can conscientiously do anything to promote or further it.</p>

That is the difference between this type of regulation and the discrimination regulations with which we are familiar and which most, if not all, Christians and other religious people support wholeheartedly. These regulations are different in that respect. It is interesting to notice that the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee considered that there were difficult issues in these regulations that required the consideration of the House. I believe that that was because these regulations have a feature different from the regulations of former times to which we are accustomed.</p>

It is a tendency, not a practice. The difference between those regulations and these regulations is that these regulations, although they come under the heading of sexual orientation regulations, would make it unlawful for a person to refuse to accept a same-sex couple into their boarding house. I am much too old to offer any such facilities and the regulations are unlikely to affect me in any way whatever; I am thinking of a person who has a religious conviction of the kind that I have just mentioned and who does not believe that it is right in conscience to accept people into their house who would use it to practise a way of life that they considered sinful. That is the essence of the problem. The regulations seek to override their conscientious objection to that behaviour in their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07010985000033"></a>The adoption agencies are another area of difficulty. There may be a regulation that helps to exempt adoption agencies that are charities&#151;at least it does so on one construction of it&#151;but there is a difficulty if an adoption agency declines to place children with same-sex couples on the ground of religious conviction. Again, that might be outlawed by the regulations. The regulations are not particularly easy to construe and I am not going to attempt to do so, because they are quite complicated, but this is the essence of the matter as I see it&#151;differentiating these regulations and the kind with which we are familiar.</p>

Shortly before my retirement on 31 December as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, I found that it was my duty to join episcopal colleagues in drawing the attention of the general public to the tremendous concern that we as bishops felt about the manner in which the process of legislating in this place and in the other place for Northern Ireland was being followed. We had to make our concerns public for the simple reason that we believed that some of the process that was being adopted by Her Majesty&#146;s Government in relation to Northern Ireland was in every sense a denial of rights. This debate, while it has so far centred on doctrine and personal religious beliefs, is an example of what can happen when the Government follow a certain process through Orders in Council and regulations, as is the case this evening.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07010985000037"></a>What I am speaking of has nothing to with party politics or denominations. It is something that should be of genuine concern to this House, particularly to those who do not come from Northern Ireland, but who in England and Wales will shortly, so we are informed, have to engage in a debate of this nature.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07010985000038"></a>Over a wide range of subjects, not least this present one, current procedures place some of us in an impossible situation, where we agree with large sections of legislation&#151;where we agree with the spirit of it and recognise that it has to do with human dignity and equality&#151;but cannot do otherwise than challenge other parts of it. The process to which I am referring denies us the opportunity to do that. To support such proposals in total denies our rights to question or amend.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07010985000039"></a>I shall illustrate this dilemma, which I and others feel tonight, with reference to some current legislation that has, or will, come before this House. The main churches in Northern Ireland&#151;the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist churches&#151;received the consultation documentation on 29 July and a response was demanded by 25 September. Noble Lords will recognise that this was a major holiday period, when anything akin to a full response was impossible. If the views of the main churches were of interest to the Government and were genuinely sought on such an important and sensitive issue as this, which has to do with dignity, equality and justice, how were we expected to respond with integrity? Consequently, we find ourselves this evening supporting much, but unable to press our concerns on parts that are unclear and a source of deep anxiety to many Christians in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07010985000040"></a>Of equal importance to this concern on the consultative process on Orders in Council are the following examples. A huge document was received for consultation by the churches on charities review. Views were invited, we were told, on 7 July and expected by 13 October. On the adoption law, views  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were invited on 4 July and a response demanded by 1 September. A mammoth amount of paperwork on education was received on 28 November for a response by 19 January. In addition, at any one time, my colleagues and my staff were dealing with several such requests at the one time. How can those of us wishing to support fair and detailed analysis of important legislation, but who are confronted by such restricted timescales, convince people of the merits of good government?</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07010985000041"></a>As noble Lords know, unlike most legislation, neither Orders in Council nor regulations can be amended and they are denied full parliamentary scrutiny as I understand it. Surely where such situations arise there is an additional legal and moral burden on the Government to be seen to provide reasonable additional consultation, in the name of good government. In Northern Ireland, where the onus is placed on this House and the other place in the absence of a local Assembly, surely that moral responsibility is even more important. I believe that the Government should have instructed civil servants along those lines.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07010985000042"></a>It is also obvious that broadly similar legislation applying separately to Northern Ireland and to the rest of the United Kingdom is accorded different response times in different parts of the kingdom, to the disadvantage of the people of Northern Ireland. It prompts me to ask: what if the regulations proposed for England and Wales ultimately differ in any manner from those proposed for Northern Ireland? What will be the result for the United Kingdom as a whole? That is a very serious possibility, which I ask this House to take into consideration.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07010985000043"></a>The churches play a vital role in charities, adoption procedures, education and now equality issues. I believe that we do not have to defend the role that we have played or the voice that we have given to the population on these issues. These issues have an impact on the life of the voluntary sector and the wider community, and much of the legislation on those other areas is to be welcomed; equally, however, much of it is controversial and deserves much closer scrutiny than is possible under our present procedures.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07010985000044"></a>It gives me, after my years of public service, no pleasure to make those points. But I appeal to the Government to recognise the dilemmas that the current procedure presents to many of us, including myself. Should it be the case&#151;I say, should it be the case&#151;that fast-tracking controversial legislation is simply a lever to force the restoration of devolved government for Northern Ireland, I would have very serious concerns. Be that as it may, a serious consequence of the current methods of making law for Northern Ireland is to leave open the way for such perceptions to prosper. In my years of experience, if I have learnt anything, it is that&#151;I think that those noble Lords who have served in the Province would agree with me&#151;perceptions can become realities overnight. In the interests of good government, that is surely highly undesirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07010985000045"></a>This debate illustrates the consequences of that lack of scrutiny. It poses very serious issues, irrespective of the detail of the subject matter covered

I suggest that the way in which this is being done, in any democracy such as ours, poses very serious issues, and I for one felt bound to express those concerns to the House.</p>

I support the regulations, not because I support homosexuals and lesbians, or because I have no morals or Christian faith&#151;I hope that I have both&#151;but because I believe in equality. It is something that I have worked for all my life, whether in religion, colour, disability, gender or class, and I see no difference in affording the same equality in sexual orientation. There has been quite a lot of talk in Northern Ireland&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, has referred to it&#151;about bed and breakfast accommodation where two men or two women might share a bedroom, something that I have done numerous times. Having attended numerous conferences over the years, I have shared a bedroom with another woman, but I cannot remember ever being asked what I was going to do in the room.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07010985000047"></a>There is also the suggestion that, if these regulations were passed, it would be un-Christian and all Christian people in Northern Ireland would be outraged. But I have in my hand an article written by a Christian organisation whose headline is, &#147;New legislation not to be feared by Christians&#148;. Indeed, as any of your Lordships who were watching &#147;Heaven and Earth&#148; on television last Sunday will know, this legislation was one of the topics on the programme. Viewers were asked to e-mail and text in their views. The majority of viewers who responded were in favour of the legislation. So it is wide of the mark to suggest that all right-thinking people are opposed to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07010985000048"></a>I agree with the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, that there is a lot of uneasiness about the way that this is being done. But if you look at Northern Ireland, you think of the Equality Commission, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, Help the Aged and Age Concern, which all strongly support these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07010985000049"></a>Although I can cite all these organisations that support the legislation, there is a body of people who feel deeply offended by it and I support their right to oppose it. Across Northern Ireland, even among those who support the regulations, there is deep anger and a feeling of unease at the speed with which they are being put through. As we have heard, the consultation period was short and requests from groups for extensions were denied, even though that was granted in Great Britain. So it is easy to understand the feeling in Northern Ireland that the people there are being used as guinea pigs.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07010985000050"></a>Given the nature of the regulations, would not the Northern Ireland Office have been better advised to take more time over them? Indeed, could they not have been brought in at the same time as the legislation for Great Britain, which I understand is to be April 2007? This kind of consultation leaves Northern Ireland feeling insulted, not consulted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07010985000051"></a>I concede that the Government have taken on board some of the suggestions&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, referred to some of them&#151;that came out of the short consultation period and that some changes have been made and some safeguards have been put in. But I ask the Minister two questions. First, why was the consultation period shorter than the one in Great Britain? Secondly&#151;and the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, has already referred to this&#151;if and when the regulations for Great Britain come to be debated and they are amended or indeed not passed, where would that leave the regulations for Northern Ireland? Would they be withdrawn?</p>

They have been rushed through, after the briefest possible consultation during the summer holidays&#151;as the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, made clear in his deeply impressive speech&#151;and have been introduced under direct rule powers so that Northern Ireland&#146;s democratically elected representatives have had no opportunity to consider them. Had they done so, I should not have been surprised if Sinn Fein and the DUP had joined forces to oppose them.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07010985000053"></a>The regulations include a widely drawn harassment law, which my noble friend Lord Morrow has already described. He explained its implications, which would have been very serious. Those responsible for drawing it up might have remembered that a similar harassment law covering religion was rejected in a decisive vote by this House on the Third Reading of the Equality Bill last November on an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. Moreover there is, as I understand it, already a firm criminal law which protects everyone&#151;the Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07010985000054"></a>It is clear that the new regulations, while seeking quite reasonably to meet the concerns of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals, may have damaging effects on Christians and Christian churches of all denominations, Christian schools, Christian adoption agencies, Christian printers and Christian conference centres. They may be asked to provide services that involve them in condoning or promoting a lifestyle that conflicts with their fundamental beliefs about marriage and family life. It has been pointed out that the regulations may be used to discriminate against those who deeply believe that homosexual activity is morally wrong.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07010985000055"></a>It is not surprising that eminent churchmen&#151;both Catholics and Anglicans, including leaders of black churches&#151;have spoken out strongly against the regulations. The Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="07010985000161"></a>&#147;Those who are elected to fashion our laws are not elected to be our moral tutors. They have no mandate or competence to do so&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000151"></a>Jews and Muslims seem to be equally concerned.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07010985000056"></a>The regulations will certainly have an adverse effect on freedom of speech. A Christian teacher would, it appears, risk prosecution if he or she were to teach

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07010985000058"></a>I have for some time thought that a substantial proportion of the laws that we in this House are asked to pass result from pressure from the homosexual lobby, while other minorities are ignored. For example, nine years ago, the Government commissioned a study of salmon and freshwater fisheries. An excellent report resulted that was welcomed by everyone, including the Government. The recommendations for actions by fishery organisations were quickly followed up. The Government promised to introduce primary legislation to deal with the rest when parliamentary time permitted. That was six years ago and nothing has happened, but year after year the Government reaffirmed their commitment to legislate. A rather sad letter that Defra sent to all the organisations concerned just a year ago states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="07010985000162"></a>&#147;Although we have bid for a Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Bill in most years since the review ... we have never been successful in getting a slot for it. For the current session, it made the reserve list (albeit at No. 47) but was eventually dropped because of pressure of other government business&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000152"></a>A year later, there is still no sign of the Bill. Now, too, we see that the marine Bill&#151;something of the greatest importance to this country&#151;did not as expected make it into the Queen&#146;s Speech. Perhaps it, too, will suffer prolonged delay.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07010985000059"></a>Three and a half million anglers and uncounted environmentalists are given short shrift by this Government, but things are very different when the Government deal with the gay lobby. I asked the Library how many major statutes impacting on gay rights have passed since 1997. It gave me a list of eight. Lesbians, gay men and bisexuals have indeed been handsomely treated at the cost of other interests. There have been so many of these Bills that the Government seem now to have decided to take major steps to increase gay rights by avoiding primary legislation and using regulations like those now before us as a quicker and less difficult alternative.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07010985000060"></a>Not only do Ministers such as Mr Hain push on this agenda; even civil servants are drawn into the campaign. A recent report says that proposals by officials in the Home Office&#151;where else?&#151;recommends that schools that lack enthusiasm for rooting out &#147;homophobic&#148; prejudice should be reported to the police, that there should be &#147;hate crime co-ordinators&#148; and that gay lobby groups should set up third-party reporting centres, seemingly a resurrection of the &#147;Cooper&#146;s snoopers&#148; we heard of during the war.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07010985000061"></a>One is bound to ask oneself why this Government are apparently so obsessed with extending the rights and privileges of gays. People may begin to wonder if they are planning to make homosexuality compulsory. This never-ending stream of measures for a particular lobby is surely likely to produce a backlash and make life for gays worse rather than better.</p>

I must tell him that, should he come one dark and stormy evening knocking at the door of my house seeking shelter, he would be most welcome. He would be most civilly invited in and I hope that we would enjoy each other's company, because this is not quite as he would have us believe. He put the proposition that we should think about this legislation substituting the word &#147;black&#148; for &#147;homosexual&#148;. Of course, that sounds an interesting proposition, but I have to point out that &#147;black&#148; is about being. Sexual orientation is also about being. We would not wish to discriminate against people for being black or on grounds of their sexual orientation. The concerns being expressed this evening are primarily about sodomy rather than about sexual orientation&#151;that is, doing not being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07010985000064"></a>As an old politician who likes to think he had reasonable experience in government, I cannot think of a single word to add from the point of view of good government to what has been said by the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames. He said it in a way which should be a lesson to all of us who practise, have practised or will in future practise the arts of government.</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07010985000065"></a>Some things about this legislation give me concern. First, there is the question of those exemptions which are granted. In shorthand, one could say that to qualify for these exemptions one would need to establish that one had, or belonged to a group which had, a profound religious objection to some of these matters. What has happened to liberal values? Why is a thoughtful agnostic or atheist to be compelled to do that to which these regulations would give thoughtful deists a waiver? Is that not itself a prime example of discrimination?</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07010985000066"></a>Perhaps we should have some legislation to protect those who are not deists in the way protection is being given to those who are of a religious frame of mind. Is it not possible for such a person to hold the view that it is wrong for the state to compel him to refrain from arguing that sodomy is a social ill or to conscript him or his children into aiding and abetting it&#151;if that is the right expression? Is it not possible for a person without religious beliefs to reasonably hold the view that it is wrong for the state to compel him to refrain from making arguments which he could make were he a member of a religious group?</p>

<a name="70109-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07010985000067"></a>I have other questions. I take it that it will be the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who gets the short straw again tonight in answering the debate. Would, let us say, a woman patient in a hospital who declined to be treated or examined by an openly lesbian doctor be guilty of harassment? Could she be sued for such a thing, particularly if she had no religious beliefs about it, merely personal ones?</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_spopq0"></a><a name="07010985000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, recently tabled some Questions for Written Answer. He asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="07010985000163"></a>&#147;Whether the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 would require a family-run bed and breakfast to let out a double room to a transsexual couple, even if the family consider it to be in the best interests of their children to refuse to allow such a situation in their own home&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/06; col. <I>WA</I><I>198</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000153"></a>The reply from the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, was brief and to the point: &#147;No&#148;. However, paragraph 7.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="07010985000164"></a>&#147;The Regulations will also impact on hotel and bed and breakfast owners, who will not be able to deny a same sex couple accommodation on the basis of their sexual orientation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000154"></a>Which is correct, the answer &#147;no&#148; or the explanation in the Explanatory Memorandum?</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07010985000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, also asked whether the regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000172"></a>&#147;would require all schools actively to promote homosexual civil partnerships to children from primary school age to the same degree that they teach the importance of marriage&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000070"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="07010985000165"></a>&#147;No ... That is rightly a matter for the Department of Education, Northern Ireland&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/06; col. <I>WA 198</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000155"></a>That is one of the nicest passes, although I think perhaps a forward pass, that I have seen anywhere this side of Twickenham.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07010985000156"></a>Surely the truth of the matter is that these regulations do not so much prohibit or require that certain things should or should not be done but provide a route by which aggrieved parties may seek legal redress if another party should do or fail to do certain things. It is rather akin to the position that would occur if I should be so foolish as to libel the noble Lord, Lord Lester. He would be able to seek redress swiftly in the courts.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07010985000071"></a>Just as the laws of libel are sometimes used by the rich and powerful to intimidate into silence their less rich and powerful critics, so these regulations would leave perfectly innocent people in fear of legal action by the fanatical wings of the lesbian and gay pressure groups. Whatever the intention of those who drafted the regulations, they are bound to create not only a shadow or umbra of prohibitions but a vastly wider penumbra of the fear of prosecution.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07010985000072"></a>We have only to reflect on the fear of the Derbyshire police recently that they might lay themselves open to action under the Human Rights Act should they publish photographs of two murderers who had walked out of prison and the later confident assertion of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that there was no such risk. When we think about that, we realise the climate of fear that can be created by legislation of the sort that we are discussing today. After all, the Derbyshire police presumably have access to better legal advice than the unfortunate proprietor of a bed and breakfast establishment in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07010985000073"></a>For those reasons, I am left full of disquiet about the nature of the regulations as well as full of very strong views on the manner in which this legislation is

Does he take the view that that whole body of legislation should be repealed on the ground that it would be coercive and intimidatory to those who practise discrimination, or is it only homosexuals that he would deprive of relief?</p>

<a name="07010985000075"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010985000197"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is again going off on a wrong track. This is about the requirement for, for example, a bed and breakfast establishment proprietor to facilitate the act of sodomy. It is not about discrimination against a homosexual couple. That is the point of which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has uncharacteristically lost sight.</p>

<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="07010985000076"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010985000198"></a>Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</b> My Lords, I find it difficult to understand the point that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, is making and I should be grateful if he could elucidate on it further. He seems to repeat the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, that somehow or other it would be improper to discriminate against someone on the ground of orientation but proper to discriminate on the ground of action. Surely the whole basis of our law is that you do not discriminate against people on the ground of action, provided that that action is legal, which in this case it is. So I cannot see the difference.</p>

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="07010985000077"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010985000199"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> My Lords, let me put it another way for the noble Lord. He is supporting legislation tonight that would make it possible for two young men&#151;chavs, shall we call them perhaps&#151;to go with their girlfriends into a gay bar and then claim that they had been discriminated against or humiliated by the remarks or behaviour of people in that gay bar. Is that what we want to come out of this? It is not what I want to come out of this, but that is what will be the effect of it and that is why I object to it.</p>

This is not about attitudes; this is about the process, and the process we are going through tonight is even more unique than normal. What is the effect of an order in Northern Ireland, followed by a Bill for the remainder of the United Kingdom? Normally orders in Northern Ireland are either unique to Northern Ireland or they follow legislation in the remainder of the United Kingdom. This process is unique in a different way, in supporting an order that came in on 1 January, because the order is already in place, written on the Government&#146;s instructions, without amendment and without consultation. We have in place an order  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that will be followed by a Bill&#151;which may be introduced in another place first&#151;that is extremely unlikely not to be amended on its way through. That is what is wrong as far as Northern Ireland is concerned. We will have in place an order that is substantially different from that in the remainder of the United Kingdom. There is no question about it. If this and another place do their job there is bound to be some amendment, purely to its written English if nothing else.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07010985000079"></a>We have heard about guest houses. I am, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, put it, the &#147;unfortunate proprietor&#148; of a guest house in Northern Ireland&#151;though I do not think that I am unfortunate. I have had a few noble Lords to stay and I quite enjoyed it; whether they did is another matter. Please note that I do not have children and we are not&#151;and here I shall be accused of discrimination&#151;a very children-friendly place because we do not have a nursery or children&#146;s toys. The point is this: a guest house is not a hotel; nor is it the local ironmonger&#146;s or a travel agency. It is a place to which people go&#151;very often as couples&#151;to get away for a happy weekend together.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07010985000080"></a>More than anything, a guest house is unique because it involves the guests in the family. They are not in room 214 where they can press a button&#151;if they did so at Colebrook they would not get anything. They are among the family. If there are children, they can talk to the children. They may even have children as guests themselves and will involve themselves with those children. It may not be the religious belief of people who own guest houses, but purely their determination, that their children may grow up to be able to make a decision on whether they are influenced by activities of which their parents do not necessarily approve. This is absolutely vital.</p>

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="07010985000081"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010985000201"></a>Lord Alli:</b> My Lords, would the noble Lord answer two questions for me? Would he allow me to stay in his guest house on the basis of my colour? And would he allow me and my partner to stay in his guest house on the basis of our sexual orientation?</p>

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="07010985000082"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07010985000202"></a>Viscount Brookeborough:</b> My Lords, I would be delighted for the noble Lord to stay on the basis of both his colour and his sexual orientation. There is absolutely no question about it. Please do come and stay and I will charge you appropriately. It will be precisely the same as for everybody else, I assure you. However, this is not about that. This is about having people among your family. That is the important thing. I accept entirely what the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, said about her working stays in guest houses. I suggest that she and her roommate would not normally carry on throughout the day the way that a couple would if they were away for a very special weekend alone. That is slightly different, but I accept that it may, under certain circumstances, happen, and it has happened in our house.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07010985000083"></a>I am going to finish now. First, however, this is unique to Northern Ireland not only because it is an Order in Council; it is unique because it is being done prior to other legislation coming into effect in   


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_195"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>England. Secondly, the Government are introducing into a family something from which it is surely the right of the parents to protect their children until they are at an age at which they can decide for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="07010985000084"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07010985000203"></a>The Lord Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham:</b> My Lords, I would like to pick up on some of the scenes that I have heard this evening in the Chamber, and particularly I refer to the earlier scenes enunciated by the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames. The regulations do not apply to England. The Church of England has already submitted its views on the important points that need to be safeguarded in the parallel regulations for Great Britain. We very much welcome the time and the trouble that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is taking to consider all the representations that she has received.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07010985000085"></a>The regulations might have been a great deal more satisfactory if Ministers and officials in Northern Ireland had also taken more time to engage in detail with the churches and others there about them. As a result, we find ourselves having to consider regulations that, while in some respects perfectly sensible, are in other respects unclear and cause a deep anxiety&#151;and surely that anxiety is patently obvious to anyone who is listening&#151;to Christians and other people of faith.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07010985000086"></a>For example, when Parliament has no opportunity to make amendments, it frankly beggars belief that provisions on harassment were inserted at the last minute and without warning. It is not enough to say that harassment is a bad thing, which manifestly it is. The question is how to avoid making any new provisions so subjective that they act as a curb on the legitimate expression of opinion to which others take offence. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister why it has been thought necessary to proceed with such haste in one part of the United Kingdom when the Government&#146;s sensible decision for elsewhere has been to study the matter at greater length as part of the discrimination law review.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07010985000087"></a>The regulations clearly demonstrate the need to strike a fair balance between the rights of homosexual people to be treated with dignity and respect and the rights of Christians and other people of faith to manifest their religious beliefs, including those in relation to sexual conduct. In the view of a number of us on these Benches, these hastily prepared regulations fail to do that. Instead, they run the risk of facing significant numbers of people, as we have heard earlier in the debate, with the choice between complying with the law or with their religiously informed conscience. Whether that is the intention of the Secretary of State, or simply the unintended consequence of regulations produced with inadequate consultation, is unclear. But it causes many of us great concern.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07010985000088"></a>The Government have, of course, sought to be helpful by including a set of special provisions for churches and other religious organisations in Regulation 16. Most Christian denominations and other faiths are not able in good conscience to make their places of worship available to those who wish, for example, to  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_196"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have their same-sex relationships or partnerships blessed and celebrated. Nor are they willing to make their church halls available to organisations that seek to promote the acceptance of homosexual relationships as equivalent to heterosexual ones. Nor can many Christians accept that children in church schools should be taught that same-sex relationships are just as valid as heterosexual relationships based on marriage.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07010985000089"></a>The intention behind Regulation 16 is therefore helpful, but it appears to permit restrictions only if imposed,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000173"></a>&#147;in respect of a person on the ground of his sexual orientation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000157"></a>All the mainstream Christian churches are clear that they have no wish to impose restrictions on the ground of sexual orientation as opposed to conduct. That being so, it is far from clear that the varied restrictions that religious organisations might wish to impose&#151;namely, on the basis of homosexual conduct&#151;would in fact be protected. It would also be helpful to have the Minister&#146;s confirmation that they are intended to be.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07010985000090"></a>Also of concern, in terms of exceptions, is what is expressly left out. Regulation 11 imposes a very wide general duty on educational establishments, and yet there is no special provision for faith schools. No one would seek to argue for an exemption in relation, for example, to admissions policies, but what about the teaching in relation to marriage? Whether in the classroom or in the context of collective worship, is a Roman Catholic school that teaches children the traditional Catholic view to be at risk of legal challenge? If that is not the Government&#146;s intention, the regulation should have made that position clearer. The potential for bringing such claims risks putting schools in an unnecessarily difficult position. There is absolutely no case for this when in practice the whole area of sex and relationship education is being handled sensitively in faith schools within the present, very carefully balanced statutory framework. In the regulations for Great Britain, it is important that this matter is put beyond doubt. In the mean time, I can only express very real concern that the regulations for Northern Ireland do not deal with this matter satisfactorily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07010985000091"></a>In conclusion, there is much in these regulations that is uncontentious and a very proper protection against injustice, but overall they fail to strike that careful balance, which Parliament has been historically good at striking, that is needed particularly in areas where conflicting rights are engaged. They have all the hallmarks of haste and insufficient engagement, both at policy level and on detailed drafting with the churches. Whatever the outcome of tonight&#146;s debate, it is crucial that the serious issues raised by Christian and other religious leaders are adequately dealt with before the regulations for the rest of the United Kingdom are finalised.</p>

I think perhaps tonight I understand why. It is very good to see the interest being taken tonight. I will be very brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07010985000093"></a>I have had from Stonewall two examples which may help your Lordships make up your minds about which way you will vote. One gay couple from Northern Ireland wrote to Stonewall recently saying why they were turned away late at night from a country hotel which they had booked months before in order to attend a sister&#146;s wedding. They found the experience utterly humiliating. Stonewall also says that it heard from a woman who went to see her GP, having suffered from work-related stress. When the woman mentioned her lesbian partner in conversation, she was told that she was engaging in unnatural, inhuman practices and that it was none too surprising that she would be suffering from mental distress as a consequence. The unnatural, inhuman practices were being perpetrated by the GP. It deeply saddens me to have to say that. It is essential that these regulations are accepted  by Parliament and that Northern Ireland should lead the way towards a tolerant, caring and humane society.</p>

Surely it would have been better to await the outcome of that review, fixed for 1 and 2 March, instead of charging blindly on.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07010985000095"></a>I am also surprised that we have been required to debate these regulations today before the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has been able to produce its report. Given that it clearly has questions about the regulations, surely it would have been better if we had waited a couple of weeks for that report.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07010985000096"></a>The Merits Committee has expressed a certain amount of doubt, and the Joint Committee could have shed further light on the comments of the Merits Committee, but we have been deprived of that light by the Government&#146;s indecent haste to get this debate out of the way. One of the members of that committee, Mr David Simpson MP, has said publicly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="07010985000166"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s timetabling makes a mockery of the parliamentary process. How are MPs supposed to make an informed decision about Sexual Orientation Regulations before the committee has had a chance to report? We have serious questions about how the regulations could interfere with religious liberty under the Human Rights Act. Peter Hain is rushing these regulations onto the statute book and seems prepared to sideline the parliamentary process in order to do so&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07010985000097"></a>It is quite clear that throughout this whole process the Government have been prepared to ride roughshod over everybody. As the noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, and others have noted, the consultation timetable was quite unacceptable&#151;a period of eight weeks which included the entire month of August, the main holiday season in Northern Ireland, therefore in effect four weeks. The Government&#146;s own guidelines state that public consultation should be held over a standard minimum period of 12 weeks&#151;not four weeks. In the rest of the United Kingdom, the consultation lasted 12 weeks, from 13 March to 5 June 2006. Why was Northern Ireland&#146;s consultation in effect one third of that?</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07010985000098"></a>The regulations were made on 8 November 2006, just six weeks and two days after the public consultation closed on 25 September. Do the Government really expect us to believe that six weeks and two days is long enough to consider the 373 responses and to address the complex issues raised?</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07010985000099"></a>In the rest of the United Kingdom, the making of the regulations has been postponed while issues raised during the public consultation are being addressed. The Government have postponed the implementation of the regulations on the mainland until April 2007. Their consultation ended three and a half months before that of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07010985000100"></a>Let us presume that the regulations will be made around mid-February. That constitutes 250 days between the end of the consultation and the making of the regulations, compared with 44 days in Northern Ireland. How does that stack up? It is an insult to Northern Ireland that the time between the end of the consultation and the making of the regulations is around one-fifth of that in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07010985000101"></a>The right honourable Ruth Kelly was emphatic that following the Great Britain consultation and the concerns raised, it was important to,</p>
<ul><a name="07010985000174"></a>&#147;make sure that there is effective protection from discrimination while ensuring that people have the right to religious freedom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000158"></a>Were the issues raised by the Great Britain regulations much more complex than those raised in Northern Ireland? Or is this yet another case of &#147;Northern Ireland&#151;so what&#148;?</p>

<a name="07010985000102"></a><b><a name="70109-0013.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07010985000206"></a>Lord Alli:</b> My Lords, the legislation that we discuss changes but the arguments remain the same.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07010985000103"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Blood for her very powerful speech. Some may have thought that the whole of Northern Ireland would oppose these laws, and my noble friend made it very clear that that was not the case.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07010985000104"></a>I would not normally speak on regulations affecting Northern Ireland, but as one of the few gay Peers in your Lordships' House, I know only too well how essential these regulations are. I argued passionately for them last year, and I pay particular tribute to the Government for ensuring that they have come forward. The widespread incidence of unfair treatment on the ground of sexual orientation led to this House supporting that amendment and voting to outlaw this kind of discrimination. I warned then that there would come a time when extending these provisions from religious groups which have these protections to lesbian and gay men would find opposition from those same religious groups which argued so successfully for the original legislation.</p>

<a name="70109-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07010985000105"></a>Look outside this building tonight, listen to the small but vocal crowd, and imagine how it feels to walk through that crowd and see so much prejudice directed towards you simply because you are gay, simply because you are yourself, simply because you exist. It is rank hypocrisy to object to this order, having argued for the very same protection for religious groups only a few months ago.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07010985000106"></a>I was prompted to speak tonight by a number of letters I have received from gay men and women living in Northern Ireland, urging this House to support the regulations. If your Lordships will permit me, I shall read a tiny extract from one of those letters:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="07010985000167"></a>&#147;What do the goods and services protections mean to me? Quite simply, they mean that as a citizen of Northern Ireland who happens to be gay, I will be afforded the same rights and civil liberties that others already enjoy ... I will be protected ... from people who wish to discriminate against me because I am gay. These regulations mean that I need no longer fear being denied hospital treatment. No longer will my partner and I be refused a double room together, causing the two of us such degrading embarrassment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07010985000107"></a>This is about real people and real people&#146;s lives and their right not to be discriminated against. It is about the politics of prejudice. Rather too often, that is forgotten in the sometimes fanciful claims made about the impact of these new laws. They are fair and balanced, and they give gay people in Northern Ireland the same level of protection that we all want for ourselves. I urge the noble Lord not to press his Motion to annul this important legislation, which will improve people&#146;s lives. If he does not listen to that plea, I ask this House to do what it has done on many other occasions, of which I am incredibly proud: to vote against it, reject his call and demonstrate overwhelmingly to the people of Northern Ireland and beyond that this House believes in fairness, justice and equal rights for all.</p>

This is a sensitive matter and it concerns Northern Ireland. For those reasons, I feel hesitant to dip my feet into the water, but I do so because I think that the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, is right to pray against these regulations.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07010985000109"></a>The Government are concerned that people should not be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. That is a perfectly reasonable point of view, but in their determination to see that that does not happen they are introducing regulations that will grossly discriminate against other people. As has been pointed out, the regulations fail to distinguish between same-sex attraction and homosexual activity. It is perfectly possible to show respect for the dignity of people who are attracted to a person of the same sex, but it is quite another thing to approve of homosexual activity. The churches do not do so and plenty of people who adhere to those churches do not do so either.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07010985000110"></a>The sexual orientation of a customer may be irrelevant to, for example, a shop assistant or a car mechanic, but it can be of considerable importance and relevance to others. We have heard the examples of the person who lets out a room and refuses to allow a gay couple to take it, the photographer who refuses to photograph a civil partnership ceremony and the printer who refuses to print a leaflet advertising a gay ceremony. They could all be prosecuted. These regulations are installing new rights for homosexual people which override the existing rights of others who are perfectly entitled to their views and their religious opinions.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07010985000111"></a>Part of the anxiety is due to the provisions in the regulations which make harassment on the grounds of  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sexual orientation illegal. Harassment is a subjective matter, depending on the perception of the person bringing the claim. If a person feels that his dignity has been violated and that someone has created a hostile, humiliating or offensive environment, he can sue. An organisation which is sued will be involved with legal costs in defending itself and possibly compensation. If that happens more than once or twice, such repeated actions can result in the business going into liquidation. That cannot be right. The Government said that it was not appropriate to legislate for harassment within the regulations, but that is precisely what they have done.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07010985000112"></a>In analysing the results of the consultation, the Government say that there seems to be some misunderstanding about what they intend. With the greatest respect, it does not matter what the Government intend; it is what the law says that matters; it is what the local authority official or the local lawyer reads into what is written that matters. They will say, &#147;The regulations say this and so we are right to do that&#148;, or, worse, &#147;The regulations say this, so we must do that&#148;. They are the ones who will enforce&#151;a word which the Government love&#151;the regulations. I believe that there is enough in the content of the regulations to make them quite inappropriate for passing into law.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07010985000113"></a>What about the circumstances of their introduction?</p>
<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="70109-0014.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="07010985000182"></a>9 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="07010985000114"></a><b><a name="70109-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010985000208"></a>Lord Smith of Finsbury:</b> My Lords, before the noble Earl leaves the point about content, does he agree with the existing law of this country which says that harassment against an individual on grounds of race is wrong? Does he also, therefore, agree that harassment against an individual on grounds of his sexual orientation should be wrong?</p>

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="07010985000115"></a><b><a name="70109-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010985000209"></a>Earl Ferrers:</b> My Lords, it is not as simple as that, as the noble Lord knows. The Government said it was an improper vehicle by which to introduce harassment because harassment is a perception by one person of another. That is why I think it is wrong for it to be done in this case.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07010985000116"></a>It is surprising, as the noble and right reverand Lord, Lord Eames, and others have said, that the consultation period lasted only eight weeks, even though it should have been 12 weeks. It has been pointed out that that was far too short a time, particularly as it was during the summer months. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments is still considering these regulations, despite the fact that they came into operation on 1 January. It would have been more courteous and more correct to have waited for the views of the Joint Committee, otherwise what is the point of having a Joint Committee?</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07010985000117"></a>Is not the real reason for all this that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was determined to get these regulations in place in Northern Ireland before Stormont takes over power, before 24 March? One wonders why the Secretary of State did not let Stormont make up its own mind on these delicate matters which relate to the people of Northern Ireland. As the unionists have more seats, he knew that, left to Stormont, the regulations would not have  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been introduced. One might then say, &#147;Let Stormont remove the regulations, if that is what it wants to do, as soon as it takes power&#148;. But that could not happen because&#151;I am not familiar with all the niceties of Northern Ireland politics&#151;Sinn Fein and the SDLP have a lock over these matters, and they would never agree to the regulations being removed.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07010985000118"></a>So, the Secretary of State is forcing these regulations on the people of Northern Ireland against their wishes, against the wishes of those who represent them and while the Secretary of State is still in a position to do so. Having done that, what will the Government do? They will say that now the regulations are in operation in Northern Ireland, we can have the same regulations for England and Wales. It is important that these regulations should not criminalise the practice of a person's faith, but they will. They tread over religious sensitivities and they create fear. The way in which they have been introduced is highly undesirable. For those reasons I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, will continue with his Prayer.</p>

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="07010985000119"></a><b><a name="70109-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010985000210"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches warmly welcome these regulations. We entirely support the Government&#146;s position. We very much hope that if this Prayer against the regulations is moved to a vote, it will be roundly defeated. I shall try briefly not to repeat what others have said, but to add new points.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07010985000120"></a>I found the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury, deeply impressive. He has made it unnecessary for me to say much of what I would otherwise have said. I am a former special adviser to the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland, and I have great affection for its people&#151;even though, particularly when talking about matters of sex, some of them sometimes nearly drive me demented. That is almost as bad as talking about religion.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07010985000121"></a>It has not been said tonight that Northern Ireland has been a pacesetter for anti-discrimination legislation, often leading the way with the rest of the United Kingdom following. I am old enough to remember the Van Straubenzee report, which led to the fair employment legislation that was much stronger than what I was able to accomplish at the Home Office in the mid-1970s. Under the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, that was strengthened greatly in 1989; we had nothing comparable to it. Remarkably, in Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, there is a provision compelling the promotion of equality of opportunity between people of different sexual orientation, among other things. We do not have that, of course. There is already a human rights commission in Northern Ireland, and a single equality commission. Work has progressed on a single equality Bill from a fairly early stage. It is not at all unusual for Northern Ireland to be first with excellent civil rights legislation on discrimination.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07010985000122"></a>These regulations must be read in context. No noble Lord has yet done so. First, there is the international context, now part of our system through the Human Rights Act 1998. These regulations, as the Human Rights Act commands, must be read and given effect,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if possible, in a way compatible with fundamental human rights and freedoms. Those fundamental rights include freedom of religion, conscience, speech, association and non-discrimination. Therefore, when courts have to interpret and apply regulations, they must make quite sure that they do not disproportionately or excessively encroach upon those fundamental freedoms. Some points made by noble Lords on free speech or freedom of religion are simply points about the importance of those rights, against which these regulations, like all regulations, must, if possible, be read.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07010985000123"></a>Although freedom of religion is a vital freedom, as are freedom of conscience and freedom of speech, so is equal treatment without discrimination. The European Convention on Human Rights provides that everyone is entitled to the enjoyment of the rights in that convention without discrimination, covering, for example, sexual orientation. It applies, for example, to education. There must be no discrimination based on sexual orientation in education, otherwise Article 2 of the first protocol of the convention, read with Article 14, would be breached.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07010985000124"></a>That is relevant because if the Government did not introduce these regulations in Northern Ireland and comparable regulations in the rest of the United Kingdom and there were then a victim of, say, sexual orientation discrimination in access to education, the UK would be in breach of the European convention. In particular, it would be in breach of Article 13, which says that there must be an effective national remedy. I hope the Minister will confirm that the United Kingdom, in introducing these regulations, is among other things giving effect to our international obligations. The same will apply when other regulations&#151;not a primary Bill&#151;are later introduced in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07010985000125"></a>That is not all. The Northern Ireland Act, as noble Lords from Northern Ireland will know better than I do, does not devolve responsibility for compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. That matter was specifically reserved to central government. Therefore, even the great Stormont, when it is able to function again, does not have the power to act in a way that over-rides or disregards human rights. The Secretary of State may, if necessary, deal with the matter. If Stormont were to repeal these regulations I am not at all sure whether that would not of itself involve a breach of the human rights legislation and the European convention.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07010985000126"></a>We are not dealing in a vacuum so far as concerns earlier legislation. The Republic of Ireland enacted similar legislation as long ago as 2000 in the Equal Status Act. It covered sexual orientation discrimination and harassment in similarly loose and vague terms. I am not aware that there has been any abuse or that any problem has arisen in the Irish Republic, a point made on 11 December when the transitional Assembly had that extraordinary debate on these regulations. The DUP was isolated politically in that debate, the other Northern Ireland political parties speaking in favour of the regulations in the main, while the DUP had its commitment against the regulations. Points were made again and again about, for example, the situation in the Irish Republic.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_203"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07010985000127"></a>The regulations are also not in a vacuum so far as concerns our own law. In 2003 the employment equality regulations dealing with sexual orientation were passed in virtually identical form. All that the Government have done is to extend them to education, goods, services, facilities and public sector duties. In the way that they have done for gender, race and religion, they have now done the same for sexual orientation. So far as I am aware, there has been no problem in the interpretation and application of the 2003 regulations. No noble Lord today has suggested to the contrary.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07010985000128"></a>I am not an uncritical supporter of what the Government are doing. On behalf of my party I should make that clear. In the first place, although it is now academic, we believe that there should have been a single equality Bill which put together all the different strands and could have been, therefore, a coherent piece of legislation rather than bits and pieces in regulations one after the other. In that way, the public and Members of both Houses might have understood better the pattern of legislation. But that is water under the bridge.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07010985000129"></a>I am also concerned, as are other noble Lords, about the vaguely defined concept of harassment. As has been said, I moved successfully the amendment to the then Equality Bill which removed the concept of religious harassment, mainly because of my concern for free speech and the divisiveness of having one religion pitted against another in the county court with no filter leading to compensatory remedies. That seems mischievous and to do no good. I very much hope that our support today for the harassment provisions in these regulations is not interpreted by the Government as a green light for support by us for doing the same thing with religious harassment. Religious harassment is different. It implicates free speech and religious practices in a completely different way. The reason that I think that the Government were right in the consultation to change their minds as they did about sexual orientation harassment becoming a civil wrong is because, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, among others, pointed out, when you harass a person because they are gay you are harassing them for something with which they are born. When you harass a woman because she is a woman, it is because of her gender. When you harass someone because of their race, it is because of their birthright. Because harassment against gays is a particularly widespread social evil in this country, it seems to me that the Government were right during the consultation to change their minds. They were open-minded. They had reservations to begin with.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07010985000130"></a>The Government have been criticised this evening about the consultation, and it will be for the Minister to answer the criticisms that have been made. However, in fairness, I would like to point out that the consultation led the Government to widen the exceptions in favour of freedom of religion. They therefore used the consultation process in an open-minded way. I believe that they gave too many concessions to faith groups, just as they did in the employment equality regulations,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but that is again water under the bridge. It will be for courts in due course to decide whether what has been done is compatible with the Human Rights Act, but that is for the future.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07010985000131"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, mentioned the judicial review proceeding. That has nothing to do with the matter we are concerned with this evening. The judge in Northern Ireland refused an application on judicial review for an interim order to hold up making the regulations law. He said that he was willing to hear arguments of all kinds in March, but was not willing to impede the legislative process. We are therefore completely free this evening to take our own view of the matter.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07010985000132"></a>Finally, no noble Lord has mentioned the extraordinary debate that took place in the transitional Assembly on 11 December. A great deal has been said about the position of the churches, but what about the position of the politicians, the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland? I urge your Lordships to read that rather dispiriting debate, and if noble Lords do, they will see that the Alliance Party, the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Progressive Unionist Party all spoke in favour of the regulations. It was the DUP that opposed them. There was a tied vote so the regulations stood. We have the benefit not only of the consultation but of the consultation with the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. Therefore, let it not be said that we are somehow now riding roughshod. It is not our fault that the politicians in Northern Ireland have not got their act together sufficiently to be able to have their Assembly back again, but the sooner they do that, the better. Meanwhile, we are here to protect fundamental rights, and I hope that this evening we will defeat the Motion roundly.</p>

<a name="07010985000133"></a><b><a name="70109-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07010985000211"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, it is always disconcerting to follow such an elegant speaker as the noble Lord, Lord Lester. We have heard some very passionate, well argued speeches in the House tonight. This party is not whipped; we have a free vote. My view, and this party&#146;s point of view, is that there are some key issues relating to the way in which in recent times, under the present Secretary of State, the Government have been attempting to handle Northern Ireland legislation. Those who listen to Northern Ireland debates on a regular basis will know exactly what I am talking about and will have heard me say it before.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07010985000134"></a>However, to make the point, where we come from, this is not a political issue. There are strongly held views, and we accept that, so I do not intend to detain the House for very long. That said, these regulations have aroused considerable controversy inside and outside Parliament, and the reasons why have been made clear tonight by the many speakers from different angles and different points of view. All the speakers, including, to some extent, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, have qualms about whether the Government have got this right.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07010985000135"></a>At this stage, I have several questions to which I want precise answers from the Minister&#151;I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. Before that, I shall say something that has already been said, but I shall repeat it. It relates to the way in which these regulations  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been introduced in Northern Ireland. As with the new rating system, there is a very strong feeling back home in Northern Ireland that Northern Ireland is being used as a testing ground for Great Britain. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, nodding.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07010985000136"></a>As the Government have no votes in Northern Ireland and, deplorably, no intention of seeking any, they simply continue to run Northern Ireland by diktat, irrespective of local opinion. Of course, the standard government reply is that politicians should agree on the restoration of the Assembly&#151;well, they have not helped it much recently&#151;yet I see no reason why these regulations had to be rushed through in Northern Ireland with minimal consultation prior to the possible restoration of the Assembly on 26 March. In case anybody wonders why I said that the Government have not helped very much, the Prime Minister&#146;s outburst in the <I>Irish Times</I> was not helpful at all and led Ian Paisley to contradict him at a very delicate time.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07010985000137"></a>I ask noble Lords to contrast what the Government are doing in Northern Ireland with the position in England and Wales. First, we were given a consultation period of eight weeks in Northern Ireland; in England, it was 12 weeks. Here in England, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government delayed, as has already been said, the introduction of the regulations so that they could be properly debated. In the other place, she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="07010985000168"></a>&#147;It is only right that we take the time to consider properly such a complex issue&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010985000159"></a>and we have heard how complex it is tonight&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07010985000138"></a>Nobody could disagree with those good intentions, yet the Government have sought to push the equivalent regulations for Northern Ireland through Parliament under the negative resolution procedure, thus attempting to deny any debate whatever. That is the arrogance of Mr Hain.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07010985000139"></a>It is due only to the pressure put on the Government by my honourable friend the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary and parliamentary colleagues from Northern Ireland that the regulations for Northern Ireland are being debated at all, after they have effectively been introduced. Once again, Northern Ireland is being treated shabbily and arrogantly by this Government when it comes to the method of introducing legislation.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07010985000140"></a>I shall raise a few points about the regulations over which there is a genuine lack of understanding and clarity, and which have caused concern. The first is about the provisions relating to harassment, which has been at the top of most speakers&#146; agenda tonight. The Minister will know that this matter has exercised a number of people, and it was raised on the radio this morning by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern.</p>

<a name="70109-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07010985000141"></a>The Government initially indicated that they were not inclined to include these provisions. Will the noble Lord tell us what moved the Secretary of State once  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>again to change his mind on a statement that he had made only a few days previously? Considerable concern has been expressed about what precisely might constitute harassment. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, was eloquent on that subject, but, I believe, had some doubts as to how these provisions might be interpreted. The very broad way in which they are drafted also leaves open the possibility of a flood of test cases. For example, could a minister or priest who refused to serve communion to somebody on the ground that homosexual acts are sinful be sued for harassment? Will the Minister tell us how he thinks that can be avoided? What safeguards exist for people who simply act in accordance with what they sincerely believe to be the literal truth of the Gospel?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70109-0015.htm"/>


<a name="70109-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07010985000142"></a>The Government talk about getting the balance right between effective protection from discrimination and the rights of people to their sincerely held religious beliefs and convictions. But what safeguards are there, to use an example that has already been given, for a church-based adoption society that refuses to place a child for adoption with a gay or lesbian couple? What about a church-run housing society that refuses a double room to a gay or lesbian couple? What about the position of faith-based schools, where there is potential for conflict with the regulations due to sincerely held religious beliefs and convictions?</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07010985000143"></a>Much emphasis has been placed on the position of those running guest houses, about which we have heard a lot tonight. What about guest houses whose owners refuse to let rooms to any unmarried couple? For the purposes of these regulations, can they still refuse to let rooms to people who are unmarried but in a civil partnership? Again, so much in the legislation is vague and will inevitably lead to test cases. Knowing the population in Northern Ireland, I can assure noble Lords that there will be those who want to test it, push it and try it.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07010985000144"></a>What will be the position of church halls or Northern Ireland&#146;s Orange halls? Will they be exempt on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs and convictions? Many church halls and Orange halls in Northern Ireland are hired out to non-church groups for dance classes and keep fit, to cite two examples, and political meetings are regularly held in Orange halls. But neither church halls nor Orange halls would be hired out to groups or people who are fundamentally at odds with the organisations&#146; Christian ethos or sincerely held religious beliefs and convictions. I fear that that is yet more scope for litigation.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07010985000145"></a>As I made clear earlier, these regulations are the subject of a free vote for my party. Nothing I have said today on their detail should be taken to indicate a party view. That said, my personal view is that the way in which these regulations have been handled is yet another example of the Government&#146;s deaf, uncaring arrogance to the people of Northern Ireland. The current regulations should be abandoned and the Government should develop new regulations that properly balance sexual orientation and religious liberty rights following a proper consultation process, followed up with full parliamentary debate, as proposed by the Minister in another place when referring to proposed

The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, made it very clear that we could find ourselves in the ridiculous position of being a small part of the United Kingdom with a totally different set of standards and rules from those that will come out of the legislative process for the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07010985000146"></a>This has been a wonderful debate. It has been a great honour that so many people have taken time to speak on what is at base a Northern Ireland issue but one that has clearly touched the whole community of the kingdom. I have sought to raise a few concerns expressed to me and many colleagues in both Houses. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="0701105000002"></a><b><a name="70109-0015.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0701105000321"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful for noble Lords&#146; contributions and will do my level best to answer all their specific questions. I do not intend to speak for long, but I wish to put on record the detailed answers to those questions. So much of what has been said outside this House about the regulations is inaccurate. Some things have been said in ignorance of what has actually happened regarding these regulations. It is important to get it right.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0701105000003"></a>I wish to start with some procedural points. This is not the Government riding roughshod over Northern Ireland. It is a negative resolution for one reason only: direct rule. If this resolution were being taken in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would be a draft affirmative resolution. Under the rules of direct rule, primary legislation ends up as an Order in Council&#151;unsatisfactory, but that is the rule&#151;and an affirmative resolution ends up as a negative resolution. It will be put slightly differently in the other place for GB legislation&#151;as it is not direct rule, the procedure is slightly different. We are following the rules set out for direct rule. We wish there was not direct rule, but that is in the hands of Northern Ireland politicians not the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0701105000004"></a>Only the noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred to the fact that these regulations&#151;which are what we are debating tonight, not an idea or resolution&#151;were debated for a half day in the transitional Assembly in Northern Ireland on 11 December, less than a month ago. There is a full <I>Hansard</I> record of that debate. The motion was similar to what it is tonight&#151;that is, to withdraw the regulations and leave the issue to be determined by the Assembly. It was effectively a motion to nullify. Out of 108 Members, the vote was 39 to 39. As such it was a dead heat and therefore was not carried; there was no majority.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0701105000005"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, the mix of parties in favour of the regulations included the mainly nationalist parties. It also included the late David Ervine. There was a mix of party-political views in favour of these regulations by the elected politicians, the very people who we keep saying ought to make the decisions in Northern Ireland and get back and do the full job they are paid for. That happened and nobody referred to it in this debate. Indeed, one or two noble Lords said it was a tragedy and that the elected politicians of Northern Ireland had not had an opportunity to debate this. It is there on the record. I have to make that absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0701105000006"></a>One of the points made related to procedure. There are some misnomers as, since I left the other place, procedures have changed and I do not always keep up with them. The Great Britain regulations&#151;they will cover England, Scotland and Wales&#151;will be brought forward in due course. The plan was to do both together. The sequence of timing last summer was such that they would be published together and go through the Houses together. As I will explain in a moment, the level of response for Great Britain was far greater than in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland&#151;I am not devaluing anyone&#146;s contribution&#151;the 400 consultation responses were all basically on one very narrow issue, so it was much easier. Because of the agreement the Government have with the CBI and business to bring in secondary legislation and regulations on two specific dates in the year, if we miss the slot for October-November we are then on the next slot, which is around April. That was done for all regulations at the request of business, so that we were not bringing different statutory instruments out every week of the year impinging on the business community. It was part of a deregulatory business, so that is the reason for that consequence of dates.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0701105000007"></a>I thank everyone who has spoken today. I just want to put on record&#151;</p>

They have now been held back for further consultation. The possibility exists that that consultation might result in changes to the GB regulations. If that happens, can the Minister assure us that the Northern Ireland regulations will then be amended to be brought into line with the GB regulations and thus keep the parity that was there at the outset?</p>

It is the intention, whatever the case may be, to have broad parity between the regulations within the United Kingdom so there should not be any major difficulty with that.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0701105000010"></a>Before I come to the set piece and answer some of the questions I would just like to run by the House some of the issues these regulations do not cover. They do not impact on the taught curriculum in schools in Northern Ireland&#151;that is a matter for the Department of Education. The regulations cannot lead to the promotion of homosexuality in schools. They are concerned not with what is taught in schools but with ensuring fair and equal access to education and the facilities and services associated with it. It is not the Government&#146;s intention to attack religious ethos.</p>

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="0701105000011"></a><b><a name="70109-0015.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0701105000324"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> Would the regulations allow a charge of harassment to be brought against an education authority by an aggrieved parent?</p>

<a name="0701105000014"></a><b><a name="70109-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0701105000327"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, it would depend on the merits and the circumstances of the case. There is a reasonable test for a responsible person. The courts would make a judgment on that, but these regulations do not impact on the curriculum of what is taught in class&#151;I make that absolutely clear. That is a completely separate issue so far as the law in Northern Ireland is concerned. It is not the Government&#146;s intention to attack religious ethos, teaching or practice, and the regulations contain exceptions that protect the doctrinal nature of religious observance. We have applied an exception to the regulations intended to ensure that matters of a doctrinal nature are protected.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0701105000015"></a>I was asked a specific question by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about offering the sacrament. The right of a minister to refuse communion is absolutely protected under Regulations 16(3)(b) and 16(4)(a). It is quite clear. The answer is that they would be protected. It is there in the regulations. We have heard criticisms from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that the exemptions have gone much further than he would have wished.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0701105000016"></a>In terms of accommodation, I know that there has not been a massive distinction in this, but there has been a throwaway line about &#147;your own home&#148;. No one can be forced to live with someone they do not wish to live with. Subject to certain conditions on the size of the property and the permanent residence of the property, that will be protected in the regulations. However, if you are running a commercial enterprise in the United Kingdom, you follow normal rules and you do not discriminate on religion, colour, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. That is what the regulations are designed for.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0701105000017"></a>One further point was raised about the consultation. The four main churches had meetings with Ministers on no fewer than three occasions relating to the regulations. Whatever the distance and timing of the consultation&#151;eight weeks&#151;the four main churches had meetings on three separate occasions. Nobody can argue that their main concerns were not met. Indeed, the press release put out by the Evangelical Alliance on 23 November states that it,</p>
<ul><a name="0701105000047"></a>&#147;acknowledges the work done by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in listening to the concerns of religious organisations and subsequently providing exemptions to ensure that core doctrinal beliefs are not undermined&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701105000046"></a>The idea that churches and those of faith have been ignored and not been party to consultation or discussion does not stand up to examination.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0701105000018"></a>The regulations have been drafted to allow for the views and opinions of religious groups and organisations to be protected where it is necessary to comply with doctrine. We do not accept the arguments put forward that churches will be forced to admit as members people whom they do not wish to belong to their church where that desire is motivated by their sincerely held religious views. Regulation 16 is specific on that point: no church or other religious group will as a result of the regulations be required to bless civil partnerships or undertake any sacramental or other core religious practice or observance that conflicts with their beliefs. That could not be more specific in dealing with the myths. I thought that it was a sin to tell a lie.</p>

<a name="0701105000020"></a><b><a name="70109-0015.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0701105000329"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am not accusing anyone in this House of telling a lie, but it is what has been written and said outside.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0701105000021"></a>Much has been said about bookshops. There was an example given here tonight about the hypothetical Christian businessman or women who will be required to act against his or her conscience when the regulations are enacted. The Government think that it would be wrong to elevate the human rights of one group over and above those of another group. We are trying to get equality of rights to stop discrimination. That is central to the regulations. It does not matter whether it is a bookshop, if it is a commercial bookshop. If a group in the voluntary sector sets itself up in business to do other things&#151;running a mother and toddlers&#146; group, for example&#151;and invites the public to use its building to bring in income and to embrace the community, would it refuse access to a toddler who had two mums? That is nonsense; it is a commercial activity and that would be a breach of these regulations. It does not affect their doctrinal beliefs, the giving of communion or anything like that. If people open up a business, whatever the business they are bound by the laws of the state, passed by Parliament, to exclude discrimination. That is the essence of what we want to do.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0701105000022"></a>Many noble Lords raised the issue of harassment, and I accept from the debates we have had in this House in the short time that I have been here that, for many people, it is contentious. It is difficult for some people to grasp, as the problems we have had here show. It is wrong to say that we have ignored the will of the people of Northern Ireland and introduced some sweeping new offence. We have not done that. The definition applied to harassment in these regulations is exactly the same as that applied in other anti-discrimination legislation. It is subject, as elsewhere, to a test of reasonableness.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0701105000023"></a>It is not enough, as has been suggested by some speeches, for a person to allege that they were placed in an environment which they found intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive. You have got to go far beyond that. In all cases, a court will decide, taking account of all the relevant circumstances and the facts of the case, whether a reasonable man or woman would have felt harassed in such an environment. While the Government cannot legislate to prevent malicious prosecutions, we believe the test is a stringent one. In addition, we still have the benefits of the Human Rights Act and the need for proportionality and propriety. The courts will have to determine whether such issues fall within the Act. In the end we have to rely on the good sense of the judiciary and the safeguards applied in the regulations.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0701105000024"></a>I shall try to answer some of the detailed questions asked. The issue of harassment was raised in consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about that. There was an issue about what we were minded to do. There were lots of discussions as well as written consultations over that period.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0701105000025"></a>The noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, made a powerful speech. I think the whole House would agree with his point about procedures used for  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_211"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column 211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation relating to Northern Ireland. We have made the commitment&#151;I repeat it now though I do not have the exact words in front of me&#151;that if there is no devolution on 26 March then we will come forward with a different set of proposals for how we deal with Northern Ireland legislation in this House and in the other place. That is our firm commitment and we do not resile from it. We do not want to publish a Plan B because we want Plan A to succeed, but that it is our commitment. The noble and most reverend Lord raised all the issues that are wrong and defective about the way we do it now&#151;I say defective rather than wrong. We are in a difficult position now, but I repeat the point about meeting the churches on three occasions.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0701105000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, raised the issue of polls. A MORI poll prior to the consultation showed that 80 per cent plus agreed that discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation was not acceptable. That was a MORI poll. We have the elected politicians refusing to nullify the regulations and an 80 per cent MORI poll.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0701105000027"></a>As I said about the eight-week period, this was chosen to meet the GB commitments to lay the orders at the same time. I hope I have explained that satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0701105000028"></a>I listened to the interview with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and read his powerful piece in the <I>Telegraph </I>this morning, as I also read Polly Toynbee&#146;s equally powerful piece in the <I>Guardian</I>. These regulations are not concerned with homosexual practice or the facilitation of such acts. They concern only sexual orientation. Nothing prevents people having a belief. These regulations are designed to capture where they manifest that belief by discriminating against people. It is as simple and clear cut as that.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0701105000029"></a>On whether the regulations will be withdrawn if the English regulations are not passed, the answer is no. The Secretary of State has the power under the Equality Act 2006 and believes this is required for Northern Ireland&#151;where there is support for it.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0701105000030"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, people are entitled to air their views on any subject but not to discriminate. That is the central issue of the regulations.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0701105000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, also raised points about the Written Questions from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the Answers that he received. Transexuality is actually dealt with under the gender laws and is not covered by these regulations, so the Answers that he quoted and the Explanatory Notes are both correct. There is no contradiction there.</p>

The fact of the matter is that the doctor and the hospital are providing the services, not the patient; so the issue is not covered by the regulations. So there is no issue about that.

The judicial review application was for a suspension of these regulations from 1 January. The judge refused that and said, &#147;No, Parliament should take its course. That is where the regulations are being debated and I will have a look at this in a few weeks&#146; time, in March&#148;. That is what he intends to do.</p>

There is a separate issue to be dealt with here for GB and Northern Ireland; it has to be dealt with differently.</p>

<a name="70109-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0701105000035"></a>I do not apologise for saying this because I have said it so often before, but while direct rule continues and the Northern Ireland politicians refuse to take their responsibilities and go back, we shall not cease the pace of reform. The Secretary of State made it clear that the pace will quicken if they do not go back. We have made it abundantly clear that the status quo is not an option. We want devolution back on 26 March. If it is not back then, we will come forward with a better way in which to deal with legislation in Northern Ireland&#151;and I have to say that we will have to deal with a new system for dealing with legislation for Northern Ireland for quite a long time if devolution does not take place on 26 March. Therefore, I hope that these regulations will be approved.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000010"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010983000444"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> After what I hope was a pleasant Christmas break for everyone and with wishes for a happy new year, including to the Minister and his team, we return to the question of what is the point of this Bill. It aims to abolish Energywatch, Postwatch and the National Consumer Council, and to create a new National Consumer Council which will subsume the duties of those bodies. In opposing the Motion that this clause shall stand part, we question the wisdom of abolishing Energywatch and ask the Government to make their case for doing so. In asking that, I want to make a number of points, particularly given that the energy market is going through a volatile phase at the moment.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000011"></a>Any consumer can tell you that they feel under considerable pressure to switch energy suppliers, which is a recognised way of saving money on fuel bills. However, very clever people out there who are not directly employed by the energy companies but hired at second-hand in what I might describe as a pyramid-selling scheme through firms in the pay of the energy companies, go around organising the switch of customers from one account to another. This rather febrile atmosphere has lead to a situation where in our view consumers need as much protection from a body like Energywatch as they can get. My central question to the Government is this: is the new body, one that may dilute the expertise of Energywatch and which will have split functions in terms of complaints and advocacy, really going to be a better solution as regards consumers?</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000012"></a>I can understand that the DTI wants to streamline things and save money, and that is a perfectly admirable aim. However, if by doing so the Government save themselves a little money while the process costs consumers considerably more simply because they will not have such a good body representing their interests, I do not believe that that  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is to their benefit. We only have to look at the work of Energywatch on smart metering to realise that what it does can have considerable benefits for consumers. It would be a terrific step forward if the Government were to take Energywatch&#146;s comments on smart metering firmly on board and progress the issue. Consumers would gain because they would be able to reduce their fuel bills by introducing better consumption patterns rather than just switching from one supplier to another. That contributes nothing in terms of tackling the issues around carbon emissions. Smart metering can provide a win-win situation in which consumers save money and the environment suffers from fewer carbon emissions. Energywatch has made a strong case for the Government to make a move on smart metering and, indeed, for Ofgem to take this on board.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000013"></a>My fear is that this kind of work, which benefits consumers and the climate-change agenda, will not fall into the remit of the NCC in the same way as it falls into that of Energywatch. It empowers consumers to do what they cannot do at the moment: that is, to sell the surplus energy they create through micro-generation back into the grid. Indeed, suppliers of energy could save on costs because they would have reduced contact and would not need people going around reading meters.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000014"></a>Finally, the biggest plus from the point of view of Energywatch is that the huge number of difficulties over billing would disappear because the smart meters would feed the information back directly to the energy companies. Many bills are estimated and incorrect bills cause great difficulties, but cases such as those to which we referred on the first day in Committee would disappear as a result of smart metering. If the Government continue down the path of abolishing Energywatch, which I believe they intend to do, perhaps a very good legacy of the work done by the staff of Energywatch to date would be for the Government to make a move to ensure that smart meters are brought in.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000015"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010983000445"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> This is a rather pointless amendment but, none the less, it should be addressed. As far as I can see, we have an argument in favour of smart metering which is totally irrelevant to anyone who has had any dealings with Ofgem in the recent past. Meters were made to last and they will last for 40 years. It would cost an incredible amount of money to get rid of all of them. It would be possible but the carbon effect involved in the manufacturing of their replacement would greatly outweigh the savings to which the noble Baroness has alluded. She surely wants to read again and think about this part of her brief. It is a great idea but it would cost an awful lot of money. The cost would have to be borne by consumers who, frankly, balance up the advantages to the environment against the advantages to their own pockets.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000016"></a>While smart metering has, to an extent, been tried in Northern Ireland with the blessing of Energywatch and the regulators operating over there, I am not sure that that is the best argument for it if we are going to abolish our consumer protection body which I think  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>most people will agree has been fairly effective. Consumers have confidence in it, the regulators get annoyed by it and the companies do not really like it. By and large those are three substantial ticks in the boxes. If the regulators feel at times uneasy because the consumer watchdog keeps spurring them on to do other things, that is a good argument for the watchdog. There should be an atmosphere of creative tension between the two. If the companies find it uncomfortable, the regulators are doing their job.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000017"></a>The test is whether this is only about saving money. If it is not, we have to give it a fair wind. I think that part of the problem we have with the energy industry in this country is that successive Governments&#151;certainly the previous Conservative Administration when they privatised the energy industries&#151;gave precious little thought to liberalisation and effective means of consumer protection. They did not think through anything other than the amount of money they were going to get through the privatisation sell off.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000018"></a>We are slowly but surely picking up the pieces. As we have seen, consumer protection can take a variety of forms but, in large measure, the reforms that took place in the early part of this century tidied things up a bit, but you still had regional committees with varying powers in different parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000019"></a>Equally, we had a National Consumer Council that was certainly not a giant but which was sleeping a fair bit of that time. Those of us who have watched consumer affairs from down the Corridor were not greatly impressed by the record of the National Consumer Council. It was barely reactive and only rarely proactive as a body. In recent years, it has improved its game somewhat, but it still has an awful lot to do. If it is reinforced by people from Postwatch and Energywatch, who have shown themselves to be effective representatives and defenders of the consumer, we will begin to see something happen.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000020"></a>On energy matters and postal matters&#151;I know that we will go on to look at postal matters in a moment, but I think that the two can be taken together&#151;there has been effective consumer representation. There has not been that kind of effective consumer representation by the National Consumer Council. It has commissioned worthy studies; it has made general points; but it has not made many businesses fear its activities or made their flesh creep. Energywatch has certainly done that for a number of energy companies.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000021"></a>I am concerned that the momentum that has been gathering in the past few years as a result of Energywatch&#146;s actions should not be stopped. Later this afternoon, we will be looking for assurances on specific matters, such as the speed with which consumer complaints should be addressed. Although the Minister gave us assurances on Second Reading, we need rather more substantial detail and flesh on the bones than that. The test of the Motion is: if the Government cannot give assurances, the clause may later be voted down. If it was, that would probably wreck the Bill, so it would become, instead of a probing amendment, a wrecking amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000022"></a>The Minister has a case to make and I hope that he will be able to make it this afternoon. It is, at least in the first instance, that we have a new body of which the umbrella will be the National Consumer Council, that it will initially take in the functions of Energywatch and Postwatch and will ultimately include water as well. If it is that successful, it may persuade the Treasury that it can take in financial services later. That is for other legislation because it is not within the Bill, although I have to say that if it is a sufficiently good idea for energy, in my view, it is a good enough idea to include financial services in something independent of the Treasury&#151;although you might say that in any Government few things are independent of the Treasury.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000023"></a>If there is an argument for the Bill, it is that it will continue the necessary shaking-up process of the National Consumer Council, but it will also bring energy matters into the mainstream of consumer issues. There are some specific problems&#151;metering, people knocking on doors, switching and so on. Although in most other areas people switch between one service provider and another, in utilities, it is a wee bit different. But if we are to have an argument about switching and say that it should be a function of the National Consumer Council, why do we not include telecoms in the Bill as well? Telecoms are still a shared function between the DTI and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. There is an awful lot of untoward activity against consumers in that area, but at the moment we have an organisation that, frankly, I believe to be far too close to Ofcom to be doing its job independently.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000024"></a>My only concern about the absorption of Energywatch and Postwatch into the National Consumer Council is that it becomes a wee bit too close to some other operations. That is what worries me because we must ensure that in their new form those consumer bodies continue to be able to act independently against companies when a challenge has to be made. They do not necessarily need to have a confrontational approach all the time, but, let us face it, energy companies in the United Kingdom are not bywords for philanthropy. They have to be challenged, harried and held to account. So far, Energywatch has not done badly in that regard, while the record of the National Consumer Council has been less than compelling in its ability to have a go at some of the big abusers of market power in Britain. Therefore, I am happy to give the Government a fair wind on the amendment, which I know is probing. Does the noble Baroness wish to intervene or ask a question?</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord think that the people who currently work in Energywatch or the new consumer council for water&#151;with whom I am very impressed and are light on their feet&#151;will feel about being subsumed into a moribund, reactive organisation? If I worked for Energywatch, I would not be happy about that at all and I might wish to pack my bags and go away. There is a chance that some of the best people in those organisations who have been running their own operation brilliantly would say, &#147;Oh well, forget this&#151;I am not going to join this organisation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000026"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010983000447"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I thought that I had qualified my criticisms of the National Consumer Council by saying that until fairly recently it was a bit of a sleeping dwarf. Excuse my sizeist language, but, at best, it under-punched its weight considerably and was not very effective. Of late, it has been far more effective and far more proactive. The injection of individuals from Postwatch and Energywatch could well carry on that process and add a dynamic to it. The idea that we should segment the consumer protection industry, as it were, is dangerous, because there are degrees of overlap in a number of areas and the degrees of expertise are common to many utility advocacy roles. It is possible to create a seamless organisation.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000027"></a>For the moment, segmentation will continue in other areas, but there is a case to be made for further energising&#151;perhaps I should use a better word&#151;further injecting some urgency into the activities of the National Consumer Council, which has come a long way in a comparatively short time, along with Postwatch and Energywatch. Postwatch is a relatively new body, as is Energywatch. A number of people will leave, but there is always a turnover in such organisations and I imagine that a number of people will be interested to see what the new body is like and will hang on for a bit longer. Others will have been looking for a chance to leave and are taking it now. When you bring together public bodies, there will always be a degree of shake-out. All I can say is that while I do not expect us to have a vote on this amendment&#151;we do not behave like that in these Committees&#151;it should be rejected and the Government should be supported on this issue, with the qualifications that I have expressed.</p>

The Minister is going to reply&#151;I thought that he sat down and did not want to.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000030"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for raising issues such as smart metering and itemised billing in energy, because this is one of the areas that the Government are looking at as part of the energy review process,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and we will be looking in detail at those measures. This is the second day of Grand Committee. My officials and I have looked very carefully at the report of the first day in <I>Hansard</I>, and we are doing our best to meet many of the concerns that were expressed on that day. We do listen very carefully to what noble Lords have to say during proceedings.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000031"></a>One or two specific issues were raised initially on Energywatch. We intend the sectoral expertise of Energywatch to be guaranteed as part of the new NCC. There is no intention at all to diminish the role of a body that represents consumers of energy. The new NCC will continue to carry out the sectoral functions currently undertaken by sectoral consumer bodies such as Energywatch. As I said, there is no intention of diminishing the role that Energywatch currently plays when it adopts its new form and is subsumed into the NCC. I also reassure my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan that there is no intention of presenting this as a money-saving measure. That is not the intention; the intention is to have a more coherent advocate for consumers across a range of areas.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000032"></a>My noble friend also mentioned telecoms. The telecoms industry currently has a consumer panel, and when the Government looked into which sectors representing consumers should be incorporated into the NCC, they saw that telecoms had an independent regulator with powers and duties to protect consumers and teeth to sort out suppliers, an independent consumer panel to advise on specific issues, and an industry-funded independent ombudsman. In that sense, it already has a very good structure, so it is not felt appropriate at this stage to incorporate it into the NCC.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000033"></a>On the general issue of Clause 13, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for tabling the Question and thus for the opportunity to debate this important clause today. I am pleased to have had the benefit of the insights of noble Lords who have already contributed to the debate. In speaking to the clause, I draw attention to the importance that I attach to preserving the very best elements of the current arrangements, especially where they provide important powers that can be used to the benefit of consumers. In markets with a sectoral regulator, that regulator has great responsibilities to ensure the proper operation of the market and to ensure that licence holders conduct themselves appropriately in line with their obligations under the licences, codes and agreements. This is in the interests of consumers. Indeed, the primary statutory objective of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority in carrying out its functions is to protect the interests of consumers. This is what the clause refers to. To back up its statutory objectives, the authority has enforcement powers that enable it to secure compliance with the important obligations placed on licensees in the energy sector.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000034"></a>We need to preserve the ability of the authority to bring to bear its powers in support of the consumer interest, and in aid of that enforcement role, by making provision in the Bill for the council to alert the authority of issues within its regulatory remit wherever appropriate and necessary. That is what the  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clause currently delivers for consumers; it focuses on resolving problems in the most effective way. Where the regulator has enforcement powers in respect of the complaints made by the consumer, it is sensible to ensure that the regulator is aware of that complaint and has the opportunity to use such powers to resolve it.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000035"></a>That position is not different from the current one, and we are keen to maintain proper and effective means to address consumer detriment. Consequently, Clause 13 makes provision for the new council to refer a complaint made under Clause 10(1)(a), or one to which Clauses 11(3) or 12(1) apply, to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, where the new NCC considers that the authority&#146;s regulatory functions may be exercisable unless the authority is already aware of the matter. Where a complaint is made under Clause 12(2) in respect of gas or electricity disconnection and is referred by the council to the authority, the council is not obliged to investigate the complaint until the authority has had a reasonable chance to exercise its enforcement functions.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000036"></a>The clause provides for the council to notify a complainant if the council considers that a complaint referred to it relates to a matter that can be referred to the authority under existing legislative provision. This ensures that the complainant is informed of the most appropriate route for effective resolution of the problem. The clause, as it stands, is currently a good one, and will ensure that consumers are adequately protected.</p>

I simply wanted to make a point at this moment. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, for his contribution. He said this was a pointless amendment, but without it we would not have seen the expertise he subsequently displayed to us. The Minister&#146;s comments, that he and his officials are considering the points we made on day one of Committee, are helpful. For us, given the comments during the debate on this clause, the most effective way of ensuring that the new body has teeth remains to convert those contentious &#147;mays&#148; to &#147;must&#148; or &#147;shall&#148;. That issue remains at the heart of some of our concerns about Energywatch and the other bodies that we shall debate shortly.</p>

Many of the arguments are similar to those regarding Energywatch, so I will not rehearse the generality of those. I will just say that the need for sectoral expertise is just the same, and we are worried about expertise being lost in the move. As the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, said, are those staff with particular expertise, drive and enthusiasm going to make the change?</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000042"></a>The postal sector is in as much of a state of flux as the energy sector; perhaps even more so, in the sense that some of what is happening is so much within the Government&#146;s remit, as they decide through whom services should be available. My noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester will speak about post offices in rural areas, so I will not dwell on that issue. I shall simply say that, coming from a rural area, I am reminded weekly&#151;I am not there every day&#151;how much people in such areas rely on those services.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000043"></a>The postal sector is experiencing new operators and service providers coming into the market. Royal Mail is assessing many of its products and services and the changes have seen the introduction of pricing in proportion, for example, and the greater use of automation systems. Such changes mean that consumers need to understand what is happening. With the changes in post office closure times and so forth, they need a strong body to ensure that the information on their effect on consumers is gathered effectively and is then used to inform policy changes.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000044"></a>It is also important to remember that the postal sector deals not only with domestic consumers; there are also business consumers. They too have strong concerns and it would be useful if the Minister could comment on the way in which the new body will relate to the regional agenda. As yet, we have talked mostly in national terms but the pressures in metropolitan and rural areas are different. In the south-west, compared with the south-east, regional bodies will collect different, critical information. I hope that the clause-stand-part debate will enable other Members of the Committee to say how they feel on this issue, and in particular enable the Government to make clear their stand on it.</p>
<h5><a name="07010983000429"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07010983000045"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07010983000452"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I want to speak to the Question whether Clause 15 shall stand part of the Bill. It deals with investigations relating to public post offices. Postwatch has provided an invaluable analysis of the problem the post office network faces not just in rural areas but in many urban deprived areas too, and it has made some important suggestions. It wants investment, tied to reform, in rural post offices to be extended beyond the current cut-off date of April 2008 and for that investment to include urban deprived branches.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70109-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000046"></a>Postwatch makes a strong plea for all structural changes to be driven by customers&#146; needs and undertaken following local consultations with affected communities. It is keen on innovative schemes to enable post office services to be delivered more cost effectively, and it also believes that the Government should make more of their services available at post offices. After all, there is strong evidence that people trust post offices. Nearly 75 per cent of the population would rather deal with the Government via a post office branch than directly. Postwatch&#146;s independent, clear view is extremely welcome and timely and it would be a retrograde step in consumer power if it were to be submerged in a less effective body as regards postal services.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000047"></a>Postwatch has also reviewed the latest rural pilot schemes which focus on the impact on customers, and has made recommendations for improvements. It was, for example, concerned about customers having to wait for a mobile post office van to arrive in the depths of winter in one northerly rural location, and it found that all mobile vans had experienced technical difficulties at some time or other. One problem it highlighted was that faced by disabled customers when a ramp has to be operated by a lone van driver, which is quite a lengthy and time-consuming operation.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000048"></a>Postwatch&#146;s comments are clear and practical and we are not confident that its expertise will be continued if it loses its identity within a new National Consumer Council. What reassurance can the Minister give that this independent view will continue and that consumers, particularly the elderly and disabled, will continue to benefit from this detailed care in looking at all aspects of the consumers&#146; experience with the postal service?</p>

<p><a name="07010983000049"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010983000453"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I declare an interest as chair of the current National Consumer Council. I wish to address the remarks of the noble Baroness in relation to the Question that Clause 15 shall stand part of the Bill, because the inclusion of the clause imposes on the new body the obligation which currently rests with Postwatch to consider post office closures and the plans for changing the post office network. The noble Baroness suggests that this issue will be lost in the new organisation. But the benefit of it being looked at in a wider organisation is that the rural consumers and the deprived urban areas which are losing their post offices suffer from the multiple withdrawal of services, not simply those of the Post Office. The post office has been key in many respects, but they are also losing their local shops, their garages and, in some cases, their pubs. Consumers and many public services are withdrawing to the larger towns.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000050"></a>For all those reasons, post office closures are part of a bigger consumer issue. The expertise of wider consumer areas can be brought to bear, as the noble Baroness said, on creative, innovative solutions in providing those services within rural areas. I therefore suggest to her that putting this matter into a bigger organisation will make it more likely that the concerns of consumers in rural areas will be met. Provided we maintain the expertise of Postwatch within the new organisation rather than confining it to looking at the future of the &#147;post office&#148;&#151;the local post office branch&#151;this may well be part of a bigger and better solution for many rural consumers.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000051"></a>I would very much regret the removal of Clauses 14 and 15 from the Bill because I do not think that would serve the interests of the rural consumers that these amendments purport to represent.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000052"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010983000454"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> Following on from my noble friend I should like to make a further point. There is a view that post offices, particularly rural post offices, are somehow the acme of small retailing. We know that they exist and offer a service but this is very rarely at any inconvenience to the owners of the shops. In some parts of the country, if you go on a Tuesday afternoon you will find that they are closed  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because they work a half-day on a Tuesday. When my wife was collecting the child benefit for our boys on a Saturday because she worked all week, if she was not there by 12.15 she found that the shutters were closed and there was no money available. She did not need to obtain it exclusively from the post offices but a lot of working mum&#146;s do.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000053"></a>There is a new style of retailing&#151;not necessarily 24-hours-a-day-opening&#151;but some of these post offices have got away with retailing murder because of the sentimental affection that a number of their customers had for them. People were kept out of them because it did not suit the purposes of the postmasters and postmistresses to keep their shops open</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000054"></a>Sometimes, where they have mini-supermarkets and the kinds of things to which my noble friend referred&#151;and all power to their elbow&#151;they still shut the post office at 12 o&#146; clock on a Saturday although they keep the rest of the operation going. In my previous constituency, I talked to people who had very successful mini-supermarkets with post offices in them; it was the only way of keeping the post office going. I asked, &#147;Why don&#146;t you open after 12 o&#146;clock or keep the place open after six? This is a small commuting town and people require postal services after their work or after they have done other things at home&#148;. They said, &#147;We never thought about it&#148;. The fact that they had never thought about it was in large measure because the Post Office Counters organisation never really put any pressure on the shopkeepers.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000055"></a>Some closures, not all, are due to property prices. People made more out of selling their shop to someone as a home in a very attractive rural village than they would have made out of running a business, regardless of how much government money was put through in transaction charges and so on. There are many reasons why post office services have contracted in rural areas, but one of them, to which we have given insufficient attention, has been the quality of the service provided for all but those who get out of bed and walk in at 9.30 in the morning. These people are in the minority. Many people would make use of the services if they were open into the evening, as many of the rural shops are at the moment. That is part of a greater concern that the National Consumer Council brings post office services into a proper way of operating.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000056"></a>At the end of the day, post office services are a franchise operation, and the franchisor has given insufficient attention to the retail service needs of the broad spectrum of the community. There is a case to be made for the NCC to shake up the post office services once it looks into the matter. If there is a criticism to be made of Postwatch, it is that it has been too narrowly focused, even though Peter Carr, its previous chairman, was a very distinguished retailer and had a very business-minded approach to the whole area.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000057"></a>Insufficient consideration was given to putting post office services in the context of small-scale community retailing across the board of the kind that is surviving in very difficult circumstances in several areas because outlets are open when people want them to be open  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and provide the services that people need, not necessarily 24/7 but rather longer than from 9 to 5 and perhaps only from 9 to 12 on a Tuesday and a Saturday, as several post offices quite often are. If you stay open for longer, by and large you do more business. That is one rule of retailing that seems to have escaped the attention of several people in the post office lobby.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000058"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010983000455"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for raising the important issues to which these clauses give rise and for the opportunity to reflect on them. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, mentioned the post office network. First, the Government are putting &#163;1.7 billion into supporting the post office network. There is, of course, always a question of how much support the Government should give, but that is a considerable amount of money, and no post offices will close without local consultation. So there is that commitment.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000059"></a>There is no reason why the NCC, which incorporates the functions of Postwatch, should be any less effective. In fact, as my noble friend Lord Whitty said, the Government&#146;s view is that it should be more effective, because here you have one large consumer voice for consumers across a whole range of services. My noble friend made the point about the range of services that people expect from their post office these days. They provide not only postal services but a whole range of other services. My noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill made similar points. I will return to the question of regional networks as I go through the clauses.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000060"></a>Clauses 14 and 15 provide for continuity specifically by preserving key elements of the current arrangements. They confer important powers and duties on the new council to act in the interests of consumers. I should make the point that Clause 5 makes specific provision for the new council to have regard to vulnerable groups, including the elderly and the disabled. Clause 14 enables the new council to bring the full weight of the regulator, the Postal Services Commission, to bear on instances where, for example, the council is concerned that a licence condition has been breached. That is clearly important to correct what might otherwise turn into a long-running delinquent practice by a licence holder that could have adverse consequences for many consumers. At the same time, it is prudent to provide for the council to agree with the Postal Services Commission a description of issues that should be referred by the council to the regulator. That enables the commission to be made aware of those issues that would properly concern it and enables the council to play an important and appropriate role in that process, ultimately to the direct benefit of consumers.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000061"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that it is desirable there should be provision in the Bill for these matters to be brought to the attention of the commission, and that it is in the interests of the commission and the council to agree from time to time on the scope of matters to be referred under this clause.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000062"></a>I turn to Clause 15, which makes specific provision for the new council to have a role in investigating the number and location of public post offices throughout  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the United Kingdom. Clearly, that is currently a key role for Postwatch, and the Committee will be aware of the importance of the role going forward as we consider the restructuring of the post office network, to which I have already referred. That will not change. There will still be a role of oversight to the changes to the post office network.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000063"></a>Under the Government&#146;s proposed strategy for the network, which is currently out to public consultation, restructuring of the post office network will be undertaken on a more strategic and structured basis than previously, within the framework of access criteria to safeguard reasonable access to services in rural and deprived urban areas. It is not just rural areas that badly need postal services and post offices but also deprived urban areas. We should not forget that.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000064"></a>The closure element of the programme will be limited to a maximum of 2,500 offices, as has already been announced. It will include both the urban and rural networks, with rural closures being mitigated at least in part by the outreach programme&#151;about 500 offices or facilities being offered.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000065"></a>Postwatch, in its current form, will have a significant role to play in developing proposals for closures and outreach in each area. The restructuring and closure programme will be completed by late 2008, and should therefore be completed&#151;or very largely so&#151;before Postwatch merges with the new council.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000066"></a>Returning to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, I mention regional committees. I know that Postwatch values highly the work of its regional committees, as do the Government. That is why the Bill makes specific provision in Schedule 1 for the council to establish regional committees. There is no set number of committees which may be established under that provision: if we thought of a number today, it would inevitably be arbitrary, and a greater or smaller number of regional committees may be needed over time. Regional committees established by the council would be able to cover all consumer issues, not just postal services or energy as we have now.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000067"></a>I wanted only to emphasise that there is no prejudice against regional committees, and that the Bill makes a sensible and flexible provision to enable the council to fulfil any regional remit in an appropriate way to the benefit of consumers.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000076"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 and join the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, in offering our very best wishes for 2007 from these Benches.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000077"></a>This group of amendments is intended to probe the role of the Secretary of State in relation to the new NCC. Amendment No. 70 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to publish any report submitted to him by the council. That is a matter of transparency. Where the NCC is providing reports on various matters, it is appropriate that those reports be made available to the consumer. In fact, I cannot think of a reason why that should not happen, unless there is to be some specific relationship between the NCC and the Secretary of State of which we are unaware that precludes giving information to the public. I should be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to that.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000078"></a>Amendment No. 75 takes the issue further by proposing to ensure that where the Secretary of State makes appointments to the NCC under the provisions in Clause 19(2)(d) in relation to co-operation arrangements, he will have a duty to consult those interest groups that will be affected by the appointment.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000079"></a>Amendment No. 76 would reinforce Amendment No. 75 by ensuring that where a co-operation arrangement is made, the NCC would provide a memorandum of that appointment no later than six months following the arrangement.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000080"></a>This package of amendments is important, and especially so in the context of the Government&#146;s record on the independence, or, rather, lack of it, of non-departmental public bodies. I am sure that Members of the Committee will recall the reports in the media within the past few weeks regarding the make-up of the Big Lottery Fund and the Commission for Equality and Human Rights. Those reports have exposed a worrying precedent, whereby supposedly independent bodies are open to manipulation by government appointments and directions.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000081"></a>The NCC is a body about consumers and for consumers. We on these Benches appreciate why the Government would want to bring its achievements closer to the process of government policy making. It is testament to what I might call the &#147;old&#148; NCC&#146;s achievements that the Government wish to capitalise on its expertise. These amendments across the board seek to preserve that expertise and the independence that has reinforced it over the past 30 years. I beg to move.</p>

I am at a wee bit of a loss to know why this subsection is in the Bill because you would imagine that if you request information, you then have the chance to publish it. So why do we need to have Parliament&#146;s permission in the form of granting the Government the right to publish if they so wish? It seems a rather unnecessary amendment. If the subsection is intended not to give the council the power to publish but, because of the existence of the word &#147;may&#148;, to give it the power to refuse to publish, we are talking about something else; we are  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>talking about giving the Government the power to waste the National Consumer Council&#146;s time in getting it to produce a report which one would imagine would be of interest to more than Ministers and the Secretary of State. It is one of those pieces of meaningless verbiage which find their way into Bills because they have always done so. Therefore, I would have thought you either have the provision &#147;must&#148;, or you do not have the subsection at all.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000083"></a>If the National Consumer Council has some plus points&#151;and I think that it has&#151;one of the areas where it has been very influential is in producing well thought-out and well considered reports, which have on occasions moved forward discussions and government thinking. But if the reports are that worthy and that important, as I think probably they would be, it is not unreasonable that the rest of us should have access to them and that they should be published by the Minister.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000084"></a>In some respects the Bill would be none the worse if subsection (2) was not present. But it is and in the form that it is written it is unhelpful. It could be a form of embarrassment to the Government and it would be better if they had &#147;must&#148;. If they do not want &#147;must&#148;, at another time and in another place it would be simpler just to withdraw the subsection.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000085"></a>I realise that we are not pushing the amendment to a vote, and I am merely trying to be helpful to my noble friend because I think that this is the kind of issue that is just storing up trouble for the future. The nasty people along the other end of the building would have great sport with a piece of sloppy legislative drafting of this nature, and the Bill would be none the worse without it. But if we are going to have it, it ought to be &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;. There is a danger that a cynical Secretary of State in another administration might well take the opportunity that this subsection affords to involve the National Consumer Council in needless work to which we, the public and politicians, would never have access, because there would be no obligation on the Government to publish it.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000086"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010983000458"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I, like my colleague and noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, find it curious that subsection (2) should be here at all. It states only that the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; publish; surely there is no need to require the Government to publish a report for which they have specifically asked&#151;but I do not see much point in the amendment, either. As my noble friend indicated, the National Consumer Council has over the years published numerous reports, and he, who has been critical of that organisation in the past, none the less admits that many of those reports were of value. My point is simply that there is hardly a need to insert &#147;must&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148;, because the National Consumer Council could publish the reports as it wishes and that has been common practice. I know that this may sound unhelpful: I see neither the point of the Government&#146;s subsection, nor any point in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000088"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07010983000460"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> We are envisaging a situation where the National Consumer Council, having been asked by the Government to produce a report, does not wish it to be published. It is a rather incredible notion that someone who has worked on a report would wish to keep it secret. That hardly needs to be considered. I suppose that the remote possibility being imagined by the noble Baroness could have happened at any time in the past, whereby the NCC started work on a subject and then perhaps realised that it would cause such an unfortunate impression of the NCC that it did not want to publish a report. That is difficult to imagine, but if that were the case, it could have happened in the past and it could happen in the future.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000089"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07010983000461"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> I must pursue this for a further moment. There have been examples, not in relation to the National Consumer Council, where advice has been given to Government and demands have been made for that to be published. Not everything has been done in the interests of complete openness. I feel that that could well happen and if a report is made to Government there really should be an onus for it to be published.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000090"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07010983000462"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> These amendments relate to the council&#146;s functions outlined in Clauses 17 and 19 and to the actions that fall to the Secretary of State and the council in that respect. Following the points made by my noble friends Lord O&#146;Neill and Lord Borrie, the Government agree that it could have been left unsaid and that we did not need to publish these reports, but we considered that it would be more transparent to show that reports under Clauses 16 and 17 may be published, although there is not a duty to publish, either. That was the Government&#146;s view.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000091"></a>Clause 17 gives the Secretary of State the power to require the council to prepare and submit reports on any matter. This is seen as complementary to the council&#146;s other functions; in particular, the requirement for it to prepare, publish and consult on a draft forward work programme for each financial year and to consider any representations made in response to that consultation. We envisage that this process would ensure that the council captures all known issues of key importance to consumers. However&#151;and this is a central point&#151;from time to time other consumer issues may arise that are judged important enough to the consumer interest to warrant further attention. In those circumstances the Secretary of State would be able to call on the expertise of the council to prepare and submit a report. That is the basic thinking behind these clauses. Such a report could then be used to assist all concerned with making an informed decision regarding what further action, if any, is needed on the issue.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000092"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 70 would be to place a duty on the Secretary of State to publish all reports submitted by the council under this clause irrespective  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of whether they are of wider interest or relevance. In practice, the Secretary of State will work closely with the council and others in coming to decisions about what would be appropriate in each circumstance. The current drafting allows for the discretion needed to consider when publication is necessary or desirable. Unnecessary publication costs which might otherwise have been avoided could be incurred, which addresses the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain. If the word &#147;shall&#148; is used, there would be an obligation to publish which might not be appropriate in all circumstances and certainly could be very costly. In the light of my explanation, I hope that noble Lords will understand why the Government do not feel inclined to support the amendment.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000093"></a>Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 relate to Clause 19 which requires the council and the designated bodies referred to in this clause to enter into co-operation arrangements and includes provisions relating to such arrangements. These co-operation arrangements are intended to encourage effective communication channels and collaborative working, and to provide an effective interface between the council and others where functions and responsibilities coincide or overlap. Over time it may be necessary to consider whether to widen the co-operation agreements to include other bodies. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State may designate other persons to be subject to these provisions. Amendment No. 75 would in effect require the Secretary of State to consult on a decision to require the council to enter into co-operation arrangements with new designated persons. After careful consideration of the amendment, I am not convinced that such a formal duty is necessary. In practice, the Secretary of State will work closely with the council and others prior to making an order adding a person to the list of designated bodies for the purposes of this clause. The imposition of a formal duty to consult could cause delays and such an intention would in any event most likely be included in the council&#146;s forward work programme.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000094"></a>Amendment No. 76 addresses Clause 19(4) which requires the council and a designated body to prepare a memorandum setting out the co-operation arrangements as soon as practicable after agreement is reached on these arrangements. The amendment restricts this to a period of no more than six months after agreement is reached. After careful consideration, we are not aware of any reasons why in practice the council and the designated bodies would not prepare the memorandum of agreement as soon as practicable, and there may be instances where there are good reasons why that could not be achieved within a six-month period. The imposition of a time limit could therefore result in a breach being incurred, but one that had been incurred for a good reason.</p>

These amendments are intended to elicit the precise functions of Clauses 23 and 27. Clause 23 enables the National Consumer Council to order any service provider, the Office of Fair Trading, a designated regulator or any other person specified by the Secretary of State to provide information as would be specified in a notice given under subsection (1). The clause is reinforced by Clause 25 which enables the NCC to apply for an order through the courts to enforce the giving of information and paying of costs incurred during the process should any of the parties fail to provide the information required by a notice under Clause 23. Clause 27 enables the Secretary of State to issue regulations which exempt parties from providing information.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000118"></a>While Members on these Benches believe that the NCC should have the power to extract information from relevant groups in the carrying out of its functions, it seems that the combined effect of Clauses 23 and 27 represents a case of using a rather clumsy sledgehammer to crack a nut, especially in respect of smaller businesses that provide services. I am concerned too that Clause 27, which provides exemptions from giving information to the NCC, could frustrate the effectiveness of the council. Once regulations are made preventing the giving of information, they will be very difficult to reverse, and it concerns me that circumstances could arise where,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while it is important to have access to information, that access could be curtailed by the Secretary of State&#146;s regulations. Indeed, the principle of Clause 27 seems to go against the principle of Clause 23.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000119"></a>I would be grateful to the Minister if he could inform Members of the Committee of the types of information he expects the Secretary of State to withhold from the NCC and whether regulations will contain caveats where extenuating circumstances would justify the giving of that information. I was pleased to see that Clause 23 includes a caveat that encourages minimising costs, yet there is no corresponding caveat in Clause 25. Clause 23(5) states that the NCC must,</p>
<ul><a name="07010983000422"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of minimising costs, or any other detriment, to the person to whom the notice is to be given&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000393"></a>But where an order is made under Clause 25 to force a company or person to provide information who has not already done so, subsection (4) of the clause states that an order could force the defaulter to pay all the costs or expenses of the process.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000120"></a>Could there be a case where the National Consumer Council requires information from a person and fails to have actual regard to the need to minimise costs, and the person is simply unable to provide the information due to the cost? The provisions under Clause 25 could then result in an unfair financial burden on the so-called defaulter. The answer may be to come back with an amendment on Report to tighten the duty of the NCC to ensure that costs are not extortionate. I would be grateful if the Minister explained what penalties the NCC would suffer if costs incurred by Clause 23 were extortionate, and what thresholds he envisages would constitute unreasonable costs imposed on a regulator, an individual service provider or the OFT.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000122"></a>If the council requests information from the OFT, or a designated regulator, which then fails to provide the information requested, the council may require the OFT or the designated regulator to provide a notice setting out the reasons for that failure. The council may publish that notice. This also replicates the current arrangements between Energywatch and Postwatch and respective sectoral regulators.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000123"></a>We anticipate that in practice the new council is likely to rely on the quality of existing relationships built up by Energywatch, Postwatch and the existing National Consumer Council with their stakeholders, and on high quality and responsible consumer advocacy to obtain information, rather than have to resort to formal procedures. In many cases, the existence of the powers will be enough to encourage provision of information. However, examples where the new council

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000124"></a>There are also safeguards to the exercise of this power. The council cannot request information that is unrelated to its functions. Further, the council must consider the impact that the request for information will have on the person to whom the request is made, and be mindful of the desirability of minimising the cost or any other detriment that the request might cause. That partly answers the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. With regard to the exemptions, the sort of information that may come under the overall umbrella would be issues like national security or commercially sensitive information.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000125"></a>Information cannot be required that a person could not be compelled to provide in legal proceedings, such as information subject to legal professional privilege. Clause 28 provides that the protections in Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002 on disclosure of information will also apply.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000126"></a>Clause 27 provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying exemptions from the requirement to provide information to or by the council in relation to persons to whom the notice may not be given&#151;information which a person may refuse to supply, for example, or circumstances in which a person may refuse to comply with such a notice on the grounds of national security or commercial confidentiality, as I have just mentioned. That balances the power to request information and replicates existing powers in the energy and postal services sectors.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000127"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue. For the reasons I have given, however, I am not convinced that these amendments represent the best way forward in terms of the new council&#146;s ability to carry out its functions effectively and efficiently to represent the interests of consumers.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000403"></a> Clause 29, page 16, line 43, leave out subsection (2)</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000145"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 100 would prevent the abolishment of Postwatch and is intended as a probing amendment. I note that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has tabled a Motion to oppose Clause 29 standing part of the Bill. While I look forward to hearing what she has to say, I reserve judgment until I hear the Minister&#146;s response on the wisdom of merging Postwatch with the new NCC. The question of Energywatch will be addressed in our amendments to Clauses 42, 48 and 49, Energywatch and Postwatch being two different organisations.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000146"></a>We are concerned on several counts about the merger of Postwatch into the NCC. It is vital that consumer voice<I></I>does not result in a dilution of the sector-specific expertise essential in postal services. This is particularly important for the postal services market, which has only recently been opened up to competition. The role of Postwatch has been vital in ensuring that the interests of all consumers of mail services are upheld in this uncertain and changing marketplace. It is essential that consumer voice continues to represent businesses in the same way as Postwatch has done. The fundamental changes taking place within Royal Mail and within the market overall are affecting and will continue to affect all businesses, no matter what their size. It is therefore imperative that there is an effective voice for businesses dependent on mail services.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000147"></a>We should not forget that an effective consumer voice is also an essential sounding board for the sector regulator. I am sure that Members of the Committee will have taken great interest in the Statement repeated by the Minister in your Lordships' House before Christmas. In our response to it, we welcomed the Government&#146;s U-turn on post office card accounts, but unfortunately that is all we have to welcome in the Government&#146;s policy on post offices. There was no real answer on the anticipated effects on rural post offices, or inner city ones. The Minister guaranteed that 95 per cent of the rural population would be within one mile of a post office but did not identify whether that would be a post office in the traditional sense of one open every day of the week or whether that figure would include the new outreach programmes. I should be grateful if he could expand on that point.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000148"></a>This matter is close to our hearts. My noble friend Lady Byford made a valuable contribution to the debate on the Statement, and I had hoped that she would be able to make a contribution this afternoon. In the light of the fundamental changes being made to postal services and the vast reductions being made in the number of post offices, which will affect not only small local businesses but also the most vulnerable consumers, I should be grateful if the Minister could present his own forward work plan for consumer services under the new Postwatch arm of the NCC and say whether it will do as much as Postwatch has done&#151;or, indeed, more for consumers using postal services. I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07010983000149"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07010983000467"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I have a feeling that we have been around the houses on this one either with regard to energy or to postal services. I thought that my noble friend Lord Whitty made the key point earlier: as long as the specific expertise in the particular segmented consumer bodies is not lost, there are advantages in the bodies coming together within the umbrella of the National Consumer Council because the NCC has a larger role for consumers generally. It can bring to the table a power of knowledge and advocacy which is broader than the other bodies.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000150"></a>There probably would not have been separate consumer bodies in those different fields if it there had not been different legislation at different stages of parliamentary life that required such consumer advocacy bodies to be created. There was the same position with regulators. We had separate regulators for gas, electricity and the other privatised industries because the legislation did not come forward at one moment but at different points of time. Now, later, one can look back and see whether a bringing together of either the regulatory bodies, or, in this case, the consumer bodies, is desirable. I think that the Government have made a very good case for saying that that is desirable in the particular instances proposed in the Bill. We have discussed the matter of merger several times. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made the case earlier, but I think that it has been answered.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000151"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010983000468"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I shall not repeat the comments I made in speaking to whether the clause stand part but merely say that those concerns are there. I ask the Minister to elucidate further on the position for business customers under the new arrangements. Postwatch has been particularly active recently on one issue that has concerned a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises. That of course is the new PIP introduction&#151;pricing in proportion to the size of your mail&#151;which has affected a lot of enterprises. What assurances can the Minister give to business customers about their essential postal services? In this great day of the internet, people think that so much business is done by e-mail, as indeed it is, but an awful lot of businesses still rely very heavily on postal services for one reason or another.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000152"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07010983000469"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> On Amendment No. 100, in the name of the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilcox and Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. I am most grateful to them for giving us the chance to debate one of the most fundamental objectives of the Bill&#151;the creation of a stronger cross-sectoral consumer advocacy body to address consumer issues that frequently arise across sectors of the economy.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000153"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about business customers, there is no reason why they should receive an inferior service under the NCC. In fact, I think that they will receive a superior service. Of course, business customers have the opportunity to shop around these days if they are not satisfied with the service or the price that the Post Office is offering them. The whole point of the new structure of the NCC is that complaints will be dealt with just as they are dealt with currently. There will be  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no diminution of the representational functions of the postal sector or its role in dealing with complaints. </p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, mentioned access to post offices and asked whether the clauses refer to actual post offices or simply to outlets. I refer him to one of the consultation documents published around the time of the Statement, which stated categorically that 99 per cent of the population will be within three miles of an outlet, and that nine out of 10 people will be within one mile of an outlet. So they refer to outlets, not to a temporary service.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000155"></a>We propose that the new body will have the critical mass to engage effectively with government, regulators and industry sectors on the basis of expert and informed analysis, and with the benefit of being able to draw on experience and expertise across several sectors. The responsibility and authority to speak for consumers would rest with a single organisation, thus providing a stronger and more effective policy voice in the UK and the EU, as I have already said.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000156"></a>Initially, the new council will take over most of the functions and duties of Energywatch, Postwatch and the existing National Consumer Council. Other consumer bodies are not included initially in recognition of the recent reforms to consumer representation in some sectors, such as water and rail, or where there is no need, such as in financial services and electronic communications. These latter sectors already follow the model that we are proposing for energy and postal services, which have a single point for consumers to access help and advice in the form of Consumer Direct. I already made that point to my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan, so I shall not repeat it.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000157"></a>It is important to note that the new council will represent consumers across all markets; there are no caveats for any sectors. Amendment No. 100 would prevent the abolition of Postwatch and would therefore deny consumers in the postal services sector the benefit of having a stronger, more coherent consumer advocate to represent their interests. I understand that some noble Lords are particularly concerned that the postal services sector needs a stronger consumer advocacy body to represent consumer interests in relation to post office closures. I agree with my noble friend Lord Borrie that we have already covered most of these issues, but I should say that in recognition of the importance of this issue to consumers, the council will maintain the current function assigned to Postwatch to investigate any matter relating to the number and location of public post offices under Clause 15.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000158"></a>Postal services consumers will also benefit from the introduction of redress schemes to ensure the resolution of complaints and to provide compensation or other forms of redress where warranted. Postwatch does not have the statutory functions to do that&#151;and rightly so&#151;so the Government are introducing a redress mechanism that must be independent from both parties involved in a complaint to ensure that the decisions reached on each case are fair and impartial. There is currently no such redress mechanism. If that proposal was voted down, we would be removing the option of redress that the Government propose and which consumers do not have under the existing set-up.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000165"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendments would remove from the Bill the reserve power to bring the Consumer Council for Water under the National Consumer Council. Their purpose is to probe the Government on why the Consumer Council for Water is to be included in this body.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000166"></a>Amendment No. 101 is more than a probing amendment. I will lay out arguments as to why we feel it is insufficient to put a date into the Bill by order. At the very least the Bill should contain the earliest date&#151;a &#147;not before date&#148;&#151;by which this should happen. The other amendments are consequential on the removal of the Consumer Council for Water from the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000167"></a>Some four years ago, when the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was the Minister, we sat in this very Room and debated the setting-up of the Consumer Council for Water. The noble Lord made a very good case as to why we should set up the body and the Government subsequently did so at a cost of about &#163;1 million&#151;and very good value it has been to date.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000168"></a>There are three mechanisms driving the world of water. One mechanism is the pricing round overseen by the regulator, Ofwat, and another is the water framework directive which aims to bring all water up to a qualitative standard by 2015 in the first round. The directive also addresses some of the issues of quantity and use of water. It is, of course, a European directive but it was initiated in the UK and subsequently taken through Europe. The third mechanism is the issue of climate change, which has put more pressure on the difficult balance between the consumer&#146;s need for water, which has increased over recent decades, water-hungry appliances and the now much more appreciated need for enough water to sustain the natural environment so that biodiversity is not affected in our wetlands and to sustain an adequate river flow. The complexities surrounding water are many.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000169"></a>A very distinct timeline has been drawn out and there is an interaction between the water framework directive and the pricing rounds. I asked the Consumer  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council for Water to draw up a timeline showing what it would be doing at each stage. Its reply runs to five pages and so I shall not read it out in extreme detail. It shows how essential is the involvement of the Consumer Council for Water in both the pricing round and in the water framework directive&#146;s implementation.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000170"></a>I remind the Minister&#151;I am sure he knows&#151;that the water framework directive contains a provision which requires public involvement. It cannot simply be left to the Environment Agency to involve panels of the usual suspects. It needs a strong consumer voice running all the way through the implementation of the water framework directive.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000171"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to an important date. Draft river basin management plans will be published for public consultation in December 2008. That process will run for a year until 2009, when the final plans are published and will have a formal response. The importance of that directive, and of getting both it and the consumers&#146; input into it right, means that the CCW should not be messed around with before that date.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000172"></a>In parallel with that is the pricing round. In January 2010 companies will, for example, be deciding whether they will appeal to the Competition Commission on the price limits put on them in 2009. That pricing round will almost be finished, but not quite, and until 2009 the CCW&#146;s input into that round will be critical. We have only to look back over the past year to see consumers being asked to use much less water, hosepipe bans, leakage rates being highlighted and so on. It is a very important balance. The regulator, Philip Fletcher, has furnished us with a copy of his letter to the Minister asking that the CCW be free to concentrate on fulfilling its remit over the next few years.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000173"></a>The Government still have to make the case for incorporating the CCW into the NCC at all, but if they do so, if the Minister looks at the timeline, there is a moment of calm, after one pricing round, when the water framework directive is being implemented but does not have any of those important crunch points. That would be at the end of 2011, which is why I have chosen that year for my amendment. I suggest that any order that the Government are thinking of making to incorporate the CCW should not be made before that date.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000174"></a>I would be interested to hear the comments of other Members of the Committee who have a great deal of expertise on the issue of the CCW and the water regime. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000176"></a>Amendment No. 101 deals with timing, and it is that which I shall specifically refer to. The question is, after all, whether the consumer will be best represented in the very special case of water, compared with personal

Will he be better served by allowing the Consumer Council for Water to be subsumed within the new council in 2008, as the Bill would allow, or should there be provision, as in Amendment No. 101, that the process cannot start until 2011? The case is very strong because of the special circumstances of water. I am not suggesting that ultimately there will not be a case for bringing the water sector within the council&#146;s remit. The probing amendments give the Minister an opportunity to make that case, but the case for delaying any deliberation on this issue until 2011 is very convincing.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000177"></a>Let us remind ourselves that the consumers are not greatly enamoured with the water sector. You have only to remember the press this summer about drought orders, the water companies&#146; return on capital, which some saw as excessive, and the implications of environmental impacts, not least with the water framework directive. These and other issues created a lot of public interest. There has been consistent extreme criticism, not just of the role of Ofwat in trying to monitor the price limits for the water companies but also of the Environment Agency. It needed the Consumer Council for Water, which came into existence only in October 2005, with its new statutory powers, to bring consumers into a position where they could influence much more directly the regulatory roles of Ofwat and the Environment Agency.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000178"></a>Many of us&#151;including the Select Committee on Science and Technology, which I was privileged to chair, and which produced a report in June 2006&#151;came to the conclusion that, in the admittedly short time that the Consumer Council for Water had then been in existence, it had started to bring the consumer more centrally into deliberations on how our water should better be managed for long-term continuity of supply and to get much better consumer ownership of the clear problems about how demand can be curtailed. For example, why do we use 160 litres of water per capita when other countries in Europe, our neighbours, with standards of living which are not dramatically different, appear to manage with a lower consumption per capita?</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000179"></a>Those are issues which we will never resolve unless consumers can buy into the issues. When they see leakages in the streets and hear that some water companies have a leakage rate of 30 per cent or more, it is not surprising that they do not buy into it. Perhaps it has to be admitted from these Benches that the privatisation process did, indeed, cause further lack of ownership.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000180"></a>The Consumer Council for Water has clearly got off to a good start. It is trying to ensure that the consumer is properly represented, not just in the day-to-day issues about vulnerable communities or water supply and drought orders, but in looking at the medium-term issues of the water framework directive and the issues about the next round of price levels for water. It would be a great mistake to take an organisation which, after all, has only been in existence for 15 months or so and to suggest in the Bill that it has to be subsumed into the new council as early as 2008 or thereabouts.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000181"></a>If the Minister can find it in himself to give the assurance that Amendment No. 101 stands and that there is a time limit before which nothing will happen, it will give an enormous assurance to the consumers, some of whom might well see the advantage ultimately of water being treated in the same way as other consumer bodies. However, it would be a great mistake at this stage not to listen very carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and to give favourable consideration to Amendment No. 101.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000182"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010983000473"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I support the Bill on this issue. I am always very dubious about people&#151;it is usually Ministers&#151;trailing the doctrine of unripe time as the justification for doing nothing. If we got anywhere near 2009 or 2010 there would be compelling arguments to take the matter on to 2014 or 2015 or beyond.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000183"></a>We must recognise that the technical functions of our consumer body are limited. They are important, but they are not the only functions. By technical here, I mean matters related only to water. On issues related to the pricing round, Energywatch, Postwatch and the National Consumer Council will bring far more to the table than an individual consumer body. Given that, on the pricing issue, a stronger, broader, deeper consumer protection body would better be able to deal with this.</p>
<h5><a name="07010983000434"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000184"></a>It is certainly the case that until fairly recently the water watchdog has not been particularly effective at protecting consumers in England, and even with the powers it has had since 2005 there are still many problems. So in highlighting the difficulties of the water consumer, particularly in relation to price, I do not think it has all that strong a record, one worth protecting as we move into the next negotiating round. For example, the rigour with which Postwatch has dealt with the postal pricing issue will stand it in good stead.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000185"></a>On the question of Euro consultation, Energywatch in particular has a very substantial relationship with its European counterparts. A lot of work has been done on issues related to the energy directives, so the idea that only water watchdogs can look after water matters in Europe is not valid. Half or perhaps even two-thirds of the issues related to working the European system are all about understanding that system, so what you are actually dealing with does not really matter in some respects because engaging with the Commission and the extended bureaucracy in Brussels is the important issue. It is not always a question of the issues themselves.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000186"></a>On the issue of climate change, this is a kind of last-gasp excuse. We cannot tell ourselves that Energywatch has not been concerned with climate change. Indeed, on her own admission the noble Baroness has acknowledged that climate change as an issue has been written on the blackboard only relatively recently. Broader climate change concerns have certainly been included in the remit of the energy consumer watchdog.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000187"></a>What I am trying to get at here is that the three fundamental points made by the noble Baroness do not really have much substance when we set the role of a single consumer protection body against a broader one that brings in a range of expertise which, while not water-specific, would nevertheless include within it the water element. That is because no one is suggesting that all those working for the consumer watchdogs are going to be thrown out into the street.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000188"></a>A further point has not been addressed here&#151;that of the monopoly character of the water industry and the need to have as broad and strong a range of expertise as possible to challenge the abuse of monopoly powers by the water companies. Again, a case can be made for a strong and effective national body to take on the water companies which for years have been running rings around Ofwat and the consumer protection body. Indeed, by the noble Earl&#146;s own admission consumers are not happy with the water industry, one which has not greatly improved since 2005, although it has to be said that the consumer body has done good work in the intervening period. But an awful lot remains to be done and I am not sure if the resources of the existing consumer body are sufficient to meet the challenges ahead. A broader based and more effective organisation would, in my view, have a role to play.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000189"></a>What I am saying comes down to this: I wish that water would be brought in sooner rather than later, not simply for bureaucratic tidiness but because the water consumer deserves better and could be better served by a water consumer body operating as part of a larger organisation. While the case that has been advanced may superficially appear to be compelling, I do not think it is a good one.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000190"></a>As to the idea that we should simply wait until the existing challenges are out of the way when it will be okay to bring it into the larger body, there is never going to be an ideal time for any change in this area; there are always going to be other excuses. The case made by my noble friend Lord Whitty, the chair of the existing National Consumer Council, is the most compelling. We will have a concentration of expertise across a range of consumer protection disciplines that will be able to take on the particular challenges of the water industry.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000191"></a>This is not about Europe or regulatory pricing but about a natural monopoly. It is one with which we have to live but which we have to challenge to ensure that it is continually harassed to ensure that consumers get a reasonable deal, or at least a better deal than they have had so far. The existing Water Consumer Council, although it has improved and has received additional powers, has not been able to protect people. Therefore, along with the other consumer bodies that will be subsumed by the new National Consumer Council, the English water consumers will get a better deal if, as soon as possible, they are brought under the umbrella of that new body.</p>

I am grateful to Members of the Committee for enabling us to debate this important issue, which focuses on the core objectives of the Bill to create a stronger, cross-sectoral consumer advocacy body while making consumer representation and redress simpler but more effective for the consumer.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000193"></a>Clauses 30, 31 and 32 concern the potential inclusion of the Consumer Council for Water in the new arrangements at some point in the future. Bringing the water sector within the scope of the new arrangements would only happen after proper public consultation and only if the results of that consultation showed that consumers in the water sector would receive real benefits from coming within the new arrangements. Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 would remove the water sector from Part 2 of the Bill. This would have the effect of removing the possibility of extending redress schemes to the water sector even after consultation in 2008. So, in effect, there would be no form of redress for consumers in that area.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000194"></a>Our intention is to strengthen consumer representation and redress by extending redress schemes to the water sector to ensure that consumers benefit from complaint resolution rather than simply complaint handling. Only independent redress schemes which can award redress&#151;such as an explanation, an apology or compensation as appropriate&#151;and whose decisions are binding on suppliers can offer consumers certainty of complaint resolution.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000195"></a>I listened carefully to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, but Amendment No. 101 is all about seeking to delay the consultation on the inclusion of the water sector until 2011. This may not necessarily be in the best interests of consumers. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, also focused on the timeline. My right honourable friend Ian McCartney MP has agreed to meet with Ofwat and the CCW to discuss the timescale for water in this regard.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000196"></a>The public consultation held by my department earlier this year sought views on the best time to consider the question of the inclusion of the water sector in the new arrangements. Some respondents agreed with the noble Baroness that the consultation should be later than the proposed date of 2008. However, many other respondents believed that the water sector should be included from the outset. There was a whole range of views.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000197"></a>We took the view at the end of that consultation that we would consult on the inclusion of the water sector in 2008. That recognises that the Consumer Council for Water needs time to establish itself and to start to tackle the new, important objectives that it has been given. However, consulting in 2008 will provide for a timely assessment of consumer representation in the water sector, to ensure that consumers in this sector benefit from the most effective system of consumer representation and redress available. If incorporated, the new NCC would take over the functions of the CCW and could be a stronger advocate for consumers than the current body. I refer to the points that my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan made earlier. If it was incorporated into the NCC, it would  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of course maintain the existing sector expertise which currently the CCW has. All these issues are being discussed. Consultation is ongoing. I am giving the Committee the logic behind the Government&#146;s position after an extensive consultation on the timeline. That is how we arrived at the point we are at today.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000198"></a>Moving on to Amendment No. 115, Clause 46 relates to orders that may be made by the Secretary of State requiring regulated suppliers to belong to a redress scheme. The amendment suggests that subsection (5) of Clause 46 is removed from the Bill. Subsection (5) provides that the consent of Welsh Ministers must be obtained before the Secretary of State can, by order, require a regulated supplier in the water sector for an area which is wholly or mainly in Wales to belong to a redress scheme. The Water Industry Act 1991, as amended by the Water Act 2003, devolves to the National Assembly for Wales certain interests in respect of water. The Government of Wales Act 2006 will transfer these functions to Welsh Ministers. It is likely that the power to require water and sewerage undertakers in Wales to belong to a redress scheme may affect devolved matters in Wales. I believe that it is appropriate to obtain the consent of Welsh Ministers when dealing with certain issues in relation to the water sector.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000199"></a>For the reasons I have given, I am not convinced that the proposed amendments represent the best way forward for consumers in the water sector at this point. Therefore, I support the retention of Clauses 30, 31 and 32.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000200"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07010983000475"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I thank the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for his support. His committee produced a very interesting report into water management, so he has recently been exposed to a particularly large amount of evidence on this issue.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000201"></a>I was quite surprised by the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, in one respect. He accused me of saying that we should wait for ever, and he said that there would never be an ideal time. I accept that there will never be an ideal time, but I suggested a specific time related to the pricing round and the timing of the water framework directive. Far from saying that it should be delayed for ever, I suggested to the Government that that would be the most ideal time if this move was going to be made. So I am not at all guilty of the accusation that he levelled at me.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000202"></a>I think that the DTI has slightly missed the point here. One of the reasons the Consumer Council for Water was set up under the Water Act, which of course was a Defra Act so I do not think that many of the officials will have been party to these discussions, was to balance the interests of the environment and the users of water that used a tap as opposed to swimming in it as fishes or anything else. When we talk of consumers, it is assumed that we mean human consumers, but a whole other part of creation uses water.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000203"></a>That is why the balance is so important. The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, says that CCW has not batted particularly hard on behalf of the consumer. However, those consumers concerned with the environment feel  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that part of CCW&#146;s job, as defined under the Water Act, was to bat for the environment as well and to be part of weighing up the balance. It is not all about the price. Of course that is important, but that is part of the regulator's job, which is why it is important that there is a knowledgeable consumer voice on the water framework directive which will ask people to manage their water environment in an entirely different way.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0004.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000204"></a>In summary, I am not convinced that the Government have yet got the message but I am very heartened that the Minister&#146;s colleague, Mr McCartney, will be meeting the regulator. I wonder whether that meeting is likely to take place before Report so that, should we feel moved to ask the opinion of the House on the matter, the Government will be able to tell us about its outcome. We will then see whether that will be necessary. I hope that the Minister is nodding, so I hope that it will be before Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, I am delighted to move Amendment No. 111 and speak to the other amendments included in the group. This group of amendments seeks to strengthen the complaints handling procedure following the merger of Postwatch and Energywatch under the new umbrella body, Consumer Direct.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000236"></a>Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 go hand in hand to strengthen the provisions of Clause 42. Currently the clause allows regulators to make regulations to prescribe standards when handling complaints. However, one of the major concerns of the outgoing Energywatch is that there will not be adequate protection for those consumers facing the cut-off of their electricity supply. Amendment No. 114 would prevent the Secretary of State running a redress scheme or appointing a body to run such a scheme. This is a probing amendment to discover the Government&#146;s policy on whether a redress scheme would be controlled by central government. I would have thought it important to ensure that a redress scheme is approved by the relevant regulator who will be independent of central government and have detailed knowledge of consumers&#146; needs.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000237"></a>Amendment No. 116 seeks to remove the reference to &#147;relevant consumers&#148;. All consumers using energy supplies are relevant where redress schemes are concerned. Amendment No. 117 changes the remit of what a regulator must consider in creating a redress scheme, raising the bar of performance from &#147;good&#148; practice to &#147;best&#148; practice. I am sure that the Minister has a good reason for setting the standard for a redress scheme at &#147;good&#148; practice. &#147;Good&#148; is good enough for most people, yet I should be interested to know why he does not aim for the best in this Bill. Our idea of best practice is where consumers can make rapid contact with the ombudsman instead of the current three-month wait and where recognised complaint handling procedures are a requirement for entry on to the scheme.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000238"></a>Amendment No. 119 fulfils the need to have approved standards for complaint handling procedures, while Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 ensure that the regulator would have to take into account the handling of individual complaints when designing a redress scheme.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000239"></a>Along with all noble Lords, I welcome the proposal for an ombudsman in these markets, but I am concerned about the future treatment of those consumers who need more than the simple advice that Consumer Direct can provide and who cannot afford to wait months for an ombudsman scheme to make a deliberation. Last year, Energywatch took 63,000 complaints, and followed up a further 223,000 issues directly with companies on behalf of consumers. Energy problems can be complex and urgent, so I find it hard to see how diminished support and longer waiting times represent a step forward in consumer services. I am concerned about what will happen to a consumer who has been threatened with having the gas supply cut off after March 2008. It is my understanding that the current Bill would require the new consumer body only to deal with those who have already been disconnected. At present, Energywatch intervenes when a consumer is at risk of being disconnected or is without an energy supply for other reasons. It is vital that Consumer Direct has access to good quality complaints data, to basic intelligence about what is going wrong in markets and how that affects consumers.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000240"></a>Indeed, I should be interested to know how consumer problems are to be dealt with in the interim transition. The Bill reorganises five bodies, will make  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hundreds of dedicated members of staff redundant and require complex transactions that will confuse consumers as well as reducing help and support for them. A &#163;9 million saving is admirable, but I should be interested to take a note of the final collateral costs involved in staff payoffs and extra funds spent on the more complex processing of consumer complaints during the transition.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000241"></a>The Minister kindly hosted a meeting for myself and my noble friend Lord De Mauley in advance of the debate on Second Reading at which he said he did not have the exact figures for redundancies to be made during the merger. His officials mentioned that there were some figures from PricewaterhouseCoopers which had predicted an audit for the potential transition, but that at that stage they were not conclusive. I should be grateful if the Minister could give an estimate of the total number of redundancies involved in the transition if he has any further information in that regard.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000242"></a>There are many questions in this large group of amendments to which I hope the Minister will be able to give a full response. I understand that in some cases he will need written help to do so. However, I look forward to his words and to redrafting amendments in the light of his response for the Report stage. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000243"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07010983000480"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I start by considering the modesty of the Government&#146;s ambitions regarding the aim of &#147;good&#148; rather than &#147;best&#148; practice. We could all debate whether the best is the enemy of the good and so on, but if the Government are trying to introduce a new scheme they should seek to be as ambitious as possible. Given that, using the words &#147;good practice&#148; when most people will be looking for &#147;best practice&#148; is either a bit of sloppy draftsmanship or it requires an explanation. I should have thought that in Committee in the other place an amendment could be introduced to clear up the issue. It is not very ambitious to say, &#147;We&#146;ll try to do as well as we can. It might not be brilliant but at least it will be just about &#145;good&#146;&#148;. To be frank, the ambition should be to aim for the best. In certain areas, this Bill demonstrates a degree of slapdash sloppiness, a lack of appreciation for the political pitfalls the Government could face when the Bill is considered in Committee down the Corridor. I would say only to my noble friend in as friendly a way as I can that things like this should be flashed up so that we do not have to trouble with them.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000244"></a>On the other matter, I do not think the issue raised by the noble Baroness about potential staff cuts is necessarily the point here. What we are trying to do in this legislation is to impose on the companies responsible for our utilities higher standards of service than they have previously provided. In the past, inadequate policing of consumer protection schemes by the regulator of these companies has meant that people have been denied access to the service. We all know that billing and failure to pay issues are very severe and worrying.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000245"></a>It is only about three years ago that there were very bad storms in East Anglia. The response of the energy companies to the power cuts there was, frankly, shocking.  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It emerged that one of the reasons for that&#151;apart from the fact that maintenance had not been sharp or effective enough&#151;was that the switchboard was swamped with complaints from consumers who knew nothing about what was happening. They had listened to the local radio station and then phoned the company; if they were lucky enough to get through, the company told them to listen to the local radio station.</p>
<h5><a name="07010983000436"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000246"></a>However, it became clear that across the country this was not a uniform picture. For example, Scottish and Southern and Scottish Power, two of the five big power companies operating across the UK, had call centres located across Britain. When they were confronted with large-scale cut-offs&#151;as they were rather more often than the East Anglian utility&#151;they simply combined the services of all their call centres and took up every complaint. They had staff on call because the winters in Scotland tend to be a wee bit worse than in East Anglia and people were ready and prepared to do this.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000247"></a>It was an exceptional circumstance but, when my colleagues and I on the old Trade and Industry Select Committee in the 2001-05 Parliament looked at this matter, it was glaringly obvious that a number of companies had no fall-back arrangements. While the boxes for the speed of response to complaints were ticked most of the time&#151;93 per cent reacted within two minutes or whatever; I cannot remember the figures&#151;the point I am making is clear enough: we need to ensure from the outset that the new National Consumer Council will be able to insist that the regulator with responsibility for particular areas of consumer service learns the lessons of recent experience.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000248"></a>It is not the everyday problem that worries most people but the extraordinary problem. In some instances, of course, it is not that extraordinary because there are often severe winters, dramatic increases in snowfalls and winds that blow trees over power lines. That is somewhat inconvenient, as it was in East Anglia.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000249"></a>It is our duty to highlight these matters at this stage in the legislative process. Some of it should be done by the regulator insisting that the companies deal with it. Part of the essence of the new approach to consumer protection and consumer advocacy is that far more responsibility will be assumed by the companies than hitherto has been the case. If we achieve that, it will be a burden on the companies. They will not like it; they will complain that it is unreasonable and excessive regulation. But if people are in very cold houses in difficult winter circumstances, if they are subject to flooding or whatever, they are entitled to the best possible service and entitled to expect that the companies would anticipate the worst possible scenario.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000250"></a>One of the effects of climate change is not only that it is warm when we do not expect it to be but that, as we found over the Christmas and New Year period, changes in weather are now much more extreme. Sometimes you have winds in excess of 70 to 80 miles an hour, as happened in Edinburgh on two Hogmanays in a row, which meant that the celebrations had to be cancelled. So we are not just talking about the important  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue of people being cut off because they cannot pay or because their bills have been badly handled by companies&#151;as a constituency Member, I well remember the difficulties that we had getting through to the accounts department and getting it to accept that there was an issue.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000251"></a>Equally, we need to have spelt out in greater detail than the Minister gave on Second Reading the Government&#146;s intention to ensure that we will have in place schemes that will give the companies and the regulator no place to hide when people have immediate problems. When the cut-off is done, when the family is left without gas or electricity and they are freezing cold, assurances that something will be done quickly need to be chiselled into granite, they cannot be simple paper promises from either Ministers or the regulators because we know that, in the past, the regulators have been sloppy. We know also that although the companies have improved in a number of respects they are still not properly geared up to deal with extremities of weather. We hear a lot about climate change, but we do not get a proper appreciation of the nature of the changes in weather that we are experiencing and the impact that that has on supplies of gas and electricity.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000252"></a>Therefore, I would like to think that the Minister will be even more robust. In his wind-up speech on Second Reading, I got the impression that he was getting the message, but it is not enough for just him to get the message; the message must get out to the appropriate players who will be affected by the legislation. The past performance of a number of energy companies in recent years has left a lot to be desired. Not only should we have carrots, we should have sticks. I want substantial punishments for those companies that do not deliver the goods when we have problems of that nature&#151;whether for the individual family or the communities, which are often isolated communities, if they do not have their electricity or gas reconnected within a reasonable time.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000253"></a>As I said, there are examples&#151;although I am a Scot, I am not defending or praising those companies because they are Scottish&#151;of parts of the country which will feel the brunt of the new climatic conditions in which we live. It is essential that we take proper steps at this stage to make it clear to the companies and the regulator that we need a higher level of performance and awareness. Simply to talk about &#147;good&#148; is not good enough; it must be the best.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000254"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010983000481"></a>Lord Newton of Braintree:</b> If anyone is wondering why I have been sitting quietly here at the back it is because I thought this group of amendments gave me the opportunity to come in from what I might call a slightly wider angle. I could link it to my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 114 in which, on my line of thinking, she has left out the wrong paragraph&#151;paragraph (b) rather than paragraph (a)&#151;but I do not mean to elaborate on that or cause dissension in the ranks on this side of the House.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000255"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, will recognise the main point that I am seeking to make and that it will become clear. However, before I say anything else,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I ought to declare something rather curious&#151;I think it could be called a potential prospective interest&#151;in that I am chairman of the Council on Tribunals. Shortly before Christmas, a Bill was debated in this very Room that would turn the Council on Tribunals into an Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, which would give it an interest of a much wider kind, including an interest in ombudsmen. But that is not the situation at the moment: at this stage the council has no locus in that respect, although one of the main parliamentary ombudsmen is an ex-officio member. Having acknowledged that point, I emphasise that I am speaking only for myself.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000256"></a>I find it very strange indeed&#151;I am using an understated word; perhaps I should say &#147;curious&#148;&#151;that we have here a Bill which appears to envisage the possible creation of rival sets of ombudsmen serving consumers. The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, spoke of the Government seeking to create a new scheme. But that is not what the Bill states: the Bill envisages the possibility of multiple schemes. I shall come back to that.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000257"></a>I was surprised that this did not attract more attention on Second Reading, in which debate, unfortunately, I was unable to take part. It was adverted to by my noble friend at column 971 when she asked whether it was likely that there would be more than one scheme, and then perhaps most crisply and notably by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000408"></a>&#147;Having a number of schemes competing, no doubt, to provide the best service for customers, would seem a rather odd system of adjudication in this country. I do not think that it occurs in ombudsman schemes in insurance, banking and so on&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/12/06; col. 974.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000258"></a>Then the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, built on that point and suggested that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010983000424"></a>&#147;it would be better for the existing ombudsman scheme to be the one approved by the DTI and with which everybody will comply&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/12/06; col. 1006.]</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000394"></a>In response to all of that the Minister confirmed:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000409"></a>&#147;The fact is that under the Bill we are leaving it to industry to come forward and seek approval of suitable redress schemes, in the plural, so the situation could be that several schemes are approved&#148; .&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/12/06; col. 1012.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000259"></a>As an individual, I find that very curious. The Bill, in creating the new National Consumer Council, is designed to create greater coherence and reduce confusion for consumers, but it includes this proposal. If I found a way to bring forward a proposal for a rival parliamentary, health service or local government ombudsman, I would be laughed out of court. In the financial services field, which was littered with ombudsmen, the Government went to considerable trouble to create one coherent, statutory financial services ombudsman scheme. I do not know of any proposal in a Bill being discussed on the Floor of the House or anywhere else to have rival legal services ombudsmen, so why do we have these proposals? That is my fundamental question.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0005.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000260"></a>My curiosity is aggravated because I could just about understand the proposal if it was about choice for complainants and consumers, but it is not; it is about choice for firms as to which scheme they join. There is an obvious risk that what is in the best interests of the business rather than the consumer will be at least a factor in some decisions. I am not alone  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in that view. I cannot speak for the British and Irish Ombudsman Association, although I know it quite well, but I feel that I should place on record what it said in response to the relevant question in the consultation just under one year ago. Referring to the possibility of multiple schemes, it stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000410"></a>&#147;We feel this&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000395"></a>that is, multiple schemes&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07010983000425"></a>&#147;causes confusion and different standards, processes etc. BIOA supports a fully joined-up and straightforward approach to Ombudsman services for the consumer. It sees any attempt to streamline and simplify the process of dealing with complaints and receiving redress as being highly desirable and in the public interest. This would include having at the most, one scheme per industry/sector&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="07010983000437"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000261"></a>I note&#151;and I should recognise this before inviting the Minister to comment&#151;that Clause 48(2) requires a regulator to have regard to the number of other redress schemes already in place in making decisions about the interests of consumers. That implies a recognition that a plethora of schemes is not desirable. But where is the balance between one scheme and a plethora of schemes? Although the subsection does not use the word &#147;plethora&#148;, how will that judgment sensibly be made? I remain extremely puzzled and I would appreciate any comment from the Minister on the reasoning in this regard.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000262"></a>Perhaps I may ask him a specific question. I have already referred to financial services and legal services: has any other department in Whitehall gone down this path of creating the possibility of competing ombudsman schemes being chosen by the firm, not by the customer&#151;or, indeed, of competing ombudsman schemes at all? We need a clearer understanding of the thinking behind that and the justification for it before we can conclude consideration of this part of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made a good point at Second Reading and I hope that he thought it was a good point to make today. I am very grateful to him.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000263"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010983000482"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I have considerable sympathy with the points that have just been made and I would like to hear the Government&#146;s justification for their approach. However, I want to concentrate on the first of the amendments in the group, which is important. I support the amendment&#151;or, at least, I would support a form of wording that achieved the same objective. I am grateful that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, has raised the whole question of how we deal with complaints under this new structure.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000264"></a>Part of the Government&#146;s strategy, as I understand it, as my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill said, is to ensure that companies meet better standards of complaints handling than is currently the case. That requires the regulators to be heavy and requires the Government to be heavy with the regulators. Although I do not support every amendment to delete &#147;may&#148; and insert &#147;must&#148; or &#147;shall&#148;, I support this one because unless the regulators concerned, Ofgem and the postal services regulator, accept as central to their tasks upgrading the standards of the companies within their field, this will not work.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000265"></a>Large-scale general complaints and general issues that have been raised with Energywatch and Postwatch will not be able to be dealt with by Consumer Direct. That has been recognised in relation to emergency provision within the new NCC. But between those two types of complaint, the emergency complaint and a specific complaint that can be easily dealt with, Energywatch and Postwatch deal with a whole range of complaints. In most other industries, such complaints would be seen as the responsibility of the company. Part of the failure of regulation in the post-privatisation industries is that that has not been seen as a priority by the regulators. It is, therefore, important, that regulators do not have an option to specify higher standards of customer service, which they will regulate and for which there will be sanctions for failure, but have an obligation to do so.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000266"></a>I recognise that there is an issue of propriety, that the regulators are independent and, therefore, that a &#147;must&#148; or a &#147;shall&#148; would raise certain issues, but this matter is so central to the achievement of the strategy that the Government are embarked on&#151;and so central to what ought to have been the responsibility of the regulator in any case&#151;that it is important that there is no discretion but for the regulators to set standards. That seems to be the objective of the first of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments. The regulators may have some discretion in relation to the subsequent clauses&#151;I do not necessarily support her second amendment in the group&#151;but being forced to set those regulations must be a central pillar of the way that we do this.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000267"></a>There is another point: even if the regulators set stringent standards, are prepared to enforce them and are required to do so, it would take some time before the companies adjusted their process, practice and culture to achieve those standards. In the interim, there is an issue as to how those kinds of complaints and queries are dealt with. Ultimately, they should be dealt with internally within the companies, and the stronger the regulator is in forcing the companies to do that, the better. But there is also a transitional issue as to how those complaints are dealt with in the interim. Having Government clarification of this on the record would be helpful. Perhaps they could indicate at a later stage how the regulators will be obliged to do what the amendment is intended to make them do.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000268"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010983000483"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> Perhaps I may comment on the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, to whom I am most grateful for picking up on my brief comments at Second Reading which expressed surprise and queried the provision for redress schemes in the plural. I wondered whether some new type of competitive adjudication schemes would be introduced in this country for certain fields of interest. I agree with pretty well every word that the noble Lord has uttered.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000269"></a>I would add only that it is not just this part of the Bill that talks about redress schemes in the plural; the whole of Schedule 6 is devoted to them in relation to estate agents and, therefore, envisages something remarkable. So far, we have not heard sufficient explanation from Her Majesty&#146;s Government as to why that is the case and whether any precedents are being relied upon.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07010983000270"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010983000484"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> This seems to be a good moment for me to come in. I shall deal with Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 to Clause 42, but before that I shall answer a couple of questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked about how the redress schemes apply to relevant consumers. In the energy sector they apply to private consumers and businesses, but not suppliers. Both the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill mentioned the protection of vulnerable consumers. I repeat that the Bill provides under Clause 11 for the council to have specific powers to investigate complaints made by vulnerable consumers in the designated sectors and under Clause 12 to act on behalf of consumers who become vulnerable through disconnection of their gas or electricity supplies. So there is provision for immediate support for vulnerable consumers who find themselves in difficulty, particularly in relation to disconnections.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000271"></a>Returning to Amendments Nos. 111 and 112, subsection (2) states that the regulator may make regulations in respect of all complaints or those of a specified kind. Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 replace each &#147;may&#148; with &#147;must&#148;. It is normal for legislation to use the word &#147;may&#148; when conferring a power, because the legislation does not and cannot say when the power should be exercised or how it should be exercised. The timing and content of regulations is not prescribed in the Bill. These provisions will need to adaptable, to be applied on a sector-by-sector basis, with each regulator being able to take a different approach to suit the sector&#146;s own particular requirements. It will be for the regulator to determine the need to make regulations, or when and how to amend them in the future. If there is to be a duty, then the legislation must lay down clearly what the person is duty-bound to do. If there is to be discretion as to when and how the regulator is to act, then &#147;may&#148; is legally the right word.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000272"></a>I hope that that adds some clarity, but I appreciate the points made by my noble friend Lord Whitty and I will consider them further. However, I would point out that we have consulted with the regulators concerned and they are broadly content with the approach we have adopted. As drafted, the power allows a regulator to take a view about whether and when such regulations are necessary.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000273"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 114, which seeks to alter Clause 46 covering the requirements relating to redress schemes. This clause introduces a statutory requirement for service providers in the energy and postal services sectors to belong to a redress scheme, and will in effect give consumers in those sectors greater assurance of achieving certainty of resolution of their complaints. It allows the Secretary of State to make orders requiring regulated suppliers in those sectors to belong to a redress scheme. It specifies that such a scheme must be approved by the relevant regulator or be administered by the Secretary of State or a person appointed for the purpose, and designated as an appropriate redress scheme. Before an order can be made under this clause, the Secretary of State is required to consult the relevant regulator and others who represent those with an interest in the matter. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that there is  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at least one redress scheme that regulated suppliers who are required by order to belong to a scheme are able to join before making such an order.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000274"></a>Moving on to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, about having several schemes up and running and questions asked by other noble Lords and my noble friend Lord Borrie about whether there are any precedents, the answer is yes, for example in the telecoms sector. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry are responsible for the telecommunications and broadcasting regulatory regime where two telecoms redress schemes are operating. It is our view that regulators are best placed to decide on the appropriate number of schemes to be approved to operate within each of the sectors. In approving a redress scheme, the provisions place a requirement on the regulator to have regard to the total number of qualifying schemes available to the relevant suppliers. But that does not mean that there has to be a plethora of schemes; there can be just one. That is the current position.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000275"></a>In the event that no scheme is set up by industry, the clause contains provisions for the Secretary of State to establish one. This is an additional guarantee that in the unlikely event that industry is not able to put a scheme in place, the Secretary of State has the power to establish a suitable one so that he will be able to make an order requiring suppliers to belong to a scheme. Amendment No. 114 would remove those contingency arrangements. I hope that noble Lords will accept that this provision is needed as a fallback to give an assurance that a qualifying scheme will be available for suppliers to belong to, and so that the Secretary of State can bring these requirements into force. The essence of these reforms stems from our firm belief that empowering and protecting consumers is fundamental to the achievement of a successful, fair and competitive market. We want to give consumers a simple and effective system of redress that is easily accessible and offers the best all-round protection.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000276"></a>A basic requirement for such a system must involve the consumer interest being taken into account. These provisions have been drafted to provide explicit assurances on several levels. The introduction of redress schemes means that consumers will benefit from the certainty of a resolution of a complaint and the provision of redress where appropriate. In approving the redress schemes, the relevant regulator will be required to have regard to established good practice such as, for example, the guidance published by the British and Irish Ombudsman Association. Regulatory oversight will help to avoid the undue proliferation of schemes and ensure monitoring of standards of performance for consumers seeking redress. On balance, we feel that a regulator is best placed to ensure that sector-specific issues in the interests of relevant current consumers, or indeed those who may become consumers in the future, are captured and considered as part of the approval process, including the number of other redress schemes that are available to regulated suppliers which qualify as suitable redress schemes. The consumer&#146;s interest is key to this package of provisions and must be seen to be taken into account.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000277"></a>Amendment No. 117 relates to Clause 48. The clause outlines the matters a regulator must take into account prior to approving the key features of any qualifying redress scheme. The clause places a requirement on regulators to consider the provisions of the scheme and the manner in which it must be operated, the interest of relevant consumers, including the total number of qualifying schemes, and the recommendations of any generally accepted principles of good practice that may be applicable to the operation of a redress scheme. The amendment seeks to replace the word &#147;good&#148; with &#147;best&#148; in this instance.</p>
<h5><a name="07010983000438"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000278"></a>I believe that we agree on the fundamental issue of the need to ensure that any approved redress scheme conforms to generally accepted criteria for recognition in the provision of redress. An example of such criteria would be the guidelines provided by the British and Irish Ombudsman Association, which covers issues such as independence, fairness, effectiveness and public accountability. We fully understand the sentiment behind replacing &#147;good&#148; with &#147;best&#148;. On the one hand, we want consumers to receive the best treatment under these redress schemes; on the other hand, we do not want to place too onerous a burden on a regulator in trying to evaluate and compare all the good practices in order to determine which is the &#147;best&#148; practice. I therefore want to consider the amendment further to see if we can accept it.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000279"></a>We are giving regulators the power to make regulations to prescribe complaint-handling standards that would be binding on suppliers. Information about suppliers&#146; levels of compliance with any prescribed standards would be placed in the public domain. That is a fundamental aspect of the new model for consumer redress being introduced by these measures. The amendment would place an additional burden on regulators and scheme administrators in determining whether suppliers operated appropriate and effective schemes. We believe it is possible to achieve the desired outcomes through the imposition and monitoring of performance in meeting complaint-handling standards.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000280"></a>Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 concern the terminology used to describe the Consumer Direct service, which is supported by the OFT. The paragraph concerned refers to the necessary flows of information to be established between the Consumer Direct service and the redress schemes. Consumer Direct is a public consumer advice scheme supported by the OFT. We cannot refer to it by name in the Bill, as the service has no legal personality. The word &#147;public&#148; describes those to whom Consumer Direct offers consumer advice&#151;the public. Advice is provided to an individual member of the public in a one-to-one conversation with an adviser. As I have said, Consumer Direct is simply the name under which the service is provided. The draftsman has given us a good set of words, and we hope that noble Lords will understand why the Government feel it appropriate to form the clause in this way.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000281"></a>On Amendment No. 122, we envisage that a regulator should have the option to withdraw approval from a scheme either generally or simply in relation to specified consumer complaints. The amendment would risk  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disadvantaging consumers in respect of whom a scheme was operating satisfactorily by requiring the regulator to take an all-or-nothing approach to removing approval.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000282"></a>Clause 49 sets out provisions on how the application and approval of redress schemes is to be conducted, and it is important that it stands part of the Bill. It enables the regulator to determine the manner in which an application for approval is made, and places a requirement on the scheme administrator of an approved redress scheme to provide notice of any changes to the scheme within a specified period. It also allows a regulator to refuse or withdraw approval for a scheme in accordance with the procedure in Clause 50. I apologise that it has taken so long to go through all these amendments, but the group was quite large.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000283"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010983000485"></a>Lord Newton of Braintree:</b> Before my noble friend gives a final proper response&#151;at least, I assume it will be&#151;may I say briefly that I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments and will reflect on them, although I continue to feel that there are some problems here? He is right that there is more than one ombudsman in the telecommunications sector, but I believe that he acknowledged that the DTI had also had a hand in that proposal, albeit with the DCMS alongside it. I should put on the record that I was aware of that, as are others. It would be putting it mildly to say that there are mixed views on the merits of that for consumers. I shall not add to that at this stage.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000284"></a>The other point that I want to put firmly on record is that there is the most glaring disparity between what is envisaged here and what the Government have done in relation to financial services. I therefore hope that the Minister will reflect on what I have said, and on what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said, too.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000285"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07010983000486"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> This is a large group of amendments. Amendments are put into large groups, which sometimes makes it difficult for the Minister to respond on his feet. I am fully aware of that. We try very hard, when looking at the groupings that the Government have given us, to see if there is any logical way that we can get through them in a way that the Minister can give a reply that he feels comfortable with. I thank the Minister very much for the amount of work that he has personally done in trying to respond to these amendments.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000286"></a>I must say that it has been a delight to have the support of the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, for the first time in all these debates, on &#147;good&#148; and &#147;best practice&#148;. It was rather brave of him to refer to sloppiness and slap-dash drafting. I am not sure that I would ever have the courage to accuse Her Majesty&#146;s civil servants of slap-dash and sloppy drafting. I shall not line up with that one, but I am delighted to have the noble Lord&#146;s support on &#147;good&#148; and &#147;best&#148;. I think that &#147;best&#148; is best and I know that the Minister will go away and have a look at that point.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000287"></a>I then had my wrist slapped by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree&#151;my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree&#151;who picked up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who was Director-General of Fair Trading when I was

To hear him being quoted made me sit up and start making a few notes. I will read very carefully what the Minister said in reply. I received a bit of a jolt at one stage, because I thought that he said something about the way that the legislation has been drafted, or the way that it will move forward, meant that it is possible for there to be only one ombudsman. I must have got that incorrect, or maybe I was dreaming, so I will read carefully what the Minister actually said.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000288"></a>I am delighted to have the support of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, who is, of course, the present chairman of the National Consumer Council and will be taking it forward through this enormous change. He is right to be concerned over a body that was never intended to handle complaints, whose duty was over many years, and during the years that I chaired it, to do the blue-skies thinking that no other consumer body worldwide was ever able to do. It was funded by the Government to take its time and to write good reports that we could build on. It was 11 years ago that I produced the piece of work that raised concern about the selling of sugar and fat to children through television advertising. It is only now that we see that work coming to fruition. Sometimes the best work takes a long time to get there.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister that he was able at this late stage to take so much time and trouble to try to give us all the answers that we would want.

<p><a name="07010983000308"></a>The noble Earl said: We have moved on to Part 3, which deals with estate agents. At this stage I must declare my interest as a surveyor and a consultant to an estate agency firm, something which most noble Lords have known for some time.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0006.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000309"></a>We are behaving rather strangely in that we are one of the few countries in the world to have no restrictions to becoming an estate agent. Pretty well anyone can set up an estate agency without qualifications, training, supervision or regulation, and yet that person could well be handling what is for the great majority of people the most important transaction they are ever likely to deal with: the buying and selling of their property. That is in marked contrast not only to what other countries are doing, but also to every other professional sector in the United Kingdom. How can the Minister possibly justify this position? When one compares the situation with regard to estate agents with that of financial advisers, legal advisers, conveyancers or surveyors, there is a marked difference. All of the other professional bodies are subject to considerable regulation by which they have to abide.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70109-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000310"></a>As I said, I am a consultant to an estate agent&#146;s company and a surveyor. It took six years to become fully qualified as a surveyor with the appropriate initials. That is a lengthy training and there are very strict regulations associated with the profession. However, I needed none of that training to set up as an estate agent. To me, that is quite wrong. Noble Lords will recall that at Second Reading I also raised the question of someone in the City&#151;I cited the example of my daughter&#151;having to take a vast array of examinations to meet the regulations laid down by the Financial Services Authority in order to sell a few shares. In marked contrast, when dealing with something that is usually far more important to people&#151;their property&#151;a person may have absolutely no qualifications or training at all. This Bill provides us with a golden opportunity to set a standard of competence for estate agents that would lift them from being, along with politicians, the most disliked and disrespected group of workers up to something rather better, on a par with their financial counterparts.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000311"></a>We are lucky in that we have the Estate Agents Act 1979 because in Section 22 provision is made for the regulations. All the Minister has to do is enact those regulations, and that is the purport of my amendment. I understand that the Minister&#146;s position is not an easy one. He has come into a department and is doing a good job, having been presented with a Bill into which he had no input. But, as we have been discussing it, it is clear that this is quite a peely-wally Bill&#151;as we say north of the Border. We have all been nice about the legislation, but will it really help the consumer? In parts, yes, but as the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan, made clear a few moments ago on Amendment No. 111, he is appalled by the modesty of the Government&#146;s ambitions. Here is a chance for the Government to redeem themselves and try to help the consumer.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000312"></a>The Minister stated clearly the Government&#146;s position at Second Reading. He is against the regulation and licensing of estate agents, but is happy to have a redress scheme. However, I put it to him that that is far

The event has happened and all we are doing is trying to clear up the mess afterwards. I am trying to prevent the mess happening in the first place. I am not alone in thinking that regulation and licensing are certainly one way forward. Indeed, I know of no respectable estate agent anywhere in the country who does not want this. We are all fed up of cowboys, but the Government are supporting them because they are the ones who can drive the cowboys off the street with this legislation but are making no attempt to do so.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000313"></a>The Minister is also at odds with his Chief Whip and his Deputy Chief Whip. In 1977, Bryan Davies MP, now the noble Lord, Lord Davies, backed by Mr Bruce Grocott MP, now the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, put forward the Estate Agents Bill. If he happened to look at Clause 20 of that Bill, which the Government took up and which became the Estate Agents Act 1979, he would find their desire for regulation. The section states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000414"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument make provision for ensuring that persons engaged in estate agency work satisfy minimum standards of competence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000396"></a>And so it goes on. The Minister has a problem on his own side.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000314"></a>The Government are also at odds with themselves, because unfortunately, and most unusually for government civil servants, they do not seem to be talking to each other. Just as we are discussing a Bill that prevents estate agents being regulated, in the main Chamber they are discussing the Legal Services Bill, which provides exactly for the regulation of estate agents. The Minister might know about that Bill. I refer him to Part 5, which provides for alternative business structures to be set up that can include estate agents. Those estate agents will be regulated, because regulation is needed under that structure.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000315"></a>Big estate agents increasingly want to amalgamate with lawyers. We discussed that quite a lot in debates on the home information packs. The Government wanted to make one-stop shops at which you could get your surveyor, your estate agent, your mortgage and your legal advice all in the same building. Those people will have to be regulated. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the Explanatory Note to Clause 175 of the Legal Services Bill, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000415"></a>&#147;Prospective ABS firms&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000397"></a>that is, alternative business structure firms&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07010983000426"></a>&#147;(referred to in the Bill as &#147;licensed bodies&#148;) will have to be licensed by a &#147;licensing authority&#148; (either an approved regulator that has successfully applied to become a licensing authority, or the Board itself)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000398"></a>where no appropriate licensing authority is in place. The Government set out in the Explanatory Notes to that Bill all the advantages that this will give people. One advantage that they rate so highly is increased consumer confidence. Is that not what we are talking about in relation to the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill? Is not increased consumer confidence and protection exactly why we are discussing the Bill at some length? The Government say that increased consumer confidence is a great thing with one Bill that is being discussed in the Chamber, but that it is not what they want at all with this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000316"></a>My noble friend Lord Newton and the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made a point about the multiple redress schemes when speaking to Amendment No. 111. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was the one who pointed out that those schemes also apply to estate agents. So where will the consumer be in the future? At the moment, he has a very low opinion of any estate agent. Politicians, estate agents and second-hand car salesmen are at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000317"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010983000488"></a>Noble Lords:</b> Journalists!</p>

My experience of them certainly does not warrant them being on it. What will the consumer be faced with in the future? He will hope that the Bill will do something about estate agents, but all he will find is that there will be a redress scheme for some estate agents. However, other estate agents will be regulated and licensed. So, what does the consumer do when making his choice? How will he find out the information that we have a multi-tier system for estate agents, some of whom have to meet certain standards and some of whom do not?</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000319"></a>There will be a third tier of estate agents who will still be the cowboys that we all want to get rid of and who will avoid this provision until the last possible moment. They do not need to tell anyone that they are setting up as an estate agent. It is only when a complaint has been made and the proposed redress scheme comes into effect that the consumer will know about that person. The person can simply fold the business up and go off and do another job. I do not believe that that is helping the consumer. It puts him in a far worse position than he is in now. I really hope that the Minister will look at this issue very seriously between now and another stage. It is vital. The biggest transaction of most people&#146;s lives will be to buy and sell. They need to have utter confidence that the team acting for them is of the best quality and the highest standards. At the moment, it cannot be argued that that is the case, and it certainly cannot be the case in the future because the Bill does not help them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000320"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010983000490"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has spoken to his amendment reasonably, modestly and with humour, but I do not agree with it. I express a great deal of doubt about it. As I understand it, the view of the then Labour Government in 1979 at the time of the Estate Agents Act and, indeed, of the following Conservative Government, was in essence that no regulations under Section 22 of the Act should be made until a need for standards of competence was demonstrated for the estate-agency world.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000321"></a>There was concern then, and there should still be concern today, that competition in the field of acting as an agent for the selling of residential property would be unnecessarily inhibited if standards and qualifications were specified, and there would invariably be a tendency, promoted by existing estate agents, especially those like the noble Earl with professional qualifications, to push for more exacting standards than are necessary or desirable in the relatively simple act of acting as an agent for the sale of residential property.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000322"></a>It is not at all obvious, and the noble Earl has not indicated, what the minimum standards are that are necessary or desirable for an estate agent to have when handling a typical private house purchase. It seems clear, but the noble Earl did not indicate whether it is clear to him, that it would be well over the top to require the standards of a qualified surveyor or valuer with the six years&#146; training which the noble Earl went through. If it is not to be the high standards of a qualified surveyor, it is hardly worth laying down a few basic requirements of competence. Proposals for training, examinations and long periods of apprenticeship are often promoted by existing practitioners in particular occupations for new people coming into that field. We should appreciate that the interests of existing practitioners and the interests of the public do not necessarily coincide.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000323"></a>I recall an example given by the great economist Milton Friedman&#151;he was usually regarded as a Conservative economist&#151;of a proposal that all newly established barbers in a particular state in the United States should be required to undergo 1,000 hours of training in the theory of hair before they were allowed to wield any scissors on customers. This proposal came not from consumers concerned about the competence of barbers but from existing barbers who would have been only too delighted if competition were restricted.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000324"></a>I do not think the noble Earl admitted or recognised the fact that most complaints about estate agents, nowadays and in the past, are not about incompetence but about malpractice and a lack of integrity in advancing their own interests instead of those of the clients for whom they are supposed to act and keep in the forefront of their minds. Such matters should be dealt with by the negative licensing powers of the Office of Fair Trading to strike off estate agents from acting in that world, and by the ombudsman schemes that exist in practice at the moment or that might exist in statutory form under the Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000325"></a>I doubt the desirability of the amendment. I would be interested to hear from the noble Earl and the Minister what these minimum standards would be and how we can ensure that they are not raised regularly from time to time to suit not the interests of the public but those of estate agents.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000326"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010983000491"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> I thank my noble friend Lord Caithness for his amendment and for the contribution to the debate of his great experience in the industry. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, he spoke briefly, he spoke well, and he spoke with humour. There is an awful lot of passion behind what he has said today and his arguments have great value. However, we are not yet convinced that a decision to license the industry can be made easily after one debate. I await the Minister&#146;s response with great interest and look forward to debating the matter further, as I expect we shall on Report.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000327"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010983000492"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue and I thank the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, for his passionate, knowledgeable and thoughtful

He has, of course, a great deal of experience in this field, which I am sure noble Lords appreciated even more when he moved his amendment. However, let me try to explain the Government&#146;s position on this important subject.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000328"></a>The noble Earl referred to the Legal Services Bill. Of course, I am not dealing with that Bill, but my understanding is that it will not regulate estate agents as estate agents but as a part of alternative business structures, including lawyers. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that he made an interesting point. I will look into the matter further and write to him about it.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000329"></a>Although Section 22 of the 1979 Act enables the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to require estate agents to meet minimum standards of competence before they can engage in estate agency, the section has never been implemented. It would be made more complicated by accepting the amendment. </p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000330"></a>The OFT report published in 2004 followed a thorough two-year study of the market. The OFT considered whether positive licensing was necessary and concluded that it would not deal with the main identified causes of serious problems in this market. The Government share this view. The agent&#146;s role as an intermediary and salesman would not normally require qualifications by law.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000331"></a>There is little documented evidence that agents who have been banned would have been unable to obtain those qualifications if required to do so. The OFT found that in most cases where estate agents committed acts of serious misconduct that led to them being banned, the misconduct appeared to result from a lack of integrity by individuals rather than a lack of qualifications or knowledge of the law. Nor are qualifications a bar to dishonest practices in any profession; we can all think of many examples of professional misconduct in a number of professions.</p>
<h5><a name="07010983000440"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000332"></a>One or two interesting studies have been done. The OFT did a market study and found that in other jurisdictions where qualifications or licences were required for an estate agent to work, consumers experienced similar problems to those experienced in the UK. The OFT study found that most problems occurred through a lack of integrity rather than through any lack of knowledge or qualifications. Most estate agents who have been banned in recent years had no previous history of criminality, so would have been unlikely to have been screened out through any process that could have been introduced, whether through training or a series of qualifications. An example that has been given is the issue of a driving licence to someone. There is no guarantee that that person will not commit an offence or speed.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000333"></a>I agree with a lot of what my noble friend Lord Borrie said. He gave us a brilliant exposition of minimum standards of competence. I agree that minimum standards of competence could restrict competition. That is at least arguable. You would therefore be creating a more or less exclusive club. That may raise prices in the market and restrict those in the profession, thereby almost creating a rather expensive closed shop, which is not to the benefit of consumers. So it is arguable,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and at least debatable, that if you introduced minimum standards of competence, you would reduce competition and therefore adversely affect the benefits that consumers receive from downward pressure on prices, which reflects the ease with which estate agents can currently set up and enter the market.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000334"></a>Of course, most good estate agents offer proper training schemes for their employees, so there are already estate agents who operate to proper professional standards. The issue is how you deal with the bad apples and the best way of dealing with them. It is debatable whether that should be through qualifications or, as we are suggesting, through a redress scheme that deals with the problems that arise.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000335"></a>Based on considered evidence, the benefits to consumers from introducing compulsory qualifications are, in the Government&#146;s view, unproven. There would, however, be costs. The industry bodies are keen to control standards themselves. This might be a cheap option for government but, as I have indicated, it will be the consumers who ultimately pay the price of allowing those bodies to control access to their industry. Some consumer groups advocate setting up a new independent regulator, which would be even more costly.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000336"></a>I recognise the strength of feeling in the Grand Committee about this issue, but it is the job of government to weigh up the costs and benefits of all the options objectively using the evidence available. I have given some examples of that. As the regulatory impact assessment shows, any benefit from introducing mandatory qualifications for estate agents cannot currently be justified by the costs.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000337"></a>The Bill will improve the current negative licensing system and require agents to join approved redress schemes. We believe that this is a more effective way of dealing with the significant problems in the industry without unnecessarily driving up costs to consumers.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000338"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0007.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07010983000493"></a>The Earl of Caithness:</b> I fully expected the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. He and I have discussed this matter at various times and in various places around the House and in the Chamber. Indeed, he took a different view from me on the matter of the home information pack. It looks as though my view and not that of the noble Lord is winning at the moment, but we shall wait and see what happens in time. Things might change, and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, will agree with me that the surveyor&#146;s element of the home information pack was perhaps not the brightest of the Government&#146;s ideas in the past couple of years. The noble Lord said this was a wonderful thing and would be undertaken by highly qualified people to increase standards and make them more exacting. That is absolutely not what I am after; I am not saying that everyone should be a surveyor to be an agent. I believe that every estate agent should be a member of an approved body, which is totally different. That is a low level of regulation that will not add to the cost, to which both the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and the Minister referred.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000339"></a>What I found interesting about the speeches of both noble Lords is that if that is their attitude and belief, why have we got regulation for the financial market, for lawyers, for surveyors, and for everyone  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>else? What is the point of it? You cannot say, &#147;This is applicable to those sets of professionals, but we are not going to touch these dreadful estate agents. There is no justification for it. It will ramp up costs and will be a closed shop&#148;. What do you think the lawyers are if not a closed shop? They are far worse than estate agents.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000340"></a>I am not saying that we want to bring the level up to a full surveyor standard. Indeed, I had to retrain to become a house surveyor under the home information pack scheme. To me, that is as important a job, or would have been had the Government not decided not to implement it&#151;I hope there are not too many &#147;nots&#148; in the middle of that sentence&#151;as that of the person who handles the transaction for and on behalf of the client as an estate agent. That is the person who needs to belong to some organisation, because it is the peer-group pressure within that organisation that will help to raise standards and give the consumer confidence.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000341"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, which I shall read with care. He said that integrity, not lack of knowledge, is the cause of complaints. Was it not integrity in the City that caused the problems? Was it not the integrity of the lawyers? One has only to read the history of Brougham Hall&#151;a book has been published about that&#151;to see how the lawyers and the accountants behaved then. They may be members of approved bodies, but that does not stop there being a lack of integrity in such firms. Sadly, you will never stop a lack of integrity&#151;I wish one could&#151;because it is part of human nature.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000342"></a>I really believe it is necessary for agents to be members of an organisation. The National Association of Estate Agents has set up a code that is not as high a standard as the one needed to become a surveyor, but it is a recognised code and a set of standards of which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, would approve. I do not want to go any higher than that. I do not want to ratchet it up or to cause expense, because organisations such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the National Association of Estate Agents already exist and are ready to do the job.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000343"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to spare some time between now and the next stage so that we can get together to see if we can find some common ground. Although I understand his arguments, if they apply to agents, they should apply to the rest of them. We ought to take away all the consumer confidence that we have built up by having this regulation for the other bodies.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000344"></a>I return to the case of my daughter. Why does she have to go through all these financial service exams? Is that not a closed shop? Is that not exactly what the Minister is arguing that we should not have with estate agencies? I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s very full response and for the tepid support of my noble friend Lady Wilcox. I have absolutely no doubt that it will come to the boil by the next stage. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000347"></a>The noble Earl said: The proposals for estate agencies are to be brought in by amending the Estate Agents Act 1979, but that Act came into force in a very different climate from the one today. The Act related entirely to the buying and selling of properties. Since then a huge new market, the lettings market, has developed. The Act fails to legislate on the residential letting market and that of residential property management.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000348"></a>The National Association of Estate Agents, the UK&#146;s leading professional body for estate agency personnel, receives approximately 13,000 queries a year, of which a good majority are to do with residential lettings rather than sales. The vast majority of the complaints made to the association are about lettings. The residential lettings market sees a much higher turnover than residential sales so there is more opportunity for things to go wrong. The Bill ignores this end of the market, which is perhaps in just as great need of regulation as estate agents. My amendment aims to change the definition of an estate agent in the Estate Agents Act to include the residential lettings and management markets.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000349"></a>I know the Minister will say that things have improved and that we are to have tenancy deposit schemes, but we need to look a little deeper than that. The lettings market has become very big business. I believe that something like &#163;130 billion has been involved in the market since 2000, but less than 40 per cent of letting agents belong to any professional body. So, again, the poor consumer has no standards to go by and can have no possible confidence in a letting agent because they have no idea whether the person has qualifications or belongs to an organisation. Again, to pre-empt what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, will say, the RICS, the National Association of Estate Agents and the Association of Residential Letting Agents all want the amendment and support me on it. It is not a closed-shop argument; it is to try to get a basis into the market that provides increased consumer confidence. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000352"></a>Buying a house is for most people the greatest financial transaction they make in their lifetime; it is certainly one of the greatest transactions in an emotional and logistical sense. Just because an individual has purchased a property through a developer, there is no reason why he or she should not enjoy the same protection as if they had gone elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000353"></a>The statutory recognition of redress in estate agency is one of the most important measures the Bill will introduce. Yet, as with so much legislation before your Lordships, this central function has been relegated to secondary legislation. The crux of this matter is that the redress scheme should not only be independent, but be seen to be independent. Surveys in <I>Which?</I> have shown that 72 per cent of people believe that estate agents invent offers, while 74 per cent think that estate agents and property developers work together in a dishonest way for their own benefit. Those figures come from an online survey and are a useful insight into the general perception of the way the industry functions.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000354"></a>I am confident that there is already very good practice within the estate agency market. Unfortunately, though, there is also a good deal of uncertainty over where to go to receive a good service. Without the positive and public approval of a redress scheme, it will be difficult to instil public confidence in the new provisions. What is more, if many of these schemes do not adhere to one set of standards, there will be very little faith in the redress schemes being set up.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000355"></a>That brings me to Amendments Nos. 134, 135 and 136. Amendment No. 135 seeks to ensure that there will be one code of practice behind the redress schemes. Amendment No. 134 seeks to ensure that a code of practice has to be approved by the Office of Fair Trading in accordance with the categories prescribed in sub-paragraphs (2) to (8) of the new Schedule. With regard to those categories, I believe that there may be some scope for improvement. It is essential to achieve transparency within the scheme, ensuring that clear reasons are given for decisions and that there is monitoring of consumer satisfaction&#151;for example, the analysis of complaints&#151;as well as good communication of information on how the scheme works.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000356"></a>I would also be grateful to the Minister if he could shed light on the issue of option contracts. These contain terms not normally found in traditional estate agency contracts. Based on complaints from the OFT, it is clear that consumers are sometimes unaware of the potential implications of such contracts. They allow a property developer to offer the seller a certain guaranteed price for a property, thereby making a  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>profit from the margin they secure when the market fluctuates. In a recent report, the OFT called for consumers to be given the same protection in law for those who employ businesses using option contracts as those who employ traditional estate agents. I should be interested if the Minister could inform noble Lords whether that area will be included as of necessity in the redress schemes.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000357"></a>The new schedule currently allows for the scheme to have voluntary jurisdiction over other areas of the property industry, which could allow complaints about lettings and surveyors to be dealt with under the scheme. I would be grateful if the Minister could inform noble Lords whether he expects schemes to extend to the areas I have outlined and what accountability the OFT will have in enforcing the provisions of the redress scheme. Does the Minister expect there to be a majority of consumer representation on governing bodies of redress schemes?</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000358"></a>Amendment No. 136 simply replaces the duty for the OFT to consider,</p>
<ul><a name="07010983000427"></a>&#147;generally accepted principles of good practice&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000399"></a>in relation to consumer redress schemes with considering best practice when deciding which scheme to adopt. It is a probing amendment, following on from Amendment No. 134, with a view to ensuring high standards in the forthcoming schemes.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000359"></a>I await the Minister&#146;s views on these points with great interest. In the light of the evidence collated by <I>Which?</I>, and with the interests of consumers at stake, I remain convinced that the order to establish a redress scheme should be subject to proper scrutiny and promoted to an order subject to positive resolution. I say again that this is a lot of amendments grouped together. I am quite sure, given the speed at which the people behind him are moving, that he will receive a few notes, but if there are some that he cannot get in time, I hope he will write to me.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000360"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010983000496"></a>Lord Dubs:</b> I declare a couple of interests. The first is that I introduced a Bill on estate agents in the last Session. Had the Government seen themselves able to accept that Bill, we would not be sitting here now. We would have finished with the subject. The other is that I am in the process of trying to sell a house and buy another property. I could tell noble Lords a little more about estate agents than they might perhaps be aware of, but I will not take up the Committee&#146;s time in going into anecdotes about estate agents&#151;except to say that I feel pretty well informed about practices, both good and exemplary and not so good or exemplary.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000361"></a>I appreciate that this is the Minister&#146;s first Bill on assuming office. I wish him good luck with it and thank him for being so approachable on the whole issue of estate agents. I have had two conversations with him and have found him very open to discussion. He did not agree with me, but he is open to talking about the topic. I appreciate his willingness to engage in discussion and to be helpful to Members of this Committee.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000362"></a>I support Amendment No. 123A, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. It is right that the legislation should cover an area of activity by estate agents that  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gives rise to more complaints than sales. It would give people who are quite vulnerable in relation to letting properties or management issues some security and safeguards. I hope the Government will consider adopting an amendment along the same lines.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000363"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie said earlier that some wishes to regulate by members of an industry were a measure to prevent competition. I do not want to get into the argument about the last amendment, but shall simply say this: on the issue covered by Amendment No. 123A, all the bodies in the industry seem to want this type of safeguard. It is a safeguard that should bite on all of them. It is not a matter of saying, &#147;Keep others out&#148;, but of saying, &#147;We are willing to submit ourselves to further provisions to protect the consumer&#148;. My noble friend nods in agreement. I would argue, therefore, that while most industries complain about being over-regulated, here is an industry that is represented by a number of bodies, all of whom want this approach. That is quite interesting and I hope it is persuasive to the Government.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000364"></a>I turn to the two amendments standing in my name. Amendment No. 133 seeks to increase from six to 12 months the period during which an enforcement or penalty charge notice might be applied against an estate agent who has not registered. Six months might be quite a short period in which to get the necessary evidence. Sometimes it might be possible to take enforcement action within weeks. No one is saying it is a minimum period.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000365"></a>I am worried that six months might be too short. To achieve the purposes of this part of the Bill, 12 months would not mean departing from what the Government are setting out to do, but might make it a bit more effective. It would certainly give trading standards a little more time to gather evidence. I can appreciate, particularly in view of my dealings with estate agents in the past little while, that this is a complicated area and that it can take trading standards some time to get the evidence necessary to enforce a penalty charge notice. I hope the Government will see their way to considering extending the period from six to 12 months.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000366"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 138 attempts to increase the amount of money an estate agent can be fined or penalised for not being a member of a redress scheme from &#163;500 to &#163;1,000. In the grand scheme of things, even &#163;1,000 is a pretty small sum. If we take the average price of a house to be about &#163;150,000&#151;for heaven&#146;s sake, I do not believe that is right; someone gave me that figure, but it is far more than that&#151;then on a normal estate agent&#146;s commission, that means an estate agent gets about &#163;3,000. I hope my arithmetic is right. If we then move to house prices in the more expensive areas, we will find estate agents&#146; commissions of &#163;10,000 or even more. Set against those kinds of sums, even &#163;1,000 is pretty small beer. Five hundred pounds is in danger of being so small that it seems a trivial amount; so trivial that people will say, &#147;We can absorb this&#148;. I hope the Minister will give us some comfort regarding this. Actually, I think even &#163;1,000 is too low, but I do not want to get into an argument with myself in front of the Committee&#151;not that arguing with oneself in front of the Committee is that unusual, but I do not intend to embark upon that here and now.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000367"></a>What happens if someone is in breach? Can the trading standards office levy repeat fines on a non-complying estate agent? In other words, if an estate agent is liable for one of these notices and the fine is only &#163;500, could the trading standards people repeat the process? That is not very satisfactory, though; it is better to levy a fine at a decent level once and for all.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000368"></a>Could these notices be issued per instruction taken by an estate agent, rather than only per property sold? That is because estate agents take instruction on many more occasions than individual properties get sold. I do not know that, but I am told it is the case. Maybe it would be an additional safeguard if the Minister were to move somewhat in that direction.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000369"></a>I believe that Amendments No. 133 and 138 are fairly minor matters in the scheme of things, but they would certainly help to improve the whole process. Obviously, they are here as probing amendments, and I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000370"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010983000497"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> I support my noble friend Lady Wilcox, and in particular her Amendments Nos. 128, 134, 135 and 136. I declare an interest as chairman and chief executive of an insurance broking and independent financial advisers&#146; organisation. I have lectured and written on insurance and financial services subjects. I have also been involved with the arrangement of mortgages and have dealt with estate agents. With regard to my own business, both the financial services and the general insurance activities are authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. That encompasses not only licensing, but procedures relating to redress and dispute resolution.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000371"></a>I broadly welcome the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill. Buying or selling a property is likely to be the most significant transaction in most people&#146;s lives, and can involve a great deal of stress and anxiety. In view of that, the consumer needs assurance that the market is transparent. Estate agents play a critical role in the housing market, with over 90 per cent of people buying and selling a house through them.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000372"></a>I believe that most estate agents are honest, although sadly a few rogue agents give the rest a bad name. It is vital for the good of the industry that there is seen to be a code of practice behind any redress system approved by the Office of Fair Trading, which ensures universal high standards and encourages transparent and effective practice within the industry. It also needs to send a clear message to the small number of estate agents who do not live up to our highest expectations.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000373"></a>Professionalism, the raising of standards and the need to protect consumers are matters vital to estate agency. It has been seen by some as a slightly shoddy profession on occasions, because of a lack of a single set of standards. I welcome the compulsion for all agents to belong to a redress scheme, but concur with my noble friend that there needs to be a clear set of  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>standards that all schemes adhere to. There is a voluntary ombudsman scheme for estate agents, the Ombudsman for Estate Agents, but only about 66 per cent of estate agents are members. If an agent does not belong to the scheme, the only remedy currently available to a consumer is to seek compensation through the courts, which is, of course, expensive and time consuming.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000374"></a>The single code of practice should help to give the profession a better image. Research by <I>Which?</I> in June 2006 showed that over eight in 10 people think the Government should set up an independent body to deal with complaints about estate agents, while in March 2004 an Office of Fair Trading report found that one-quarter of sellers were dissatisfied with the service provided by their estate agents. Some 21 per cent of sellers and 23 per cent of buyers said they had experienced a serious problem with their agent, such as failure to pass on offers, suggesting that a buyer would be more likely to be successful if they also used the financial services offered by the agent, and failure by the agent to declare a personal interest. Of those, 71 per cent of sellers and 55 per cent of buyers complained. In the majority of cases, nothing happened or the complaint was not resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000375"></a>Consumer dissatisfaction with estate agents is increasing. In 2005 the OEA received 6,021 complaints&#151;a 35 per cent increase on the number received in 2000. That represents about one complaint for every four estate agents. That, surely, would suggest that a single system of redress should cover all estate agents, should be seen to set high best practice standards and should be seen to have real teeth.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000376"></a><b><a name="70109-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010983000498"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> I shall speak to Amendment No. 123A, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, the amendments to Schedule 6 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and the two amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Dubs.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000377"></a>The first amendment seeks to extend Section 1 of the Estate Agents Act to cover lettings work. As noble Lords are aware, the provisions in the Bill are based on the OFT&#146;s report on the estate agency market. The report did not look at lettings, rentals and property management, and hence does not provide an evidence base for extending redress to those sectors. In addition, the provisions amend the Estate Agents Act 1979 which applies only to those engaged in estate agency work. This is a defined term in the Act that does not extend to lettings work, rentals or property management. The Act would require a major overhaul to be fit for purpose to apply to agents engaged in lettings work and so on, and that is not the purpose of the current Bill.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000378"></a>However, the Government have already taken steps to improve the regulation of the lettings sector. The Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme, which will start on 6 April 2007, will require landlords of assured shorthold tenancies&#151;the most common form of new tenancy&#151;who take deposits to join a statutory tenants deposit scheme. Deposits will be safeguarded and tenants who keep their property in good condition will be entitled to get their deposits back. The scheme also  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provides independent mediation when disputes arise. It applies equally to agents doing lettings work where they take deposits on behalf of landlords. This will address one of the major causes of dispute in the lettings sector. I can assure noble Lords that the Government will continue to monitor the operation of the private rented sector and the property sector more generally to determine whether there is a market failure which should be addressed by future legislation.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000379"></a>I turn now to the drafting amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. The first amendment seeks to make the power to make an order to require estate agents to belong to a redress scheme subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I should like to reassure noble Lords about the content of this order. The policy intention is for the order to apply to all those engaged in estate agency work in the UK in connection with buying and selling residential property. There is no intention to apply this only to a narrow subsection of estate agents or types of complaint. The drafting of the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 123A simply gives the same flexibility as the Housing Act 2004 to deal with scope issues which may arise in the future. Subsection (3) gives essential flexibility to exclude frivolous or vexatious complaints, and to exclude complaints from commercial organisations buying residential property, as the policy intention of the redress provisions is to cover private individuals buying a home. On that basis we do not expect the order to contain anything controversial, and I am happy to reassure noble Lords on this point.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000380"></a>If noble Lords disagree, the negative resolution procedure does of course allow the order to be debated if that is considered necessary. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was content for the order to be subject to the negative procedure. In addition, making it subject to the affirmative procedure would make it out of step with the redress order under Part 2 of the Bill and with the Housing Act. There are good reasons to use the negative procedure here as it will give estate agents much more certainty about when the order will come into force. I hope that noble Lords will agree that it is helpful if those in the industry have a good idea of the timescale in which they must join a redress scheme. As both of the opposition parties have signalled their agreement to the principle of all estate agents dealing in residential property to be required to belong to a redress scheme, I hope that I have been able to give a reassurance on this point.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000381"></a>Amendment No. 134 seeks to amend paragraph (1) of new Schedule 3. It states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010983000421"></a>&#147;A redress scheme may be approved ... by the OFT acting in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 8&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010983000400"></a>The purpose of these provisions as drafted is to confer a power on the OFT to approve schemes and to ensure that the OFT acts in accordance with the criteria listed in sub-paragraphs (2) to (8) when doing so. It is appropriate that only a power is conferred since, for example, the criteria listed in sub-paragraphs (2) to (8) are not satisfied or if the OFT feels that a further redress scheme, even one that met the other criteria,  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would cause confusion for consumers and/or estate agents. The office feels that it must be able to refuse to grant approval.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000382"></a>On Amendment No. 135, the drafting of a code of practice was deliberate. The code was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. There may be more than one code of practice which the ombudsman may use as the basis for complaints against estate agents. I am sure noble Lords would agree that it is right to retain the ability of an ombudsman to refer to more than one code of practice. There is the issue of best practice, rather than good practice. For the reasons that I outlined in our earlier discussion, I would be happy to consider this amendment further to see whether we can adopt it.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000383"></a>Amendments Nos. 133 and 138, tabled by my noble friend Lord Dubs, who has considerable expertise in this area and who was a pioneer in previously sponsoring the Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Estate Agents (Independent Redress Schemes) Bill, seek to strengthen the penalty charge arrangements in one of their applications. I applaud my noble friend&#146;s intent. However, the rationale behind a penalty charge notice is to give an immediate punishment and an incentive to comply with the duty to belong to a redress scheme. Perhaps I may elaborate: there is a six-month time limit for issuing penalty charge notices, as enforcers need to take prompt action within a reasonable timescale. The point of the six-month period is that the penalty charge can be issued within that six month period, or in the case of a continuing breach, on the last day of that breach being committed. The six-month period is to encourage prompt action against any estate agents who are acting improperly. The current view of the Government is that a 12-month period would perhaps encourage a delay in taking effective action. However, the six-month rule does not mean that action cannot be taken later&#151;it can be. My noble friend also asked whether those penalty charges could be imposed more than once. Yes they can, and there is the ultimate sanction of the estate agent being banned. That is why we currently feel that the six-month period is about right.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000384"></a>The amount of the fine needs to strike a balance between being a significant sum and recognising that it can be imposed on the spot with very little due process involved. If the sum was much larger, we would have to consider whether it would be more appropriate for the penalty to be linked to a criminal offence enforced through the magistrates&#146; court. Furthermore, the ultimate penalty for not being a member is a heavy sanction&#151;being banned from being an estate agent.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000385"></a>The other point is that the size of the penalty charge and the length of time are both consistent with the Housing Act and strike the right balance; but it is of course a matter of judgment. I should also point out that the penalty charge regime related to information pack redress under the Housing Act 2004 is drawn up in similar terms.</p>

<p><a name="07010983000387"></a>I am grateful for the support of my noble friend Lady Wilcox. As I said, she was going to come to the boil and she started to come nicely. We will expect more at Report and I, too, support her amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is absolutely right; he knows more about estate agents than even I do as a consultant to them. I felt that there was much merit in his amendments. When it came to the matter of the fine, the Minister suggested that &#163;500 was significant to an estate agent. Even with the sort of figures that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is talking about, let alone for someone who is selling a property in central London, that would hardly fill up the tank of petrol of one of their Chelsea tractors. My noble friend made some very useful points that were equally applicable to my Amendment No. 123, which we will come back to.</p>

<a name="70109-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010983000388"></a>I have to say to the Minister that I was very saddened by what he said. He said that the report of the Office of Fair Trading, on which this part of the Bill is based, did not look at residential letting or management and that updating the 1979 Act in this respect is not the purpose of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is the protection of the consumer. I could not care less  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether it updates the 1979, the 1981 or the 1953 Act; it is for the protection of the consumer. That is what we are not doing. The whole purpose of my Amendment No. 123 is to give the consumer greater protection. If it means updating part of the 1979 Act and that is not at the moment the Government&#146;s intention, so be it as far as I am concerned. I am grateful to the Minister for the rest of his reply. It was just that bit of wording that got to me. His officials took their eye slightly off what we are trying to do with the Bill, which is to give consumer protection.</p>

<a name="07010963000014"></a><b><a name="70109-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010963000096"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Economic Secretary (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07010963000015"></a>Budget 2006 announced that the second Comprehensive Spending Review would be informed by a series of policy reviews. One of the reviews announced at the Budget was a joint HM Treasury and Department for Education and Skills policy review of children and young people. A discussion paper setting out the evidence collected to date by this review is published today and is available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07010963000016"></a>The Government&#146;s approach has transformed the life chances of children since 1997. For example, 700,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty in the six years to 2004-05; 98 per cent of three and four year-olds have taken up the national entitlement to free early years education and government action has improved primary and secondary school standards. However, in <I>Support for parents: the best start for children</I>, published at the 2005 Pre-Budget Report, HM Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills identified further steps to be taken to improve the outcomes for children and young people.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07010963000017"></a>The discussion paper, published today, sets out and evaluates the evidence collected to date to inform the review's work to consider how services for children and young people and their families can build on the three principles identified in <I>Support for parents: the best start for children</I>&#151;rights and responsibilities, progressive universalism and prevention&#151;to improve outcomes for children and young people.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07010963000018"></a>Under the umbrella of the children and young people's review, sub-reviews are considering:</p>
what strategy should be adopted over the next  10 years to deliver a step change in youth services and support for young people;how services for families and children at risk of becoming locked in a cycle of low achievement, high harm and high cost can be reformed to deliver better outcomes; andhow services can provide greater support to families with disabled children to improve their life chances.
<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07010963000019"></a>The review will report in spring 2007 with recommendations to inform and influence the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07010963000020"></a><b><a name="70109-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07010963000097"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Statement.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS6"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column WS6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07010963000021"></a>Since my last Statement in July, there has been further progress on debt relief for poor countries.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07010963000022"></a>Debt cancellation, under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), was implemented at the African Development Fund (AfDF) of the African Development Bank on 1 September 2006, with relief backdated to 1 January 2006. The MDRI agreement at Gleneagles has therefore now been delivered at the IMF, the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank and at the AfDF. Over  $38 billion (approximately &#163;20 billion) of debts for 21 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), as well as two other non-HIPCs, Cambodia and Tajikistan at the IMF, have now been cancelled under the MDRI. A further 22 countries will have their debts cancelled when they complete the HIPC process.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07010963000023"></a>There are many good examples of the use countries are making of their savings under the MDRI<sup>1</sup>. Cameroon is using the $29.8 million of savings it will gain from the MDRI in 2006 for national poverty reduction priorities, including infrastructure, social sector and governance reforms. Uganda is using its $57.9 million savings in 2006 on improving energy infrastructure to try to ease acute electricity shortages, as well as primary education, malaria control, healthcare and water infrastructure (specifically targeting the poor and under-served villages). Zambia is using its savings of $23.8 million under the MDRI in 2006 to increase spending on agricultural projects on smallholder irrigation and livestock disease control, as well as to eliminate fees for healthcare in rural areas.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07010963000024"></a>There has also been good progress in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Some 21 countries have now completed the HIPC initiative, with Malawi and Sierra Leone the most recent to do so, in August and December 2006 respectively. Upon reaching HIPC completion point, Malawi and  Sierra Leone received 100 per cent bilateral debt cancellation from the UK, as well as debt cancellation under HIPC and the MDRI. Haiti reached HIPC decision point in November and will now receive interim debt relief. Debt relief worth $61.2 billion has been delivered or committed for 30 countries under HIPC to date.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07010963000025"></a>The UK remains committed to the full financing and implementation of HIPC and the MDRI. We have recently contributed &#163;10 million to the HIPC Trust Fund towards the costs of debt cancellation for Malawi at the AfDB, and made a generous pledge towards the trust fund's overall financing needs in the next three to four years. The UK will also contribute &#163;1.3 million towards the costs of clearing the Central African Republic (CAR)&#146;s arrears to the African Development Bank, an essential prerequisite for the bank's re-engagement in the country and for CAR to qualify for debt relief in due course.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07010963000026"></a>Last autumn, after strong lobbying by the UK, the international community agreed to remove the requirement (known as the HIPC sunset clause) that countries must have started a programme of support with the IMF by the end of 2006 to remain eligible for  


<notus-date day="9" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS7"></a><b>9 Jan 2007 : Column WS7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debt relief. All 13 countries that have yet to reach HIPC decision point will therefore still be able to qualify for debt relief.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07010963000027"></a>The UK supports debt relief for all poor countries&#151;not just HIPCs&#151;that would use the savings to progress towards the millennium development goals. We therefore continue to offer debt relief (reimbursements of 10 per cent of debt service payments to IDA and the AfDF) to qualifying low-income countries under the UK Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Moldova recently qualified for this assistance, bringing the total number of recipients to seven countries.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07010963000028"></a>The UK is working with the World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank and other development partners to ensure that countries that have benefited from debt relief can access the financing they need to reach the millennium development goals, without re-accumulating unsustainable levels of debt. The joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) provides guidance on new borrowing and lending to low-income countries. Countries that may struggle to repay loans receive grants from the World Bank and African Development Bank instead. The UK is also leading efforts among export credit agencies (ECAs) to agree new guidelines on responsible lending to countries that have received debt relief. It is important that borrowers and lenders work together to ensure any new borrowing is appropriately concessional, well targeted and used for productive purposes.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="07010963000030"></a><b><a name="70109-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07010963000098"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Truscott):</b> My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Jim Fitzpatrick) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07010963000031"></a>The Enterprise Act 2002 introduced a new financial regime for the Insolvency Service as from  1 April 2004. One feature of this new regime has been the use of general taxation to cover the cost of the service's enforcement functions; for example, work on director disqualification, bankruptcy restrictions orders and the reporting of criminal offences. Funds have been provided by way of the Department of Trade and Industry's (DTI) programme vote. In the light of the continued need for government to concentrate their resources on high-priority areas such as health, education, science and the environment, the DTI, like other departments, has been seeking ways in which to more efficiently allocate scant resources. Part of this process has  been to identify areas where different funding arrangements might be introduced.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07010963000032"></a>Therefore, from 1 April 2007 the cost of the investigation work done by official receivers and their staffs on disqualifications, bankruptcy restrictions orders and on reporting possible criminal offences will not be met by way of programme expenditure but will be recovered through fees charged to estates. As a

This will enable expenditure on enforcement work to proceed at planned levels in 2007-08 and enforcement outputs, particularly disqualification and bankruptcy restrictions orders, to increase significantly.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07010963000034"></a>With the expiry of the call-out order made last January, a new order has been made under Section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called out into service to support operations in Iraq. The new order is valid for 12 months. Some 640 reservists are currently mobilised to support operations in Iraq. We are very appreciative of the continuing support and commitment shown by both reservists and their employers.</p>

As part of the ongoing preparation of these reforms my department will consult in spring 2007 on the detailed content of  a draft Bill to implement the Law Commission's recommendations. This consultation will include consideration of the issue of giving the court powers to allow it to hear certain cases beyond current limitation periods, allowing the victim to sue if the offender later receives a windfall, for example. The Government undertook to consult on this in the July 2006 publication, <I>Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System in favour of the law-abiding majority</I>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="07010963000073"></a>The funding will enable these ALMOs to carry on with their crucial work of improving the quality of homes occupied by social rented tenants. The continuation of funding recognises how successful ALMOs are not only in providing new roofs, new windows new kitchens and central heating, but also in delivering better and more efficient services to tenants.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="07010963000074"></a>ALMOs are playing a key role in delivering wider government initiatives. They are supporting the creation of more mixed communities and are creating job opportunities for local people through new apprenticeship and training schemes. They are taking the lead in developing innovative and successful approaches to tackling anti-social behaviour through the respect agenda.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="07010963000075"></a>The resources allocated today are from the funding made available in the 2004 spending review. Throughout the country 56 ALMOs are managing more than 828,000 homes and spending &#163;840 million each year on bringing them up to the Government's decent homes standard through their refurbishing and modernising programmes. Decisions on allocations beyond 2007-08 will be considered in the context of the spending review. I have been impressed with the achievements of the ALMO programme to date and remain committed to our objective of making all social housing decent.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="07010963000077"></a>In his Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor announced that the Government will increase the resource devoted to national minimum wage enforcement. We must ensure that good employers are not put at a competitive disadvantage by those who underpay their workers. I am today publishing our policy to fine employers who ignore an official demand to pay the national minimum wage. We will do this through the consistent issue of penalty notices. This policy will encourage employers to comply with an enforcement notice, and in doing so persuade employers to pay arrears to workers and deter employers from failing to pay national minimum wage in the future. At current rates, a typical penalty for failing to comply with an enforcement notice in respect of underpaying one worker will be over &#163;200.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="07010963000078"></a>We have an escalating enforcement process which ranges from educating employers to criminal prosecutions. Penalty notices sit within this regime. They impose a fine on employers who have ignored an enforcement notice and not paid in full the arrears outlined. They may be issued even if it is the first time an employer has underpaid workers. We have carefully considered the 2005 Low Pay Commission recommendation that the Government should,</p>
<ul><a name="07010963000095"></a>&#147;introduce interest charges payable on arrears arising from minimum wage underpayment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010963000094"></a>We are rejecting this recommendation as we believe penalty notices offer a greater financial incentive to comply, stronger deterrence and greater scope to remove the benefits of non-compliance.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="07010963000079"></a>Our policy to issue penalty notices is from today on the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/employment/pay/national-minimum-wage/index.html. Employers should remember that if they are persistently or wilfully non-compliant with national minimum wage legislation, they will be considered for criminal prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="07010963000083"></a>We are in active dialogue with a school in Scotland and hope we can announce its participation in due course. The MoD will now begin the process of training the teachers and staff from the schools who have volunteered to take part in the pilot scheme. This process will involve attending courses at the Cadet Training Centre, training sessions with the local cadet training teams and participation at cadet camps. This activity will continue through to the summer of 2007. We expect the first pupils to enrol as cadets in the new contingents, as planned, at the start of the academic year 2007-08.</p>

It is this range of personal development and educational opportunities that enables the Combined Cadet Force to stand out among other youth organisations, thereby acting as a genuine force for good for the young people who join, the schools in which they are based as well as for the communities in which they live. We are therefore determined to ensure that this pilot scheme will allow many more young people to enjoy the full cadet experience.</p>

<a name="07010963000089"></a><b><a name="70109-wms0002.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07010963000106"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="07010963000090"></a>The British Government will provide a further  &#163;15 million to support the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) this financial year. The AMIS force of 7,000 carries out vital operations in Darfur, and in very difficult circumstances. It relies on the support of the international community to fund its operations and the UK has been a leading contributor since its deployment.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="07010963000091"></a>A high-level consultation on Darfur was held in Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006. It concluded that the UN needs to provide increased support to AMIS, to enhance its effectiveness and ability to protect the civilians of Darfur and implement the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) signed on 5 May. This UN support will come in three phases, culminating in a joint AU/UN peacekeeping force of 17,000, with 3,000 police. This will require sustainable funding and the UN Secretary-General will request that this come from the UN. In the mean time, the AU Peace and Security Council met on 30 November. It endorsed the Addis conclusions and extended the mandate of AMIS for a further six months from 1 January. But this extension is conditional upon sufficient funding from the international community.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="07010963000092"></a>The African Union estimates the cost of extending AMIS&#146;s mandate to continue its current operations and to implement expansions under the DPA as  $343 million (&#163;175 million). Finding these funds will require a concerted international effort and the UK is fully committed to playing its part. As an important donor to AMIS and in recognition of the urgent  need to sustain its work, the UK will give a further  &#163;15 million to support the force for its extended mandate.</p>

<a name="70109-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="07010963000093"></a>This contribution brings the total British assistance to AMIS for this financial year to  &#163;35 million. The previously committed &#163;20 million has been funding ground fuel contracts, airlift for Nigerian and Rwandan battalions and military observers. It also includes a cash contribution of &#163;13.5 million to cover personnel and catering costs for the period October to December. These are vital running costs for AMIS to continue its operations. As well as taking a lead in committing UK funds, we are also encouraging other donors to make new pledges to sustain the mission.</p>

These figures are based on all completions in the magistrates&#146; courts and will include cases committed to the Crown Court, and cases dismissed or discharged as well as those where a sentence was passed in the magistrates&#146; court. This is because timeliness data broken down by case completion type have been available only since February 1999.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_397"></a><a name="07010967000495"></a>In 2002 a &#147;letter agreement&#148; was put in place to reflect Railtrack's failure to deliver the agreed terms of the west coast modernisation programme. The recently announced agreement puts the Virgin West Coast franchise back on a secure contractual footing and enables the department to secure additional public value by incentivising the operator to reduce costs. Bracketed figures are premia planned to be received by the department.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_398"></a><a name="07010967000496"></a>It is to be noted that the sums paid include actual incentive payments and receipts. The sums paid also include the impact of the ORR regulatory review of track access charges, as do those planned for the reinstated franchise agreement.</p>

<a name="70109w0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_399"></a><a name="07010967000497"></a>The reinstated franchise agreement, unlike the original, includes a revenue share/support arrangement in the eventuality that a target revenue is exceeded/fails to be achieved. This is in accordance with other recent franchises. The Department for Transport will receive 50 per cent of revenues achieved between 102 per cent and 106 per cent of an agreed target revenue and 80 per cent of revenues greater than 106 per cent of target revenue.</p>

<a name="70109w0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_400"></a><a name="07010967000498"></a>Revenue support arrangements are a mirror image of these; that is, should the franchisee fail to achieve between 98 per cent and 100 per cent of target revenues the franchisee will receive no support. Should 94 per cent to 98 per cent of target revenue not be achieved the department pays 50 per cent of that revenue not achieved; it pays 80 per cent should revenues received be less than 94 per cent.</p>
