<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08012455000078"></a>Who is blocking reform? No one is doing so. The problem is acute and difficult. Fishermen cannot control the fish they catch, but they are allowed to land only certain fish for the market. Consequently, they discard those fish that are not marketable; they also discard fish that are less profitable than those that might be caught subsequently on the fishing trip. All these processes build up the possibility of discard. The issue for the European Commission, the community as a whole, and everyone concerned with the welfare of the fishing industry, is how we control this waste, when it is clear that fishermen have a perverse incentive to indulge in it.</p>

<a name="08012455000079"></a><b><a name="80124-0001.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="08012455000637"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, is it not quite clearly the case that New Zealand and Norway have quota systems, like the European Union, which do not allow discards? It is quite possible to do that through the trading of quotas at the end of fishing periods. Is not the real answer to the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, that qualified majority voting is needed to make real progress in the European Union on the common fisheries policy; and does not the European reform treaty, at last, do that?</p>

It is not easy to control discards. I hear what the noble Lord says about Norway and New Zealand being successful. Iceland also has a strong policy in this area. However, there is a great deal of doubt about whether those policies work effectively. We are not sure that banning discards, which the European Commission is looking at very seriously, is the solution to the problem. The British Government&#146;s approach is rather one of encouraging fishermen to employ the appropriate gear for the catch that they intend to take so that they do not, inadvertently, catch other fish that are then subject to discard.</p>

Recently published figures amount to as much as 50 per cent. The fish are caught by large vessels spending years at sea, many of them placed in the Asia Pacific region, hoovering up large quantities of fish.

The noble Lord will appreciate that the European Commission needs to develop a policy that works for those fisheries which are closer to home. It certainly needs to examine the potential abuse identified by the noble Lord. However, inevitably, the main concentration of potential action relates to those fisheries which are in member countries of the European Union.</p>

Equally clearly, however, there was a real danger of certain fishing stocks disappearing entirely. There has been a growth of North Sea cod in the past couple of years and a recovery&#151;not sufficient for the total allowable catch to be greatly increased, but a potential increase of cod&#151;after we had been faced with the danger of it becoming extinct.</p>

The purpose of quotas is presumably to conserve fish stocks. You do not conserve any fish stocks if you net them and kill half of them because you are allowed to land only a few. If that happens, why cannot the fish to be discarded be used for fertiliser or in some form of manufacture?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08012455000115"></a>Three events in the Middle East have had particular significance for me. In 1956, at the time of Suez, I had just joined the Army. I was opposed to the invasion, and in my officers&#146; mess being a national service second lieutenant and opposed to Suez was not a notably popular position. It was not a popular position, but, as it happens, it was right. In 1967, I was a correspondent for the <I>Times</I> in the Middle East war reporting from Beirut and Amman. I returned to Britain saying and writing that the dominating issue was Palestine, but in the wake of the massive Israeli victory, that was also not a message that everybody wanted to hear. It was not popular, but again it was conceivably right.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08012455000116"></a>In the Iraq conflict my connection was rather different. I did not report it but my stepson did. His name is Oliver Poole and some of your Lordships with long memories may recognise he has the unique disadvantage of having both his grandfather and his stepfather as chairmen of the Conservative Party. At the start of the conflict I listened to him from Iraq&#151;these days communications are so much easier than through the old cable offices&#151;as he made his way with a tank unit from the Kuwait border to Baghdad among American soldiers who had been told that they would be welcomed as liberators. I followed the position as it deteriorated. Where once at the beginning a journalist could go on to the streets of Baghdad to collect material, the position rapidly changed. Travelling security became essential and interviews were constrained to 20 minutes in case news should spread that there was a western journalist in the area. I read of the tragedies: of his hotel blown up, killing not western journalists but Iraqis living nearby; of the destruction in 2006 of one of Shia Islam&#146;s holiest shrines, the Golden Mosque in Samarra, and the retaliation in Baghdad against Sunni mosques there; of neighbours who had lived side by side for generations turning on each other; of militia growing up both to defend and to attack; and of course of the indiscriminate murder and torture practised on both sides, leading to plans announced in Baghdad for the construction of two new morgues to cope with the influx of bodies.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08012455000117"></a>For me there was a major question. Unlike my noble friend Lord Hurd who opposed the invasion from the outset, I, like so many people in this country, had supported the Government&#146;s decision. I had even written to both the Prime Minister and the then Foreign Secretary, supporting them in their efforts to persuade Parliament and the United Nations. I had never done that before and probably will never do it again. It can of course be said, &#147;What right have you, someone who initially supported the invasion, to ask questions now?&#148;. My reply is that in some ways people like me have even more right. Not unreasonably, we trusted the information we were given by the Government. We expected, and had to every right to expect, that proper plans would be made not just for the war but for what would follow. We assumed that Ministers had taken account of the skilled Foreign Office advice available and that decisions were made having proper regard to this advice. We now know that some of those conditions were not met and that, at least in some respects, the public were misled. We know that the weapons of

We also know that the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, substantially overstated his case. On 23 August 2002 the United Kingdom intelligence community told the Prime Minister that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000539"></a>&#147;we ... know little about Iraq&#146;s chemical and biological weapons work since late 1998&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000472"></a>Just over a month later the Prime Minister told the Commons that the picture painted by our intelligence services was,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000540"></a>&#147;extensive, detailed and authoritative&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000473"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, who I see in his place, said in our debate in February 2007:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08012455000507"></a>&#147;Those words could simply not have been justified by the material that the intelligence community provided to him&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/2/07; col. 1231.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08012455000118"></a>I certainly acknowledge the improvement in the security position recently in Baghdad. I also acknowledge that some benefits have resulted from the invasion. The position in Kurdistan is much improved and above all there is the removal of Saddam Hussein, who not only murdered his own people but had already been responsible for the conflict over Kuwait in 1991 and much more. I weep no tears for him but his overthrow alone does not provide legal justification for military intervention and certainly it does not cancel out the massive consequences of the invasion which in my view makes out the case for an inquiry.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08012455000119"></a>First and foremost, there have been the casualties of this conflict&#151;the British troops who have been killed and injured. Regiments such as the Royal Anglians, of which my old regiment is now part, have suffered badly. I pay tribute to their courage and that of all the forces that have fought in Iraq over the past five years. But of course the chief casualties have been among the Iraqis themselves. Some have died in the fighting, some have died in the sectarian murders that have accompanied the fighting, and some have died in the criminality which we have been unable to control. No one knows exactly how many have died. A conservative estimate is 100,000, but there may well be many thousands more; I doubt that there have been fewer. We do know that death has often been accompanied by torture, and that fear has taken hold to such an extent that 2 million Iraqis have been displaced in their own country. Even worse, more than 2 million have fled to surrounding countries such as Syria, Jordan and the Lebanon. The refugees have gained a degree of safety, but at a price. Families have been uprooted and have struggled to survive without jobs and with dwindling or non-existent savings.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08012455000120"></a>In short, the conflict has created the worst refugee crisis in the Middle East since 1948. Against this background, the public in this country, whatever their original stance, are entitled to ask a number of questions which an inquiry is best placed to put. They are entitled to ask for more detail on how the decision to invade was reached. I was a member of the Cabinet at the time of the Falklands. Events moved very quickly after the Argentine invasion, but not so quickly that it was impossible to arrange a full Cabinet meeting at which the Prime Minister asked each of us in turn whether we agreed to the task force being sent. The issue was debated and an alternative view was put.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08012455000121"></a>Recently, Mr Blair gave a lengthy television interview in which his impatience with the checks and balances of the Cabinet system of government came over loud and clear. In essence, his case was that it could get in the way of action. Of course it is true that it can, but equally it is true that it can act as a corrective to prevent unwise action. Governments usually get into trouble when collective judgment is replaced by the informal meeting of small groups.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08012455000122"></a>At the same time, I would like to know about the nature of the Foreign Office advice. I do not claim for a moment that Ministers should automatically take that advice, although in the policies of the Middle East they would well advised to give it some weight, but the public should be reassured that the full advice reached Ministers and was discussed by them. I hope that, as has been suggested, the Foreign Office was not simply sidelined in this decision. Secondly, the public are entitled to ask what planning took place for the aftermath. It is all very well saying that this was all down to the Americans, but that casts doubt on the whole nature of the alliance.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08012455000123"></a>Britain has an obvious history in Iraq, and some knowledge based on that experience and experience elsewhere. Surely that knowledge should have been put to some use, or did we believe that our troops would be welcomed as liberating forces and not forces of occupation? I assume not, but I acknowledge that there is conflicting evidence here and that a former British ambassador, Christopher Segar, told the <I>Guardian</I> this week that British officials underestimated the prospect of insurgency and that British Ministers failed to ask for detailed analysis of the consequences of an invasion. For whatever reason, the planning for this stage seems to have been woefully inadequate, and although the security position in Baghdad has now improved, it is still a long way from what we want. Marie Colvin, a very brave reporter for the <I>Sunday Times</I> who was in Basra without military protection a month ago, reported that she found Islamic militias now waging a brutal campaign for control.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08012455000124"></a>Thirdly, an inquiry should examine the British response to the massive refugee problem caused by the conflict. We owe a particular duty here. Has our response has been sufficient, or have we relied too heavily on the resources of a country such as Jordan, which already has existing refugee problems to tackle, as I saw a few months ago when I was there?</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08012455000125"></a>I say to the Minister that the reassurances we heard at Question Time in this House on Monday do not sit altogether easily with the response of the United Nations refugee agency. A few days ago, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that the UNHCR would welcome greater support from donor Governments, including the United Kingdom, for its operations in the region, and that it would like further direct bilateral support for the two main countries of asylum, Syria and Jordan. Looking back on 2007, the UN refugee agency said that it received &#163;3.51 million from the United Kingdom, against its &#163;62 million Iraq region budget, while no United Kingdom funds were forthcoming towards the agency&#146;s health and education programmes, jointly implemented with WHO and UNICEF.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08012455000126"></a>Another part of the refugee problem is the future of the interpreters and other staff who have helped the British and have consequently put themselves and their families in danger. As the House will know, I have raised this issue on a number of occasions, first in April 2007. The problem is limited in size, but seems symbolic of our attitude. It took until last October for the Government to announce a scheme, but it is carefully limited and constrained. So far, it has helped very few and all the guidance appears to be worded to deter applications to come to this country, rather than help some very brave people. Not all the interpreters who work for the British work for the British Government. For example, there are the interpreters working for the correspondents of British media organisations. Shamefully, their best prospect of resettlement is in the United States under a scheme run by the Americans. The question remains of whether, even now, five years later, we are facing up to our responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08012455000127"></a>Finally, the public are certainly entitled to ask whether our troops have always been properly equipped and supported for the conflict. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Walker of Aldringham, when he said in our February debate that there must be a covenant between Government and the Armed Forces&#151;an unwritten contract that, in return for the sacrifice made by those in the forces, the Government ensure that they are equipped properly, given the best possible care and treated fairly. There are, in this House, far greater experts than me in this area; one of them is sitting next to me. I hope that this contract has been honoured.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08012455000128"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Hurd, I believe that issues such as this should be investigated by a committee of privy counsellors together with others with expert knowledge. It is right that it should be a committee answerable to Parliament. It is certainly not the occasion for a lengthy judicial inquiry, such as that into Bloody Sunday, or, for that matter, the marathon of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott. The focus of such an inquiry should not be on blame, but on learning the lessons&#151;lessons which might help us in formulating policy elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80124-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08012455000129"></a>To be fair to the Government, they have not set their face totally against an inquiry. Rather, they have sought to smother the call by setting out a range of less demanding options. In the debate last February the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, gave the response that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000541"></a>&#147;nobody has set their mind against an inquiry or some form of debate and discussion of these fundamental policy issues in the long term&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/02/07; col. 1255. ]</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000474"></a>I do not find that reassuring and I hope the message of this House will be that only an inquiry will do, and that the Government will give a more solid reply today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08012455000130"></a>I also hope that the Government will not take refuge in the argument that nothing can happen until all our troops come home. Among the precedents is the inquiry into the operations of the war in the Dardanelles. It was set up in July 1916 in the middle of the First World War, with Britain directly threatened, under a Bill introduced in the Commons by the then  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_343"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Prime Minister, Mr Asquith. Our troop numbers in Iraq are now reduced to about 4,500, which is radically fewer than three, four and five years ago. I in no way devalue their role but I simply reject the argument that they will be demoralised by such an inquiry. Conceivably, an inquiry could help for the future and aid those troops who follow. But if nothing is done until the very last soldier returns, action could be deferred for years to come.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08012455000131"></a>We are almost at the fifth anniversary of the start of this conflict. Many of the players have already given their accounts&#151;Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell and Sir Michael Jackson. We have also had investigations, such as that of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, which have shone a light on particular issues. Surely, the time has come for a comprehensive inquiry, while memories are reasonably fresh, so that the lessons from these momentous events can be learnt. I see no reason for further delay. The time for an inquiry is now. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

There have been many debates in the House calling for such an inquiry, which have been defeated. One may not like the results, but there have been those discussions. I concede also that the response of the Government has been, as the noble Lord said, somewhat unclear. At one time we were told that there would be an inquiry, but only when the time was right and the troops have been withdrawn&#151;but how many troops and when? It begs many questions.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08012455000133"></a>I am very doubtful about the wisdom of an inquiry. The precedents are not good. The Falklands commission was a rather unhappy commission of about six months and the results were not particularly valuable. It is obviously difficult to limit the time. The noble Lord has ruled out a Saville-type Bloody Sunday inquiry, but probably only the lawyers benefited, save of course that it was of benefit to the public in that it was part of that process which led to the ultimate settlement in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08012455000134"></a>An inquiry can go on for a very long time. Indeed, the noble Lord has given it a vast agenda&#151;from refugees to the preparedness of our troops to the advice given to the Prime Minister beforehand and so on, which could take a long time. The noble Lord seems to have ruled out a judicial inquiry. Even a parliamentary inquiry could take some time. There have already been at least two parliamentary inquiries: namely, that of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which I had the privilege to chair&#151;we said, quite properly, that we were deprived of many of the sources of information and, therefore, were not able to give conclusions as clearly as we would have liked; and that of the Intelligence and Security Committee. The intelligence side was covered by the noble Lord, Lord Butler. One may not like the conclusions, but they largely exonerated the Government.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08012455000135"></a>Clearly, the question is whether it was right to invade. The Government decided that it was. The Security Council and the important countries of the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_344"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European Union said otherwise. This is a political matter, and it is the job of Parliament and the Select Committees appointed by Parliament to do their job. We were also in many ways&#151;and we remain&#151;the junior partner of the United States. An inquiry could also look at our relationship with the United States. There clearly was a plan. The question was whether its execution was faulty. What is the position as regards reconstruction? The noble Lord said that there is currently evidence of some improvement in the military and security situation and in the economic situation there. The danger is that any inquiry would not add to our store of knowledge and would give more heat than light.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08012455000136"></a>We know of the problems today that have arisen from the invasion. We do not know, and cannot by definition know, what would have happened if there had been no action. Were there no invasion, that also would have had certain consequences. It may only have been deferring the conflict. The containment policy was certainly unravelling by 2002 and 2003. There was increasing defiance of the international community and oil sanctions. Oil smuggling was increasing. Had there not been an invasion, Saddam Hussein would probably still be there, torturing his people and preparing the way for one of his nasty sons to succeed him. We might now be dealing with an Iraq possessing nuclear weapons, rather than an Iran potentially seeking them.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08012455000137"></a>The temptation is for us all to re-fight those old battles, the debates of 2002 and 2003, but we are where we are. There is a real danger of a diversion of time and talent in an inquiry. The criticisms of the United States are clear. The first two orders of the CPA were the de-Baathification that led to taking so many trained administrators from the scene and the disbandment of the army that let loose many hundreds and thousands of armed men into the community. With the civil service, the pensions policy that has just been voted in will at least go some way to address the faults there.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08012455000138"></a>There was, as we know, a plan in the US&#151;the 13-volume <I>Future of Iraq</I> project&#151;that was apparently overruled by political appointees in the Pentagon, relying on Chalabi and other exiles. I recall meeting Richard Perle, who some thought of as the puppet-master of the neocons in the Department of Defense. He told me that there would be enormous joy at liberation&#151;perhaps not church bells, this being Iraq, but flowers and greetings. Everything would happen thereafter without any serious planning. Certainly, the State Department had been overruled. There is clearly considerable criticism of the early days of the CPA.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08012455000139"></a>Equally, we failed to appreciate the run-down nature of the physical infrastructure in Iraq&#151;the electricity, the sewerage, the transport, petroleum&#151;after many years of sanctions. There were many unintended consequences of the invasion, not least the way in which Iran has attained regional dominance. If many of us made misjudgments at the time, we can comfort ourselves in part that many of the opponents of the war made equally massive misjudgments in terms of the scale of refugee flows. As the noble Lord said, the scale of the refugee problem has been awful. Yet internal civil war, the division of Iraq and regional war were forecast by a number of opponents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08012455000140"></a>Of the lessons for the British Government, just a few headlines include having a greater sense of history and local knowledge, and not imagining that a country is a tabula rasa. Cabinet government is important, as the noble Lord has said, with checks and balances, not least those parliamentary. European Union colleagues were jealous of what our Foreign Affairs Committee and other committees in the other place were able to accomplish compared to the opportunities that they had. Then, certainly, there is intelligence. Clearly, the Prime Minister had much intelligence. It is a matter of public knowledge that I was given that same intelligence, and perhaps the only fault was in not asking sufficient questions of it, as we were clearly deficient in human intelligence.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08012455000141"></a>There were other major questions about pre-emptive strikes and relations between this country and the United States. Clearly, there have been withering criticisms, but there are now some improvements&#151;certainly in the military&#151;after the surge and the so-called &#147;Anbar awakening&#148;. There has been very limited success politically; there is still a winner-takes-all ethos, and major questions are unresolved. We need to have dialogue with the regional players and particularly not to go for regime change in Iran as part of policy but have dialogue with that country, as we have done with North Korea. There are positive developments on the ground but the plea is that one should look forward on the basis of the current realities rather than turn over stones of what we failed to do in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08012455000143"></a>The minority view is that military action, despite the death of 150,000 civilians in the 40 months following the coalition invasion in March 2003 and the destruction and misery heaped on Iraq, with 2 million refugees, was justified as it removed an evil, tyrannical regime. Clearly that was the opinion of our former Prime Minister, and appears to remain so. But the majority view, admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, is that the invasion was a huge mistake for Iraq and the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08012455000144"></a>To this day, we do not really know what Bush&#146;s motivation was&#151;finishing a job for father, revenge for 9/11, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, oil, Middle East domination or some combination. However, it is accepted that Tony Blair gave a very early commitment to back the United States invasion, a combination of supporting our major ally and a rather simplistic belief, perhaps, that Saddam Hussein had to be deposed and that once removed our forces would be welcomed with open arms.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08012455000145"></a>Three fundamental mistakes were made. First, too few troops were committed initially, with Rumsfeld seemingly overruling so many of his military advisers. Secondly, post-invasion, the Iraqi army was disbanded,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_346"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thereby removing the means to provide some form of discipline and control over the population. Thirdly, as has been mentioned, very little thought was given to the post-invasion needs of the country and the means of delivery and reconstruction.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08012455000146"></a>It is not clear how much knowledge the US and the United Kingdom have of the Iraqi religious groupings or the likely effect of an invasion on Islamist thinking. After all, we had no embassy in Baghdad in Saddam&#146;s final 12 years of rule. What has become apparent is how little interest our then political leaders took in trying to find any of this out. As the famous letter&#151;from 52 of our former senior British diplomats on 27 April 2004&#151;sent to Tony Blair said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08012455000508"></a>&#147;The conduct of the war in Iraq has made it clear that there was no effective plan for the post-Saddam settlement.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08012455000509"></a>&#147;All those with experience of the area predicted that the occupation of Iraq by the Coalition forces would meet serious and stubborn resistance, as has proved to be the case.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08012455000510"></a>&#147;To describe the resistance as led by terrorists, fanatics and foreigners is neither convincing nor helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08012455000147"></a>If we got it wrong, the French got it right. Dominic de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, declared in a speech to the United Nations Security Council two weeks before the invasion:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08012455000512"></a>&#147;We believe that the use of force can arouse rancour and hatred, fuel a clash of identities and cultures&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000475"></a>Jacques Chirac argued in an article in <I>Time</I> magazine:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08012455000513"></a>&#147;A war of this kind cannot help giving a big lift to terrorism. It would create a large number of little bin Ladens&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08012455000148"></a>It seems extraordinary that Britain and France&#151;two major, sophisticated allies, only 20 miles apart, in the 21st century and both with colonial histories&#151;could reach such fundamentally different conclusions on the advisability of military action. Those on these Benches broadly took the French position. Not only did the conflict cause such misery in Iraq, it also has put a heavy strain on our Armed Forces, causing many deaths and serious injuries. To put it bluntly, the British public were conned into going to war and now a further wedge has been driven between them and their political leaders in terms of trust, with all parliamentarians the losers.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08012455000149"></a>Much has been said about overstretch and the pressures on the defence budget. There seems little possibility of any significant increase in defence expenditure&#151;none of our political parties is advocating this. Given our ongoing commitments, particularly in Afghanistan, and with a very unsettled world, we have to eschew unilateral military action in future, other than perhaps in very limited circumstances. We have to work more closely with our allies, particularly the French, to avoid another Iraq-type schism. I accept that in the de Gaulle era and beyond, military co-operation with the French was difficult&#151;even now, protectionism prevails in their defence procurement. But a new French president presents a new opportunity. With an Anglo-French summit in March, and with France assuming the EU presidency in July, it is time to hold out the hand of military co-operation. Let us bring France into the integrated military structure. We never want a repeat of the Iraqi fallout and there are huge gains to be had if we can co-operate militarily with France.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08012455000150"></a>In Iraq, military conflict and insurgent attacks on coalition forces seem to be subsiding. It appears that the US military surge, and the strategy of General Petraeus, have been successful, particularly in turning some of the factions&#151;and all credit for that. However, it is questionable what our limited forces, based at Basra airport, are achieving, and we would like to see them home sooner rather than later. Although the military scene offers some hope, the job of reconstruction and democratic nation rebuilding will clearly take years, set against the background of deep tribal and religious differences, and of adjacent nations pursuing their own agendas. Military action is relatively easy to start&#151;the consequences can last for generations.</p>

Some criticism has been justified, but much has not. He deserves congratulation for the measured way in which he has dealt with the crisis in Iraq since becoming Prime Minister. It is not easy to run your forces down, to reassess and consolidate. But we have done this and now have a better balance in our relationship with the United States. We now face the difficult question of how much further to go. America&#146;s ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, is a very sensible man. He was quoted in last Saturday&#146;s <I>Times</I><I></I>as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08012455000514"></a>&#147;We are in an immeasurably better place in January 2008 than in January 2007&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000476"></a>I share that judgment. He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08012455000515"></a>&#147;My personal hope is that the UK will decide to maintain a division headquarters beyond 2008 as the Iraqi Government&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000477"></a>and I stress that phrase&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000542"></a>&#147;works to extend its authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000478"></a>Unlike the previous speaker, I do not believe that this is the end game. We have made grievous errors and we cannot walk away from them. We have to try our best to reverse the effects. There is no doubt that outside military assistance is no longer the primary mechanism for stabilising Iraq. But it is too soon for the UK to pull out all its forces. I am not aware of all the arguments, but I would be very cautious, now that we have come down to a small number of troops, about going to the next stage and pulling out completely.</p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08012455000152"></a>I come to the real question of the debate, which is whether there should be an inquiry. I argued for one on 29 June 2006 and again in the debate on 22 February 2007, and I argue for it today. The issue will not go away. Just look at today&#146;s newspapers. The <I>Times</I> has the headline, &#147;Publish the secret document on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, ministers are told&#148;. They are told it by the Information Tribunal, which says:</p>

He has just written a book, <I>Defeat: Why They Lost Iraq</I>. He concludes in an article in today&#146;s paper:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08012455000517"></a>&#147;My interviews with diplomats produced no evidence that accurate analysis even reached the foreign secretary&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000481"></a>I do not know whether that is true, but we need to know. We know the analysis that was made in 1991 about whether to go to Baghdad. All of us who supported that war&#151;I take my share of the responsibility&#151;knew full well that there would be serious problems with the stability of Iraq if, as I believed was necessary, one toppled Saddam Hussein. </p>

<a name="80124-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08012455000153"></a>One lesson has surely already been learnt. The surge has been successful. The head of the US army, who warned the United States in, I think, January 2003 that it would need 200,000 troops in Iraq, has been proven right. If we had increased the number of troops earlier, things might have been very different. When John Sawers, the British ambassador in Egypt, who had previously worked in No. 10, went into Iraq, he made a report, which we have seen. We know that he recommended&#151;he was supported in this by Major General Albert Whitley, the most senior British officer with the US land forces&#151;that because of the chaos that he found in Baghdad at the time serious consideration should be given in Downing Street and Whitehall generally to sending the British 16 Air Assault Brigade, which was in Iraq but due to return home, to Baghdad. There is little doubt that, if the British Prime Minister had followed John Sawers&#146;s advice, the American Administration would not have been allowed to &#147;off-ramp&#148; the 16,000 soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division. This was the chance for Britain to make an individual decision. A serious report from a well balanced and knowledgeable diplomat recommended increasing the number of troops in Iraq to deal with the looting and the chaos, but it was overridden. This is not just about the politicians. We have to face the fact that senior diplomats in the Foreign Office have to be held to account, as do the senior generals and other senior members of the Armed Forces. We cannot just go on ignoring what they have done.</p>

In contradiction to the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, whom I greatly respect, I believe that the Falklands commission did have value. The Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence learnt some important lessons, as did the politicians.</p>

I tried in a recent book, the <I>Hubris</I><I></I><I>Syndrome</I>, to draw attention to some of these things, but I am really a participant.

I also agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said. My noble friend Lord Fowler and I go back a long way: we first met as young officers in the Essex Regiment at the time of Suez. On the merits of that escapade, he was right and I was wrong. He was quickly proved to be right. That was more than 50 years ago. It was a great disaster. It is fair to say that what has happened in Iraq is the biggest disaster that has occurred to British foreign and strategic policy since that time. It is of the first importance and of great significance and we must learn lessons from it.</p>

If there is no inquiry, more and more information will leak out and more are more will be known, but in a disordered fashion and in a manner from which it is difficult to draw conclusions. Nor will I speak about the war itself. That was short, sharp and successful. I want to address myself to what has happened post war&#151;what has happened since President Bush stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier in front of a sign proclaiming &#147;mission accomplished&#148;. If only it had been: if only all that has happened since that hubristic and theatrical act could have been avoided.</p>

We specifically need answers to the following questions. First, to what extent did Her Majesty's Government share in the decision making? What was Her Majesty's Government&#146;s input into the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_350"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy that has been followed since the end of the fighting? Secondly, to what extent were Her Majesty's Government overruled by our great ally, the United States, and to what extent was the advice of Her Majesty's Government simply ignored? Thirdly, to what extent did Her Majesty's Government simply leave it all to the Americans as the senior partner in the adventure&#151;let them take the big decisions and confine our actions to our own limited area of responsibility?</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08012455000160"></a>I suspect that there will not be any such inquiry because the findings would be too humiliating for the Government. I suspect, too, that to a very large degree we simply left it to the Americans. I hope that the Minister can assure me that I am wrong and that however badly the situation turned out, Her Majesty&#146;s Government fully participated in all the big decisions. Meanwhile, I draw two preliminary conclusions from what has happened, on which I hope he may feel able to comment.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08012455000161"></a>First, whenever British troops are committed we must be sure to have an adequate say in all strategic and political decisions before, during and after the fighting. If that is not possible in a particular operation because of the imbalance of power between the United States and ourselves, we should stay out. Secondly, the corollary of involving Parliament in decisions to commit troops&#151;I applaud the change introduced by the Prime Minister soon after he took office&#151;is that the Government should be held accountable to Parliament for the outcome, not only for the military operation and how we got into that but for the occupation, the reconstruction, and the fulfilment&#151;or not, as the case may be&#151;of our war aims.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08012455000162"></a>As we all know, the Suez debacle led the British Government to decide not only always to stick as closely as possible to the United States but never again to embark on a military operation that the United States could thwart. But that did not mean having to follow the United States wherever it led. Here I think the Labour Government could take a look at their predecessor, Harold Wilson&#151;I know that he is not a popular man in Labour circles&#151;who showed that it is perfectly possible to remain on very close and good terms with the United States, but he did not follow it into Vietnam, although President Johnson put a great deal of pressure on him to do so, and although other American allies, notably the Australians, did indeed follow the United States down that path.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08012455000163"></a>Therefore, it is not just a question of whether we agree with what the United States wants to do in a given situation, nor is it a question of not wanting to leave the United States isolated in a particular situation, although I can understand the previous Prime Minister&#146;s concerns on that point.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08012455000164"></a>It must also be a question of whether and to what extent a British Government can have an influence on the formation and conduct of policy when British troops are involved. We may have been the junior partner in Iraq but we were and are a partner and therefore we are responsible for what happened in Iraq. We share the responsibility with the United States and others for what happened in Iraq and we

The final lesson I draw from it is that, as a result of the decisions taken by this Government, we find ourselves in a position where we have responsibility without power, where we share in the responsibility for what happened but were not able to influence the big strategic decisions, and that is a very humiliating position for this country to be in.</p>

First, I shall deal with the question of an inquiry. We debated this at great length last February in a debate on Iraq tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hurd. Then, as now, I completely agreed with the Government&#146;s position stated in that debate, when the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08012455000519"></a>&#147;The Prime Minister said yesterday that there were important lessons to learn but that an inquiry was not appropriate while our troops are engaged in combat in Iraq and facing extreme danger&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000482"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, reminded us, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000544"></a>&#147;nobody has set their mind against an inquiry or some form of debate and discussion of these fundamental policy issues in the long term&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000483"></a>As I understand it, that is still the position and I certainly go along with it.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08012455000166"></a>The Minister on that occasion also said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08012455000520"></a>&#147;Now is not the time for investigating what might or might not have been, but for putting our energy&#151;all of our energy&#151;into helping the Iraqi Government bring an end to the violence&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/2/07; col. 1255.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000484"></a>I agree completely with all of that, and I do not consider that discussion of an inquiry is either sensible or appropriate while there are British forces in theatre.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08012455000167"></a>When looking at Iraq, it is important not to start only at 2003. As I have often told the House, I spent the last 12 months of my government service&#151;which ended in August 1991&#151;wholly immersed in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08012455000168"></a>There are two very important lessons to be learnt from 1991. First, do not leave decisions about crucial ceasefire timing and conditions to soldiers, even those as distinguished as Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf; because they got it wrong. Secondly, do not allow a very long, detailed Chapter 7 resolution&#151;that chapter enables you to take military action&#151;such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 of April 1991, to lie for some 12 years before taking decisive military action to enforce it.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08012455000169"></a>Time does not allow expansion on these two lessons, which are part of the reason I consider&#151;and have always considered&#151;our military action in 2003 politically, morally and legally completely justified. Whether one agrees with me about that or not, no one can be satisfied with the way in which things developed after the successful 2003 military action; and, indeed, lessons can and should be learnt.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08012455000170"></a>One mistake which was made was not the commonly levelled criticism that there was no post-military action planning, but that the very detailed planning in the US State Department for handling the civil situation after the invasion and overthrow of Saddam&#151;all of which was meticulously reported in Bob Woodward&#146;s excellent book, <I>Plan of Attack</I>&#151;was never put into action. The State Department was prevented by the Pentagon from implementing it, as my noble friend Lord Anderson said. We have all expressed disquiet in this House about some of the decisions taken after the invasion. An outstanding example was the disbandment of the Iraqi army. As is reported in another Bob Woodward book, <I>State of Denial</I>, General Jay Garner told Donald Rumsfeld that three terrible mistakes had been made. The said that they were,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000545"></a>&#147;the extent of de Ba&#146;athification, getting rid of the army and summarily dumping the Iraq Leadership, Group. Disbanding the military was the biggest mistake&#151;hundreds of thousands of disorganised, armed, unemployed Iraqis running around. It will take years to rebuild the army. They&#146;d taken 30,000 to 40,000 Ba&#146;athists and sent them underground and they&#146;d gotten rid of the Iraq Leadership Group&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000485"></a>It was not for want of some of the people on the ground seeing the dire consequences of some of the mistakes that had been made. These are certainly lessons that need to be learnt.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08012455000171"></a>Not enough recognition was given to how the horrors of Saddam&#146;s regime brutalised and exacerbated tensions between Sunni, Shia and Kurd, fracturing Iraqi society. We know, from the Balkans and elsewhere, the violence that erupts from the removal of a dictatorial regime, and Iraq had been held in the grip of a fearsomely efficient terror machine of incredible brutality. Again, this was recognised by Jay Garner, who at a press conference at the time said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08012455000521"></a>&#147;There&#146;s always problems when you&#146;ve been brutalised for 30 years and you take people out of absolute darkness and put them in sunshine&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08012455000172"></a>I argued in April 2003 that it was a mistake not to tackle Moqtada Sadr then, when he was clearly responsible for the murder in Najaf of the respected 42 year-old Shia cleric leader, al-Khoei, who had just returned to Iraq from exile in London after the invasion. To have dealt with Moqtada then could have avoided many subsequent problems.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08012455000173"></a>We should all learn from the success of General Petraeus&#146;s tactics of the surge, which is leading to a return, however modest, of some of the 2 million Iraqis who fled abroad and to attempts of some Mahdi army militants to bring back some displaced Sunni neighbours to Shia districts. A major aim of the surge was to give Iraqi politicians breathing space to pass legislation to try to bring about some reconciliation. Now, at last, a law has been passed&#151;the Accountability and Justice Act&#151;to give former, not top-level, Ba&#146;ath members some chance of pensions or even reinstatement in their former jobs. Other positive developments are the Sunni Awakening movement, which is acting against the insurgents linked to al-Qaeda, and the main Sunni alliance in the Parliament, the Iraqi Accord Front, indicating that it will rejoin the Maliki Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08012455000174"></a>Control of the oil industry and provincial elections remain elements in the national reconciliation package, but in both there are interesting and encouraging developments, which unfortunately there is no time to

There are some grounds for at least a glimmer of hope for national reconciliation, which everyone&#151;Iraqis and others&#151;has learnt is the only hope for any peaceful progress for Iraq.</p>

The timing is excellent, for the recent gains in security in the region and Iraq&#146;s gains in political stability and cohesion achieved in recent months give a unique opportunity to the European Union and its member states to forge the closer permanent relationship that is our policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08012455000176"></a>There are now most important new opportunities for trade and investment that others are taking on. I spoke in October at the Al Thiqa economic development conference held in Nasiriyah. This was the first ever development conference held in southern Iraq. It was impressive to hear the Ministers for oil, security, housing, roads, water and the Marshes, among others, set out their current expenditure and roll out future plans. The Deputy President, the Deputy Prime Minister and the local governor also spoke. Council members, tribal leaders, other local notables and Members of Parliament took part in the debate.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08012455000177"></a>Some of Iraq&#146;s major new investors were present at the conference, including Japan, the principal investor in the south. Another example of successful investors is MTC Al-Atheer, the Kuwait-registered group working with Iraqi partners, which to date has made $2.5 billion worth of investment in Iraq&#146;s mobile telephone network. I learnt too that the French company Lavage had just signed an agreement with the Iraqi Government for three major cement factories to be refurbished, sharing production 40 per cent to the Iraqi Government and 60 per cent Lavage. The possibilities for EU investors now throughout Iraq, not just in northern Kurdistan, are very large indeed. I look to Her Majesty&#146;s Government and to member states to do all that is possible to encourage EU companies to take up the opportunities. Other nations are doing so and we are being left behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08012455000178"></a>We in the European Union have high competence in building a public administration. Prime Minister Maliki and his Ministers are indeed hard-working and the Parliament is fully functioning. But to be effective, Ministers must be supported by a functioning and competent administration that is committed to serving the people. In Iraq, at all levels of the administration, there is a profound lack in skills in this most important area, but we can help. This crucial gap gives the European Union a chance to show our special skills in capacity and institution building as well as in training. Of course, creating a public service ethos in Iraq will require a complete reversal of the former position which the previous administration took. As we in the European Union know well from our work in central and eastern Europe throughout the enlargement process, dictatorship thrives on public control and turns away from serving the public interest.</p>

I hope that Prime Minister Maliki will visit the European Union soon. If he does, I would like us to be able to present him with the package of training and institution and capacity building in public health and education that Iraq so sorely needs. Public health is a key, essential element in stabilisation and association processes. Access to public health is a millennium development goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08012455000180"></a>In October I had the opportunity, and again two weeks ago, to address the Iraqi Parliament in plenary session&#151;not once but twice. I was their first official visitor and it was a great honour to address them. I learnt immediately how much assistance they need. We in the European Parliament, in consequence, are setting up a permanent ad hoc delegation to Iraq. We have a new rapporteur for an Iraq report&#151;a close friend of mine, the socialist Portuguese Member of the European Parliament, Ana Gomes&#151;and I am her shadow for the next report. We believe that strengthening Parliament&#146;s ties is one of the key ways in which we can assist the democratic process.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08012455000181"></a>Iraq has a permanent standing constitution committee, because there are still problems in the constitution. We can assist. Women&#146;s issues are a key area in today&#146;s Iraq. My colleague Ana Gomes is on the women&#146;s committee in the European Parliament. We at once vowed that we would create those ties officially as well as informally. Then there are the issues of how to frame and progress laws and the essential links that are still missing between Ministers and their civil servants in drafting laws and for Parliament in progressing them. Proper parliamentary procedures are still not in place. Those needs are vital and we can help.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08012455000182"></a>Iraq has a true parliament and a wholly secular constitution. It is one of the very few nations in the region to have such a constitution, despite its flaws. We should do all that we can to help the Iraqis to strengthen the democratic process. The rule of law is critical to a functioning democracy. I pay tribute to the Council of Ministers and the EUJUST LEX exercise which has trained so many judges and magistrates. I am proud that, through this mechanism, we have trained 24,000 election monitors, who I saw working so hard in the 2005 elections in January and December of that year.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08012455000183"></a>However, there must be cohesion in the European Union institutional approach if we are to succeed. There must be closer co-ordination also between member states. It is now possible, at last, to have a unified EU approach. Past national divisions have healed and the way ahead is clear. It will require careful, dedicated and patient work to deliver what we have promised to the Iraqi people. Like us, the people of Iraq demand democracy and good governance. They demand and need the provision of basic rights, basic services and the full complement of those enjoyments of privileges that we have in our democracies in western Europe. We have come a long way towards delivering that goal, and with the EU newly united on the issue of Iraq, I believe that we can achieve much more in partnership and co-operation with the Government, the parliament, the administration and the people of Iraq.</p>

The lessons to be drawn from the recent history of Iraq are of profound importance, not just to Iraq, but to ourselves and others. I believe it to be a counsel of despair to say that the only thing to be learnt from history is that no one has ever learnt anything from history. Nor am I impressed by the canard that it is easy to be wise after the event. It is surely better to be wise after the event than to be unwise or to pass by on the other side. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said in his eloquent speech, this matter is not going to go away. I join my noble friend in paying tribute to the gallantry of British service men and women and those of other nations who have served in Iraq, together with the many foreign civilians who have served there, and in expressing sympathy for the sufferings of the Iraqi people.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08012455000187"></a>Despite the reductions in violence following the troop surge, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, referred, the situation is very grave. As has been mentioned, the number of people driven from their homes has apparently quadrupled to more than 2 million. Since the occupation began, more than 2 million people have fled the country, although some are trickling back, largely because of visa problems. Electricity in Baghdad is available for only eight hours a day&#151;half the level before the invasion. Unemployment is more than 60 per cent. More than 40 per cent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. Focus group surveys carried out for General Petraeus in five Iraqi cities recently are reported to have found that all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the US invasion is the primary cause of violence in the country and regard the withdrawal of all occupying forces as the key to national reconciliation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08012455000188"></a>Next Thursday, your Lordships will hold a debate to be introduced by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, on the Government&#146;s consultation document on war powers and treaties. I venture to guess that Parliament will in future be more sympathetic to any government call for support in overseas deployment of troops if there has been complete candour and openness about Iraq. So I add my voice to those who say that it is timely that, in accordance with longstanding tradition, an independent inquiry should be set up as soon as is practicable, not in any sense to seek scapegoats but in order to learn lessons for the future while those who have been involved in the recent history of Iraq are  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_356"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>still around and memories are fresh. I do not accept the argument that this cannot happen when troops are still in theatre. Their morale would be unaffected and they will do their duty, as they have on previous occasions. They could be there for a long time&#151;our people are still in the Falklands.</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08012455000189"></a>A large number of interrelated questions remain to be answered. Were the wholly inadequate plans for the stabilisation and reconstruction effort after the April 2003 invasion the result of avoidable ignorance or divided counsels within the American Administration and the British Government? Was the lack of a UN mandate a fatal weakness in securing necessary resources and expertise? No one will know the answer to that better than the Minister. Was the decision to adopt a model of direct governance a hindrance to the chances of addressing the issues of transition and reform? Was the widespread criminality, the international terrorism and the massive insurgency, which has bedevilled reconstruction efforts, predicted? If not, could it have been? Could greater initial force have averted the murderous chaos?</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08012455000190"></a>Why was there an assumption that the coalition would quickly be able to transfer civil governance to Iraqis when it was clear that the process of de-Ba&#146;athification, the purge of the top layer of the Civil Service and removal of its institutional memory, and the disbanding of the Iraqi army&#151;in fact the destruction of all Iraqi institutions&#151;would leave a vacuum making political development, internal security and reconstruction infinitely more difficult? What was the basis for the belief that the Iraqis would welcome foreign occupation? How long did the Government believe at the time of the invasion, and indeed now, that the international forces&#151;themselves a cause of and target for insurgency activity&#151;would be required to prevent a descent into anarchy and civil war?</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08012455000191"></a>There has been a disjuncture between political discussion and the realities on the ground in Iraq. In the limited time when foreign occupation is tolerable to the great majority of Iraqis, if it still is, and if security and the rule of law, political progress and reconstruction are to be achieved, can the Government assure us that the massive cuts in senior personnel at the Foreign Office&#151;one in four&#151;have not and will not affect its future capability to deliver what was once regarded as the finest advice on middle eastern affairs available to any government in the world, delivered by men and women trusted and respected as no other in the region?</p>

<a name="80124-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08012455000192"></a>These are urgent questions that can be answered only by a full, independent inquiry. I hope that the Government will not continue to shelter behind the principle of the unripe time. Parliament will not tolerate that, and I believe that the Government have less to fear from openness than the reverse.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08012455000194"></a>If we could summarise the political military analysis&#151;for example, that given by Mr Wilkinson at Chatham House last October&#151;we would stress that governments must learn that when you intervene in someone else&#146;s country, for whatever reason, you have to allow that some of the consequences will entail nation building. If you intervene in someone else&#146;s country you must have and act on a political and economic reconstruction plan that delivers improvement to the quality of life or face the consequences or the prospect of nurturing insurgents. Having intervened in someone else&#146;s country, in any post-conflict environment, the essential priorities must be to establish security, the rule of law and to deliver access to justice, if I may echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08012455000195"></a>It is fairly easy to list the lessons to be drawn and noble Lords who have spoken have given us a very good insight into the key questions that we should address. I do not wish to repeat them, but they include the question of whether there was too great a rush to war in 2003. Were enough forces deployed? Were they properly resourced and prepared? Did the overwhelming desire to find weapons of mass destruction cause stockpiles of conventional weapons and lead them to be disregarded, but which later armed the insurgency? Should the Iraqi army have been disabled? Was the comprehensive de-Ba&#146;athification process really necessary? There are more than enough questions to put a case for a further and deep inquiry into the intervention in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08012455000196"></a>Written evidence submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee in another place by organisations such as the Council for Arab-British Understanding, among others, bring home the outcome of failures to follow the simple lessons of pre-emptive military intervention. Iraq went almost overnight from a heavily government-controlled state, headed by a despot, to anarchy with no state control. With the state effectively dismantled Iraqis turned to their own tribal and sectarian groupings for security and support. Sectarian divisions were aggravated and deteriorated. Iraq&#146;s future potential has also been undermined. Brutal, targeted attacks on academics, journalists and doctors have added to and accelerated a huge brain drain that dates from the sanctions era. It will take a lengthy period of calm, safety and security to attract this key talent back in sufficient numbers to give Iraq a viable future.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08012455000197"></a>Perhaps the most sombre lesson to be drawn is the degree to which the population of the region has been destabilised. According to the UNHCR, Iraq&#146;s displaced are the world&#146;s largest group of urban refugees and the largest refugee crisis in the Middle East since 1948. The UNHCR estimates that there are 2.2 million IDPs in Iraq and that a further 2 million have fled from Iraq&#151;mainly to Syria and Jordan&#151;whose health, education and social support systems have buckled under the strain.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08012455000198"></a>Syria&#146;s 1.4 million Iraqi refugees are increasingly running out of resources, with a third now on the verge of destitution. Poverty is making inroads into the refugee population&#146;s health, with a fifth of the chronically ill unable to purchase medication. Tens of thousands of Iraqis will need food support over the coming months, with more than 250,000 expected to need food assistance by the end of the year.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_358"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08012455000199"></a>In Syria alone, some 100 new cases of refugees living in extreme poverty are identified every week. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Nearly half the families report that their children have dropped out of school, with one in 10 working to help support their families. Overall, the number of Iraqis uprooted by sectarian violence and human rights abuses is surpassed globally only by the 6.4 million Sudanese internally displaced persons and refugees. That is something that your Lordships might reflect on when recognising that by far the greater part of the Iraqi refugee crisis results from the US/UK-led intervention.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08012455000200"></a>The Minister will be aware that such is the enormity of Iraq&#146;s displacement crisis that this year the UNHCR needs to raise more than &#163;130 million for its Middle East region operations&#151;its largest single relief operation. Targets have been set that include doubling to 200,000 the number of Iraqi refugee children attending school; supporting 15,000 families who decide to return home; and assisting 400,000 displaced persons living in insecure and dangerous conditions.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08012455000201"></a>Those programmes deliver shelter, healthcare, education, general support and food to uprooted Iraqis throughout the region. They are at risk unless the UNHCR appeal is met with strong support, which sadly has not been forthcoming from the UK Government. Given the Minister&#146;s experience in the UN, he is uniquely placed to explain why our Government do not support the UNHCR targeting of immediate relief programmes at refugees in and outside Iraq. What basis is there for considering that UK investment in reconstruction and infrastructure, aimed at rebuilding the basic services in the longer term, can be a substitute for the immediate support urgently needed by hundreds of thousands of refugee victims of a war that we helped to initiate?</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08012455000202"></a>Finally, further to an Answer given to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on 21 January, to which the noble Lord referred again today, on the resettlement of Iraqis at risk under the Gateway Protection Programme, the Minister will be aware that its success is dependent on a sufficient number of local authorities participating. There is considerable concern that this is not the case at present. Will he advise what steps the Government are taking to ensure that local authorities will come forward?</p>

As I understand it, the noble Lord has argued that, as a supporter of the war originally, he is convinced that too many questions remain unanswered about the way in which the decision to go into the conflict was taken and about what will happen in relation to planning for post-conflict Iraq. He argues that the time is right for an inquiry because we need to learn lessons.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08012455000204"></a>Some lessons are already very clear and we could think about how to act upon them now. We need clearer, and more generally acknowledged principles  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_359"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about when it is right and legal to take military action that entails going into another country. I believed at the time&#151;and believe now&#151;that our action was legal; others honestly disagreed.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08012455000205"></a>However, in the course of my time as a Minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the criteria for taking military action in other countries changed, most noticeably in relation to Kosovo, where we introduced the idea of overwhelming humanitarian disaster being a sufficient cause to take military action in another country. The rules by which the UN operates do need to be looked at dispassionately and a real effort made to get better international consensus.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08012455000206"></a>There is another clear lesson about intelligence. Raw intelligence is not available either to the public or to Ministers, and should not be because, all, or most, intelligence reports are drawn from a wide variety of different sources, all are subject to judgment and open to different degrees of interpretation. To attempt to publish as much as the Government did, in the form that we did, raised more and more questions. It was done from the very best of motives.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08012455000207"></a>However, we need to think about how we deal with that sort of intelligence in the future. How much should go into the public domain? How should that be presented and when? We need to take those decisions calmly and clearly&#151;not in the heat of a huge argument about who was right and wrong and who knew what when. That is something that we could be considering now. Therefore, those are two lessons that are clear already.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08012455000208"></a>On the question of an inquiry, let me say that, speaking as someone who was a Foreign Office Minister at the time, I would welcome one&#151;but only when conditions in Iraq make that possible and right. </p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08012455000209"></a>I now turn to &#147;the position in Iraq&#148;, as the title of the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, asks us to do. I want to concentrate on two areas&#151;security and economic development. On security, everyone acknowledges, even after yesterday&#146;s bombing attacks, that there are many fewer incidents now than there were this time last year. The surge has been a real factor, certainly in security around Baghdad. I think that every commentator acknowledges that there has been a reduction in the level of day-to-day violence around Baghdad.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08012455000210"></a>Engagement with the Sunni tribal leaders has led to real improvements. There are local citizens groups among the Sunni community. A decision to take real consultation initiatives with the Sunni tribesmen about the al-Qaeda threat has been successful. Areas that were virtually bandit country and the heartlands of al-Qaeda in Iraq, where only the US marines were able to operate last year, are becoming safer. Obviously, that is around Al-Aubar and Sala Hadeen. All commentators are noting changes in turnaround; from what I have heard from our observers on the ground, it has been dramatic and significant. That has meant that there has been a reduction in violence of about 60 to 70 per cent. We are back to the levels that pertained at the end of 2003&#151;too high, but going down. Intra-Shia fighting&#151;that is, fighting between Shia groups&#151;has diminished. A ceasefire that was

Last week, the attempts of Shia extremists failed to spark off a resumption of Shia violence.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08012455000211"></a>The capability of the Iraqi security forces has also improved. Last night, they saw off the violence in Basra with only air cover from the British forces, but they took on everything that happened on the ground. Will it last? It has been acknowledged&#151;by even the most critical parts of the media, albeit grudgingly&#151;that there have been real improvements. The next few weeks will give us further indications.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08012455000212"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, spoke with great authority on the economy. There are a few facts that we need to bear in mind. The Iraqi economy is growing&#151;by 6 per cent last year. That is in striking distance of a number of neighbouring Arab economies. Inflation is down from 60 per cent in 2006 to 16 per cent&#151;the calculation of the now independent Central Bank of Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08012455000213"></a>Employment was, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, said, running at about 60 per cent in 2006, but it was down to 19 per cent at the end of last year. These are important figures. The Iraqis are benefiting from the increase in oil prices. They are not squandering the money. It is being invested in physical and human infrastructure&#151;in health and education.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08012455000214"></a>Around Basra, we have seen the Iraqi-run and Iraqi-based Basra Inward Investment Agency, the Basra Development Fund&#151;with start-up money for small and medium sized businesses&#151;and the Basra Development Commission. All of these are important economic indicators and have led to a 54 per cent increase in British exports to Iraq in areas that are also important indicators of economic growth, such as industrial machinery and road vehicles.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08012455000215"></a>Our trade associations are starting to go back into Iraq. The Middle East Association and British Expertise took trade missions towards the end of last year. The MEA is planning more this year. UK companies are active in electronic banking, medicine, wider healthcare and construction, including developing the Umm Qasr Port.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08012455000216"></a>Another lesson is that judgments in these areas are still evolving. Finding sources of information that widen our perspective is enormously important. It is disappointing that, when Iraqi politicians come to this country and talk to us in Parliament, sometimes few active politicians turn up to hear them.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08012455000217"></a>One last lesson I have learnt is that British foreign policy dictates our defence policy. We are never in any doubt that defence policy is dependent on and subordinate to wider foreign policy priorities. It is important to know how our allies will operate. It is disconcerting to find our close allies operating on the basis that defence policy leads foreign policy. However, the fact that Pentagon was in the lead, not only on operational prosecution of the fighting&#151;which was right and proper&#151;but also on post-conflict handling in Iraq, was in stark contrast to our own position. Speaking as someone who was a Minister at the time, that was a very difficult realisation. It was another hard and painful lesson and one from which I hope that we have all learnt.</p>

I am struck by the efforts that have been made in the United States&#146; approach to address issues of gravity for our country in a bipartisan manner. That is extremely important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08012455000219"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, is right to draw attention to some of the improvements that certainly seem to exist in Iraq at the moment. There seems to be a calmer atmosphere. One must guard against the fact that we tend to measure the situation in Iraq in terms of British casualties. The move to Basra airport has changed that situation but I understand that the number of attacks in Basra city&#151;and of a particularly vicious and nasty kind&#151;are continuing at the same level, but the targets are now different. Certainly, there is some optimism, expressed by the IMF and Ambassador Crocker. But the improvements have been achieved in some unusual ways. The Americans are now paying the militias $300 a month and providing them with arms, and we have currently sub-contracted significant areas of security in Iraq, in both Basra and Baghdad. There is a question about whether that will hold. There has been a welcome improvement in the Sunni expulsion of al-Qaeda from certain areas, suggesting, however, that once they get their own areas in order they will look to reassert their authority in some of the mixed areas. The threats of more ethnic cleansing are certainly worrying.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08012455000220"></a>The worrying reports coming out of Basra suggest that we have settled for a balance of power between different militias. There have been significant illustrations in the form of attacks on women, with criticisms of their dress leading to physical assault, if not actual murder and execution. They suggest that we are presiding at a distance over a new Shia Taliban town being created. That gives some real concern to Kuwait and other neighbours about what may be developing there.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08012455000221"></a>I certainly agree with the comment that the next six months are critical. Will the central government establish their authority? Will the Iraqi army really get a grip and be able to assert itself? Will it be able to sort out the police, get them working and the corrupt elements out? There are worrying reports about some of the problems in training the police. Can we see some real improvement and progress in reconstruction?</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08012455000222"></a>There are real concerns about the tensions and criticisms emerging between the Army and DfID. The feeling among many in the Army is that DfID has failed to take advantage of the work that the Army has had to do. A question to come out of this is whether we need some form of hardened DfID operational capability that can get into a less than ideal security situation and start reconstruction so that people on the ground can see the immediate benefit of a successful military operation.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08012455000223"></a>I was struck by the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons. I am not sure where she is on the inquiry; I think she said that she favoured one. She went on to cite various lessons that could be learnt  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_362"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>straight away, and I offer a few ideas for lessons that could be learnt. With the greatest respect to the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, we cannot just depend on Bob Woodward&#146;s book and what Jay Garner said to the president. These are all bits of evidence which need bringing together. It is important that we address this at an early stage.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08012455000224"></a>To analyse what happened in our relationship with the United States, I look back at my personal involvement in the first Gulf War and the relationship then. There were different personalities. There was no doubt that Douglas Hurd and Jim Baker had a particularly good relationship, and in no sense did the Pentagon dominate the State Department. Dick Cheney was a more junior member of the Administration&#151;an effective Defense Secretary, my opposite number&#151;but the State Department was not by-passed. Our co-operation was close, with one exception: the decision to stop after the turkey shoot and the Mutla Ridge; some may remember those terrible pictures of the Iraqi army trying to escape out of Kuwait. The meeting at which the decision to stop was taken was held in the White House without any British representation. Until that point, co-operation had been close throughout. We played a major part in ensuring that we had the right rules of engagement before it started. Looking at what happened in the United States at this time, we had&#151;in Washington&#151;a very inexperienced president with an exceptionally powerful vice-president who drew on his own experiences of the first Gulf War and his close relationship with another great Washington hand, Donald Rumsfeld. They undoubtedly very much sidelined Colin Powell and the State Department. We want to learn lessons on that.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08012455000225"></a>We also want to learn lessons on intelligence. I do not think that it is unkind to say this as it is widely known: I chaired the Intelligence Security Committee, and we were critical of the lack of interest that the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, took in intelligence. We regularly encouraged him in successive reports to chair the ministerial Committee on Intelligence Services on a regular basis. It did not happen. He must bitterly regret that now. A closer involvement in intelligence of that kind would have helped him as a very inexperienced Prime Minister&#151;that is no criticism; it was the inevitable consequence of 18 years of Conservative government. He came in with no ministerial experience at all. However, closer involvement would have helped him to know which questions to ask and which challenges to put to the intelligence services. He had our reports&#151;although I always worried whether he really read them. We had already said on more that one occasion&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, knows very well&#151;what a hard target Iraq was for human intelligence. The intelligence services told us, as was in our reports, that we knew very little about what was going on in Iraq. That should have been a red light to warn a Prime Minister that he had better ask some pretty tough questions before taking some fundamental decisions of that kind.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08012455000226"></a>On the military side, it is interesting to think that when we set out to expel Saddam Hussein and his invading Iraqi army from somebody else&#146;s country, 750,000 troops were involved. When we set out to undertake the much more difficult task of invading  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_363"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>somebody else&#146;s country and destroying their Government and president, we tried to do so with less than half that amount. If one is talking about the effect of &#147;shock and awe&#148;, and&#151;that favourite phrase of the Americans&#151;&#147;having won the battle&#148;, you must hold the ground, which means substantial forces. But you must do something when you are holding the ground. I offer the analogy of the SAS and their stun grenades. If you try to break into premises and chuck in a stun grenade, you do not just then wait for an hour for the dust to settle and people to gather their wits. The point of the stun grenade is that, having made the attack, you get in quick and change things fast. We did not come into Iraq fast with real plans; that was the great mistake.</p>

<a name="80124-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08012455000227"></a>Briefly, on an inquiry, I am critical of our Parliament. Congress is much more effective at holding the Executive to account. Parliament should show its determination and resolve, and insist upon an inquiry. The Iraq Study Group was, in a sense, an American committee of privy counsellors: Jim Baker, Lee Hamilton, Larry Eagleburger and Bill Perry; a range of distinguished American people. We must set up something similar. The clinching argument for that is there will never otherwise be a right time, but we may find ourselves in this situation again. We cannot be sure. I would not like to take responsibility for the deaths of our Armed Forces facing a new situation, if we made some of the same mistakes we have made this time but had not got around to studying them, learning the lessons, and ensuring that we never made those mistakes again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08012455000229"></a>As Rory Stewart has said, nowhere in 30 years has there been such a concentration of foreign money, manpower and determination as in Iraq. Nor has their failure, to some extent, been more dramatic. He adds:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08012455000522"></a>&#147;Our failures were due to incompetence rather than malice, but the population were not prepared to give us the benefit of the doubt. For 80 years the Iraqis have rejected colonialism. They have rejected non-Muslim government for much longer. They are the only people who can rebuild their nation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08012455000230"></a>The lessons HMG should draw from Iraq are all relevant to the continuing military task in Afghanistan: the struggle for resources, whether helicopters, armoured vehicles or, not least, skilled manpower. The Government have remorselessly refused to provide the money to meet the ever-increasing demands they have placed on the Armed Forces ever since the strategic review, coupled with taking on not one but two wars simultaneously, in addition to our continuing commitment in the Balkans. We have moved from being told that not a shot would be fired in Afghanistan to being told that we are committed there for many years in what has proved to be a virtually full-scale war. We are not helped by the fact that it is a NATO operation in which some are fighting but others are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08012455000231"></a>The Defence Committee in the other place has always been deeply concerned at what the Treasury&#146;s resource accounting and budgeting&#151;RAB&#151;procedure

<ul><a name="08012455000546"></a>&#147;use its asset base of &#163;86 billion and bear down on that to release resources&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000486"></a>It did not think that meant cuts, just stretching the budget further. It reported, however, that the Treasury was unwilling,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000547"></a>&#147;for wider reasons, to let the MoD have the flexibility it had sought&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08012455000233"></a>Ever since the Iraq operation began&#151;and before&#151;the MoD has been contending with undermanning, the consequent breaching of harmony lines, a lack of vital equipment that has meant that there is not enough for training on it as it has to go straight to the operational forces on the ground, and permanent overstretch. Families at home are left in disgraceful accommodation, many have suffered from unpardonable stress because of breakdowns to the pay system, and the severely wounded who return to this country have had, in some cases, very shabby treatment. There is no money for training or servicing. The helicopter crash in Iraq some years ago was attributed to insufficient training of the crew. The inquiry into the more recent Nimrod crash in Afghanistan has reported that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08012455000523"></a>&#147;A tautly managed engineering establishment and a recent outflow of skilled personnel led to an effective dilution of engineering skills&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000487"></a>In other words, there is no money for training and skilled engineers are leaving the services, which is one of the vital pinch points identified by the NAO.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08012455000234"></a>The FCO, which ought to be able to produce not only admirable advice but also skilled linguists with in-country skills, has an almost invisible budget. The MoD, which is responsible for the nation&#146;s defence&#151;the chief reason now why we can punch above our weight on the international scene&#151;has been starved of funds for the past 15 to 20 years. We proudly claim that we give more in aid than any other country except one, the US. DfID&#146;s budget is to rise by 11 per cent each year for the next three years. That and the major increases in education and health far outstrip defence. The MoD&#146;s budget will rise by 1.5 per cent per annum for the foreseeable future, and it is looking at a shortfall of &#163;1 billion over the next three years even now. Defence will get only 2 per cent of GDP by 2011, while the defence budgets of the Russians and the Chinese are rocketing up. If the Government use their defence forces as part of their international strategy, they must expect to pay. It is shaming that the Danes can take care of their interpreters in Iraq, but we cannot. It is shaming that at a time when shortage of manpower is a serious problem, the MoD is trying to find ways to make the Ghurkhas, worth their weight in gold in Iraq and Afghanistan, retire early in order to save on their pensions. Iraq should have taught us the value of our Armed Forces as our representatives in the world.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08012455000235"></a>We are all only too familiar with the failure, until quite recently, to provide armoured vehicles and helicopters with lift. One lesson of Iraq must surely be not to leave the forces in Afghanistan in a similar situation, obliged at this stage to rely on the goodwill, on some occasions,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_365"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of other NATO allies on the ground who are quite likely to withdraw or to have another agenda. We should also learn from Iraq not to repeat the gross lack of care for the operational efficiency and the human well-being of our Armed Forces, which is demonstrated by the Government&#146;s readiness to enter into a commitment with no visible end in Afghanistan while our Armed Forces are still not disengaged from Iraq and are seriously undermanned. Without the Territorial Army, we would be in serious trouble. HMG cannot expect the TA to rotate again and again. We are rightly committed to retain the capability to re-intervene in south-eastern Iraq should the situation deteriorate. Shall we have enough men and mat&#233;riel? The Armed Forces have a vital part to play in the defence of this country, and we cannot exclude the possibility of an attack from the sea by al-Qaeda. They are also regularly called upon for domestic emergencies: Operation Fresco, the floods, and so on. The lesson we should draw from Iraq and for Afghanistan is that it is in the national interest to ensure that we have forces trained and equipped to defend us adequately and, where appropriate, to intervene abroad; Serbia looms, and the situation in Pakistan is fragile. No Government should expect to commit their Armed Forces to military operations overseas without first ensuring the long-term funding. Not least, we are destroying a generation of our best young people. Recently, a witness to the Defence Select Committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08012455000524"></a>&#147;I am very worried about ... the problem of mental and physical sustainability of the piece of software that we call the human flesh of our soldiers ... When you have young soldiers, fit, highly motivated from elite units, and they are all pretty good, 40 days under sustained fire, which is longer in the line than most infantry battalions had on the Western Front, you are asking for trouble. You are grinding them down. We are looking at tremendous physical and mental ageing of our soldier population&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08012455000236"></a>For too many people in this country, Iraq is simply the trigger for an anti-US reaction. It should be a wake-up call from the public telling the Government to ensure that the Armed Forces are given the support that they need and deserve. I add, in strong support of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, that the most important lesson must surely be to end for ever the culture of sofa government and to return the proper powers of the Cabinet, the JIC and the ministries, so long ignored in favour of wholly unqualified special advisers. This is where the Treasury ought to be held to account by properly briefed Ministers.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08012455000237"></a>We also need to remember that our influence in the world depends on how both enemies and friends perceive our diplomatic and military power. It is in our power to ensure that they continue to respect us. It is also in the power of the present Government&#151;I fear perhaps of future Governments as well&#151;to be so obsessed by the need to save money that they forget that we have a part to play in the world and that respect is tied up with how we are seen to perform diplomatically and militarily. We cannot do the other things unless we have that respect.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_366"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inquiry has been championed by the Opposition parties and, so far, the Government have given only a dilatory response. I do not intend to dwell on that issue, except to make a plea that if and when such an inquiry is held, it should not simply become an occasion for settling accounts and partisan points scoring. The terms of reference and the membership of such an inquiry would need to be designed to discourage that. Meanwhile, it is surely none too soon to begin to draw some lessons from what has been for all concerned&#151;both protagonists and antagonists of the action taken in Iraq&#151;a tragic and debilitating experience. For that reason, this debate is to be welcomed, and I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for obtaining it. I hope it will be put to good use. I shall concentrate on a somewhat eclectic mixture of some of the political and diplomatic aspects of the subject rather than the military and security ones.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08012455000239"></a>The first is the intelligence and the uses to which it was put in the run-up to the invasion, which has been mentioned by several noble Lords. It seems now to be rather generally recognised that not only was the intelligence on Iraq&#146;s WMD assets flawed but that the public use to which that intelligence was put was unwise and excessively prescriptive. Intelligence gathering, particularly from totalitarian regimes which will go to any lengths to protect their secrets, is not an exact science and it is never going to provide certainty about the assets and intentions of those regimes. It will often provide crucial parts of a jigsaw puzzle, but not the whole of it, and Governments should not believe or assert that it does. Have we learnt the negative and positive aspects of that lesson? I very much doubt it. The reactions to the United States&#146; recent national intelligence estimate on Iran&#146;s nuclear programmes would seem to indicate quite the contrary. The same people who were most critical of the intelligence on Iraq and the uses to which it was put are now speaking of the intelligence on Iran as if it were Holy Writ. Would they be taking the same view if the estimate had indicated that Iran was close to acquiring nuclear weapons? I rather doubt it. Better surely, in the light of experience in Iraq, to be more cautious in analysing the implications of intelligence, whether it suits one&#146;s purpose or not.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08012455000240"></a>The second aspect is the role of the United Nations in the run-up to the war. It is pretty clear now that the campaign to get a second resolution during the first two months of 2003 was doomed to failure, not just because of the possibility of vetoes by France and Russia but because the necessary nine positive votes to get such a resolution were simply not there. I recall at the time, when the campaign for a second resolution began, saying, &#147;They must know something I don&#146;t&#148;. It appears now that they did not. In the event, the campaign for a second resolution and the public confrontations in New York ended up inflicting far more damage on the United Nations and on the legitimacy of the action eventually taken than was the case over Kosovo a few years earlier when a quite different approach was followed. Is that an invitation to bypass the UN and to use force unilaterally? Certainly not, in my view. But it should be an invitation to avoid getting locked into a military timetable that is inconsistent from the outset with any realistic prospect of getting a  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_367"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>second resolution. The logic of getting international inspectors back into Iraq was to give them sufficient time to do their work, and that logic was ignored.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08012455000241"></a>The third aspect is post-war justice. The trials of Saddam Hussein and his principal henchmen and their execution can surely have satisfied no cause other than that of revenge, which should have no place in the administration of justice. Would it not have been far better if they had been brought before an international tribunal, as were those guilty of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and if world opinion had been able to appreciate fully the enormity of the crimes of which they were accused, while seeing that they were given a reasonable opportunity to defend themselves? No method of trial could have entirely avoided the risk of creating martyrs, but the one chosen was absolutely certain to fall into that trap. Now that we have a functioning international criminal court, even if not every country in the world yet accepts it, this must surely become the right and best way to challenge the doctrine of impunity.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08012455000242"></a>Time does not permit me to go into the many bitter lessons to be drawn from the fundamental errors made since the end of the first military phase of the action against Iraq&#151;the provision of inadequate manpower to achieve security in the collapsed state; the disbanding of the Iraqi army; the banning of all Baathists from public service; and the fatal combination of incompetence and hubris which characterised the US handling of Iraq in the first years after the invasion&#151;but the failure to grasp and to come to terms with the regional dimension of Iraq&#146;s problems deserves some mention. It should have been clear from the outset that all Iraq&#146;s neighbours had a vital interest in that country&#146;s future, policies and structure, and that each one of them had the capacity seriously to undermine the prospects for a stable and prosperous Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08012455000243"></a>That ought to have led to an approach which created a dialogue with those neighbours and which built in the dimension of regional security, ideally through the establishment of sub-regional security guarantees and confidence-building measures, to any long-term perspectives for Iraq. Instead, the three crucial neighbours of Iraq&#151;Turkey, Iran and Syria&#151;were handled in ways which either marginalised them or treated them as pariahs with whom even dialogue was not possible. The reversal of that policy has come very late in the day and yet that same regional dimension arises when dealing with any number of the world&#146;s most burning questions&#151;Afghanistan, Burma, Zimbabwe and Darfur, to give a few examples. We ignore that dimension at our peril.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08012455000244"></a>Perhaps the most important lesson to be drawn from Iraq is the complete bankruptcy of the policies which have been given the label in the United States of neo-conservatism, even if some of those who have practised these policies would reject that label. Not only have the policies not worked on the ground but it is now clear that the US people have no stomach to seek to pursue them and impose them on an unwilling world. The turning away from these policies is something which we in this country should welcome since the pursuit of them has damaged us, too,

If neo-conservative policies were to be succeeded by a period of isolationism or of unwillingness by the United States to pull its full weight in handling the many global problems which face us all, then our last state would not be much better than our first.</p>

Of course, proper Conservatives do not have a hyphen in their conservatism. I should like to add my thanks to the many who have thanked my noble friend Lord Fowler for this debate and for his excellent speech in introducing it. He pointed out that it is nearly five years since the invasion of Iraq but it is also almost four years since Ministers from the Dispatch Box were telling us that it was time to move on; the war was over and therefore the debate was over. Sadly, the debate was no more over than the violence was over.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08012455000247"></a>If a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, had produced deaths and injuries on the scale that we have seen in the Iraq war, there would have been an outpouring of sympathy, appeals for money on television, and endless debates in this House. I am somewhat staggered by the equanimity with which questions about the scale of casualties in Iraq have been received. My noble friend Lord Fowler referred to a figure of 100,000 dead since the invasion. There are many other estimates, many of them far higher. Johns Hopkins estimates more than half a million dead and the <I>New England Journal of Medicine </I>estimates between 100,000 to 200,000 dead with a mid point of 150,000. There are many estimates but I would go along with my noble friend that a figure of 100,000 seems about right, judged on the wide range of different estimates there are. The vast majority of deaths have been at the hands of non-western forces but the West has considerable responsibility for the context in which those deaths happened. We need to recognise and acknowledge our role in creating the conditions for violence and instability. It is that reluctance to acknowledge that responsibility that has fuelled so much of the criticism and hatred of western action.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08012455000248"></a>All this stems from a war that was based on a false premise. This was an optional war, a war we did not have to fight. If we had known the costs, both human and financial, surely we would have opted for a policy of continued containment of Saddam Hussein. I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, that that policy had demonstrably failed. No one is entitled to make a mistake of this magnitude. It is no justification for these deaths to say that 100,000 people would

We simply do not know that. The Secretary-General of the UN described this war as an &#147;illegal war&#148;. The Minister speaking for the Government today was working for the Secretary-General at that time. It would be interesting to know what his view was on that pronouncement.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08012455000249"></a>Whether or not the war was illegal, there can be no doubt that the intelligence was handled in a particularly shoddy way. I agree with what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, and the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, about the difficulty and the undesirability of publishing so much intelligence material, but what was astonishing was not the publication just of intelligence material but the publication of some material in support of the Government&#146;s case that was not intelligence at all. I find it utterly bewildering that the Government should have thought it right to publish under the Government&#146;s name a paper that had been written by an academic and publish it without his permission, without his acknowledgement and without his approval. It was like the conduct of a third-rate cheat during a university exam.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08012455000250"></a>This Government, who led us into this war, were the same Government who passed the legislation in this House that set up the International Criminal Court, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, referred. As those who participated in the debates on that legislation will remember, it provides that commanders, including politicians in charge of forces, can be prosecuted for what they did not know but which the court judged they should have known. There are plenty of things that the Government should have known about Iraq. They should have known that there was no firm evidence of WMD. They should have known that there were no significant links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. They should have known that it was nave to think that democracy could take root quickly in a country such as Iraq. They should have known that the intelligence that it takes about 45 minutes to activate certain lethal weapons applied only to battlefield weapons and not to strategic weapons&#151;a question that the Prime Minister never seems to have asked.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08012455000251"></a>On the position in Iraq today, I agree with noble Lords who have pointed out that the surge seems to have brought some improvement in security. It would be churlish not to recognise that and to give praise to General Petraeus, but it is also right to point out that factors other than the extra 30,000 troops have also helped to produce this situation. There is first the ceasefire that Moqtada al-Sadr ordered his militia to implement. There is the ethnic cleansing, which means that fewer Shias and Sunnis are now living side by side in Baghdad. Then, as has been mentioned, there are the deals done in Anbar Province by the United States&#151;the same country that refuses to deal with Hamas on the ground that it is a terrorist organisation but which has at the same time supplied arms and money to Sunni militia and vigilantes, many of whom have the blood of American soldiers and Iraqis on their hands. It has done a deal with them to stop them attacking US troops and to police their own zones. The position is an improvement, but  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_370"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Mr Maliki&#146;s anxiety over this arrangement and his fears that these troops should not be incorporated into the main Iraqi forces show that it may be temporary and that we should not rely too strongly on it.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08012455000252"></a>What are the lessons that we need to learn from this disastrous episode? First, we need to learn that the whole concepts of pre-emption, the promotion of democracy and nation building need to be rethought. Our language in these matters also needs to be rethought. Democracy can be built only slowly in societies where family and tribe are the first loyalties. Secondly, this war has tragically encouraged the growth of al-Qaeda&#146;s threat and influence. It has assisted extremist organisations in recruiting British Muslims even in this country, as was illustrated by the chilling import from Baghdad of the technique of packing petrol and gas canisters into cars. Thirdly, the phrase &#147;the war on terror&#148; should be completely banned. Greater emphasis should be placed on the police, intelligence and diplomatic efforts. We are facing not an ideological threat to our way of life or a global insurgency but criminal threats from a lot of different disparate groups, many of them opportunistic groups who attach themselves to nationalistic movements, as al-Qaeda has done with the Sunni resistance movement in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08012455000253"></a>Lastly, we need to recognise that military occupations nearly always end up being unpopular. Opinion polls show that the occupation is strongly opposed by a majority of Iraqi citizens. A recent poll showed that 70 per cent of Iraqi forces want US forces to leave the country immediately. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, made a powerful case for not making a precipitous withdrawal, but the risks of a prolonged, large-scale occupation outweigh those of a gradual withdrawal of the sort that is being advocated by some of the candidates in the US presidential election. It is in our interests that the Iraqis should assume responsibility for their own destiny, and in that way make the accommodation that is necessary for political stability.</p>

I proposed the Motion in another place that brought 130 of my Labour colleagues into the Division Lobby against our own Government. I took no pleasure in doing that, and there are no prizes in politics for having been right at the time&#151;nor would I wish to seek any&#151;but I must observe that that decision to join in the American invasion of Iraq was the single most catastrophic foreign-policy decision taken by the UK in the past 20 or 30 years.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08012455000256"></a>As a result of that invasion, thousands of people, many of whom are our own troops and many are Iraqis, are dead or injured. There are even higher numbers of refugees. Iraq has been in chaos for at least three and a half years. It is in less chaos now, but still the sustainability of society in Iraq is very much in question. Perhaps most crucially of all, the struggle against terrorism worldwide has undoubtedly been set back and hampered by the decisions that were taken then. We need to ask ourselves with care and seriousness how we came to make these mistakes and how they can be avoided in future. Here, for what it is worth, is my list.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08012455000257"></a>First, we should not give open-ended commitments to allies, however important, and particularly to Presidents of the United States, long before military action is taken. We should always remember that the role of a candid friend is sometimes to tell an ally that we believe it is wrong. The United States has given huge sacrifice and service to the rest of the world in the past 100 years, but it is not always right. Sometimes, as an ally and a friend&#151;as one of its most important friends in the world&#151;we need to tell it that we believe that it is wrong.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08012455000258"></a>Secondly, we should not seek to fit the facts around the story that we have already decided to tell. It appears that there were times in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq that that was precisely what was happening.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08012455000259"></a>Thirdly, we should work exhaustively through international organisations and especially through the United Nations. It is an imperfect instrument of course, and always will be, but in working for change around the world we need to use the instruments that we have because if we do not seek to use them, and indeed do not seek to improve them, the resulting actions can bring much greater chaos. Yes, we need to think seriously about how the United Nations is composed, how it works, how it takes its decisions and how those things can be improved. The very important point made by my noble friend Lady Symons is that the international community needs seriously to think through the criteria for intervening in the affairs of a sovereign country, and the United Nations is absolutely the right body to do so.</p>

<a name="80124-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08012455000260"></a>Fourthly, we need to recognise that we will win against terrorism and terrorists only by engaging in dialogue, and deploying argument and example, rather than by seizing on force as the immediate way to win that argument. We must realise, in particular, that you cannot impose democracy on a country by force. Democracy has to be built from the bottom in a society; it cannot be delivered from above.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08012455000261"></a>Fifthly, we must realise that in the Middle East, and the Islamic world in particular, the fate of the Palestinians is not a sideshow, nor an afterthought, but absolutely central to any understanding of the respect&#151;or lack of respect&#151;towards the West that is held across that entire region. The silence of many western Governments over what has been happening in the past few days in Gaza is something that we need, perhaps, to reflect upon.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08012455000262"></a>Sixthly, if you do invade, you must have a clear plan for what to do next. Do not stand by as looters take over, the national museum is stripped of its treasures and the entire government service and army are removed from their posts, creating a lethal combination of chaos and readily mobilised armed insurgent groups.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08012455000263"></a>Seventhly, you need to plan sensibly for peace and reconstruction. Perhaps we need to look at the role that our organisations, particularly DfID, can and should play in this process rather more closely than we have in the past.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08012455000264"></a>Eighthly, perhaps above all, you must know that war is never, and never should be, the first resort of policy. Sometimes, of course, military force may be necessary. I was part of the Cabinet that took the decision to take action in Kosovo; it was the right decision then, but war is not always the right decision. We must not allow one successful mission to lead us into thinking that others will automatically be right or easy. War is never easy. It is nasty, brutish, and it may, very often, be far from short. It is also full of unintended consequences. Actions entered into with entirely honourable motives turn out rather differently from what those who entered into them expected.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08012455000265"></a>These are some of the things that we need to consider for the future. There is a lot that we know and can do without having an inquiry. I happen to think that an inquiry would be useful, and would urge the Government to consider the call for an inquiry more readily and favourably than, perhaps, they have done until now. We know a lot about what went wrong and why. We need now, even before an inquiry takes place, to apply ourselves to not making the same mistakes again.</p>

It is a pleasure to be able to agree with everything that he said. Indeed, there was only one speech that I did not understand and with which I do not agree&#151;that of the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea. He is not in his place, so I do not propose to say why.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08012455000267"></a>The other speeches made the points in my speaking notes better than I could have put them myself. I think in particular of the noble Lords, Lord Owen and Lord Tugendhat, and the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, with whom on other occasions I have often disagreed. There is a sense of the House at this stage that needs no elaboration from me. So, why am I here? I was asked to speak; but for that, I would not be here at all. Therefore, I am not going to impress on noble Lords my view of how to accentuate what has been said. My view on that is virtually irrelevant.

One of those post-war consequences, as one noble Lord put it, is the escalation in suicide bombing since the botched operations in occupying Iraq. That is one consequence that nobody has yet mentioned. It has  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_373"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>escalated at the behest of al-Qaeda. Somehow, this has to be addressed. It is a most serious problem and a direct result of a botched invasion. Who is going to address it? It has to be dampened down and, somehow, the ashes of a holy war must be raked out of the hearth.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08012455000269"></a>It is not a lay problem. It can be addressed only by the Arab world, which understands that Islamic law as a state religion, diversely applied throughout the states, means governance by God as the master of man and the universe. What these bombers are doing is a matter of belief; there is no lay resolution. They have to be helped in some way. There must be an effort to contain what is going on. That can be done only by acknowledged clerics who are cognisant of the divergent interpretations of the Koran. We have to accept that they are divergent; for example, the way in which Islamic law operates in north Yemen is wholly different from how it operates in south Yemen. This problem can be approached only by the Arab world. Perhaps Saudi Arabia could be persuaded by diplomacy to set up a form of global debriefing exercise, with access to such global intelligence as could be made available, while masking all sources. Pre-emptive, proactive action could undoubtedly be taken to alleviate the problem. Noble Lords may think that I am mad but I am not; this problem can be addressed only in this way. One has to take some notice of the problem, and if what I suggest is not appropriate, then what is?</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08012455000270"></a>Another step towards learning a lesson could be the recognition that, as more than one noble Lord mentioned, our Parliament should not give approval to the armed invasion or occupation of a sovereign state unless it was satisfied that proper steps have been taken on the restoration of damage and on training so that POWs and civilians are not ill treated, and so on. There is a myriad of requirements on Parliament. Parliament must assure our forces that what is being done is lawful, that an assurance was asked for and given&#151;but that it was given on botched advice which muddled up self-defence of the realm against attack with the armed invasion and occupation of a sovereign state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08012455000274"></a>My niece, Lulu Norman, was recently in Damascus interviewing refugees. She has kindly allowed me to quote freely from her diary, which takes us to the heart of the problems&#151;the nightmares&#151;faced by Iraqi families in exile. In one woman&#146;s family, she says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08012455000525"></a>&#147;The TV in the corner [showed] American soldiers surrounding an Arab house; explosions follow. If her son hears a car engine backfire, he screams, thinking it&#146;s a car bomb ... He can&#146;t be left alone in the bedroom or have the light off. When she takes him to kindergarten he cannot play&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000488"></a>Then there is the sectarian divide:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08012455000526"></a>&#147;One man [for example] had gone to the wrong district in Baghdad by mistake; a militia inspection found he was a Sunni in a Shia area. The family searched [for him] ... then they received a phone call asking ... for 20 million Iraqi dinars. Her sister sold all her jewellery ... and friends gave money. The next call told them to pick up his body from the medical station. It was badly disfigured. His 12-year-old [daughter] is still in deep shock&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000275"></a>One woman, a computer programmer, had recently come to Damascus for medical treatment:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08012455000527"></a>&#147;On her way to work she&#146;d see terrible things: decapitated corpses ... forbidden to be moved under pain of death ... The soldiers had become increasingly brutal, there were more raids on homes and inspections, daily humiliations and theft of gold and mobile phones. &#145;Now,&#146; she said, &#145;people are even more determined to kill Americans&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000489"></a>We should take comments like those very seriously if any of us are still under the misapprehension that the US and the UK are seen as saviours in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08012455000276"></a>The diary continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08012455000528"></a>&#147;A labourer who&#146;d left his wife and five children in northern Iraq ... had returned to find things had deteriorated to a point he called inhuman or &#145;without the minimum conditions for life&#146;. He&#146;d never liked Saddam, but like so many others he wished him back. &#145;Now&#146; [he says] &#145;in every district an official is appointed who doesn&#146;t care about people&#146;s electricity, water or survival but only his personal interest&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000490"></a>What about the future for those families? Will they ever return to Iraq? One woman said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08012455000277"></a>We must face the fact that our record in accepting Iraqis, despite our role in the war and our responsibility as the principal ally of the US, has been dismal. According to the International Rescue Committee, we have one of the lowest protection rates in the EU. Of the 1,305 Iraqis who applied for asylum here in 2006, only 3 per cent received refugee status and 8 per cent were granted subsidiary protection. Compare that with a protection rate of 90 per cent in Sweden in the same year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08012455000278"></a>The US has made a strong commitment, thanks to huge moral pressure on Congress from the NGOs, and has a resettlement target this year of 12,000 Iraqi refugee admissions. However, Human Rights Watch has pointed out that 12,000 is the number of Iraqis who typically entered Syria every week in 2006, and that the US reached only one-quarter of its target last year. It has also highlighted the intolerable conditions

The Human Rights Watch report is entitled <I>Rot Here or Die There.</I> More than one in four refugees are Christians and the local Chaldean churches have tried to make up for their Government&#146;s inadequacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08012455000279"></a>The UK is almost alone in continuing to return asylum seekers to Iraq. Will the Minister confirm that the Home Office still believes its February 2007 operational guidance notes on Iraq which state that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000548"></a>&#147;there is generally freedom of movement within the country and it is unlikely that internal relocation would be unduly harsh for men, and women with partners or relatives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000491"></a>Surely those notes need to be reviewed. As we have heard, the UK has agreed in principle to resettle up to 500 Iraqis in Britain over the next fiscal year under the UK-UNHCR gateway protection programme, which will include many former interpreters and their dependants. However, the success of this programme is still in doubt. As we heard on Monday, it is dependent on a sufficient number of local authorities coming forward to participate.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08012455000280"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Corbett, and I were involved in a campaign to accept refugees from Indochina nearly 30 years ago. There was huge public sympathy for those refugees and our churches, charities and local authorities went out of their way to receive thousands of them into temporary housing and private homes. Many noble Lords will remember that the same happened at the time of Hungary in 1956 and again more recently in the case of Bosnia, although on a smaller scale.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08012455000281"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, has pointed out that Iraq is different for the reasons explained. But there is a lot of good will towards Iraq in the UK which is based on an extensive Iraqi community and many others who have relations or interests in Iraq. One glance at the Medical Aid for Iraqi Children newsletter shows how many charities, schools, churches and individuals are subscribing regularly, and have done throughout the war, to medical supplies for children in hospital in Iraq. It must be possible for the UK to accept a larger share of Iraqi refugees, many of whom will return when Iraq is safe. The Government&#146;s present argument, that they are focusing resources on reconstruction, does not seem to me to admit the extent of the present crisis.</p>

I have never had a problem in principle with an inquiry, but have rather more difficulty with what that inquiry should focus on. My preference by far would be to focus on the post-conflict failure, because it is this which now makes it difficult to justify the initial decision, which I supported and would support again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08012455000283"></a>On the point of my noble&#151;and very good&#151;friend Lord Smith, we have to be careful about the balance we attribute to the United Nations here.

Two of the most obvious examples are Idi Amin and Pol Pot, both of whom were removed not by western powers but by local ones. At the time I was strongly in favour of that.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08012455000284"></a>My other problem with a wider-scale inquiry is that, frankly, it would need to go back to 1991. That is where one of the mistakes was made; we failed to remove Saddam Hussein then. I understand the argument against, but importantly we would have had far greater international support and&#151;of particular importance&#151;more regional support had we done it at that time. I know there was opposition to it, particularly in the region because of the uncertainty about the stability of Iraq afterwards, but there would have been far greater support than now and Iran would have been less of a problem. It is bizarre that we took no action then&#151;a time when Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction against his own people. We would have had a far stronger position generally, and far greater help in dealing with the post-conflict situation.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08012455000285"></a>A wider inquiry would also have to acknowledge the failure of the sanctions regime. People often forget that particularly brutal dictators will often use the sanctions regime to punish their own internal opposition. Kurds, Shias and others will suffer while those on the side of the dictator, those who live in his home town and so on, will be protected. I often remind people of the years when you saw demonstrations on the television set of well dressed, well fed Iraqis demonstrating in favour of Saddam Hussein and against the sanctions, and the same clip would show you a starving baby in a hospital. It is the curious power of propaganda that people do not ask why the baby is starving if the people doing the demonstrating are well fed and well clothed.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08012455000286"></a>The post-conflict plan was severely flawed. Yet it is important that there was a plan and it was being worked on. A lot of it was being worked on here; there were frequent meetings at Wilton Park. There was a warning sign at Wilton Park in that it was getting difficult to get agreement between the Iraqis present about the future government of Iraq. That was a warning sign but, let us face it, we had had that situation before, going right back to the Second World War and what to do with Germany after the collapse of Hitler.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08012455000287"></a>The real failure in this area involved the divisions within the United States Administration. This an important point and often underestimated. It involved the struggle between Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz on the one side and Colin Powell on the other. Unfortunately&#151;in my view&#151;Donald Rumsfeld won that struggle and the Defense Department took over from the State Department on general post-war planning. Colin Powell, along with the generals, warned of the acute dangers of having too few troops in Iraq to maintain order after the removal of Saddam Hussein. That was absolutely right. It has always interested and struck me that Tony Blair&#146;s influence on George Bush was great in a one-to-one relationship. The failing then came because Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz&#146;s influence on George Bush was greater than Colin Powell and Tony Blair put together. That is a painful reality, but it is the reality. They said that the

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08012455000288"></a>That disfunctionality at the heart of the US Administration was part of the problem, but we could not deal with it. That does not excuse us for our mistakes, nor does it excuse us for the general failure of the post-conflict plan, but it is a mistake to say that the post-conflict plan was not there. A lot of good people worked on it on both sides of the Atlantic, but it failed. There are other reasons why, as well as those I have just given.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08012455000289"></a>I will not drag on for too long, but another reason has been referred to on a number of occasions: the decision by Paul Bremer to disband the police, army and other aspects of the state in May 2003, particularly the army. The army was of course the one organisation you could have used to maintain power; that is not dissimilar to the way in which we used Japanese armed forces to police areas with British or American officers and NCOs in 1945. It was not as though we had not done this before. For some reason that only Paul Bremer will know, the decision was made rapidly to abandon that. I often wonder how much influence we had on this, and it is one area where we could ask legitimate questions.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08012455000290"></a>The other area touched on by a number of people, such as my noble friend Lord Smith, is that of promoting democracy. I am a great fan of promoting democracy but&#151;this is important&#151;you should normally promote security and the rule of law first, and it is often better to promote local democracy before you promote national democracy. That is not always the case but it is certainly true for Iraq. I was in Iraq a few weeks ago, and it is clear that the local democracy bid is working much better than national democracy, partly because of the tribal splits and a voting system that tends to reinforce those splits rather than heal or bridge them. The response by many political leaders in Iraq was one of cautious optimism, not least because it is working from the bottom upwards.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08012455000291"></a>There will be other occasions when we have to intervene, and it is important in the new world, post-Cold War, that we cannot walk away from these brutal dictators; nor should we. I find it offensive when some rather academic lawyers say that this was against the law. They ought to stand in front of the mirror and say to themselves, &#147;It is and ought to be unlawful to remove the Saddam Husseins, Adolf Hitlers&#148;&#151;or any of the others&#151;&#147;from power&#148;. Of course it is not unlawful. The problem is whether you can do it, and whether you make the situation better or worse by doing it.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08012455000292"></a>Finally, an important point on the failures is the hubris of the United States. The United States is in a similar position to that of Britain 100 years ago: it involves losing overall power and tending to over-estimate the power it has. That hubris&#151;whether displayed on the aircraft carrier at the end of the operations, as referred to previously, or when capturing Saddam Hussein and showing him having his teeth inspected on television&#151;said to the Arab world generally that we were triumphant and they were defeated. The loss

A number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, referred to the feeling in the region of the dominance of the West. It is an important point, and the United States has got to address it as it comes to terms with the position that we came to terms with at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

It provided an opportunity to raise the increasing concerns of many in your Lordships&#146; House. I speak among great experts, and I do so with some trepidation. I will concentrate my comments on the plight of women in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08012455000294"></a>Violence against women has greatly increased after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Where a better, open and democratic vision was promised to the people of Iraq, it seems that women have increasingly become the victims of horrific and appalling violence at the hands of all sectors of society, be they tribal or religious. Laura Sandler&#146;s article, &#147;Veiled and Worried in Baghdad&#148;, summed it up perfectly for me. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="08012455000530"></a>&#147;In Afghanistan, women threw off their burqas when American forces arrived. In Baghdad the veils have multiplied&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000492"></a>Iraqi women are living in fear. They die for belonging to the wrong sect, for helping fellow women and for wanting to work and be educated. They live in fear of defying the strict new prohibitions on dress and behaviour applied by both Shia and Sunni militants. Sadly, they live in fear of their husbands and other male relatives. Women&#146;s rights have been undermined by the country&#146;s post-war constitution, which has taken power from the family courts and given it to the clerics. Women are threatened with death unless they wear the full abbaya, the black all-encompassing veil; yet, paradoxically, the same men who enforce this are responsible for carrying out or ordering the rape and murder of women outside their sects and communities.</p>

<p><a name="08012455000493"></a>Strong anecdotal evidence collected by organisations such as the Iraqi Women&#146;s Network suggests that rape is often used as a weapon in the sectarian war to humiliate families from rival communities. A spokeswomen for the network said that you could call it &#147;collateral rape&#148;. One former deputy Human Rights Minister in Iraq agrees that there are increasing incidents of rape occurring across Iraq. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="08012455000531"></a>&#147;&#145;We blame the militias. But when we talk about the militias, many are members of the police ... This is the worst time ever in Iraqi women&#146;s lives. In the name of religion and sectarian conflict they are being kidnapped and killed and raped. And no one is mentioning it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08012455000295"></a>This violence would not be possible without a wider allowance for brutalising the lives of Iraqi women. The Government of Iraq have allowed ministries run by religious parties to segregate staffing by gender and female staff to be subjected to death threats and worse. With the undermining of the family code of Iraq, established in 1958, which guaranteed women a large measure of equality in the key areas of marriage, divorce and inheritance, this has now been superseded

It has seen the re-emergence of men contracting multiple marriages and women forced back under the veil and into the house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08012455000494"></a>In the chaos of the coalition-backed Government who control Iraq, thousands of women and girls across the country have been subjected to horrific rapes, abduction and trafficking. Does the Minister know whether statistical evidence can be produced to show that the Iraqi Government are taking seriously the issue of women&#146;s abuses? Have they evidence to show that positive action is being taken by the law enforcers against those perpetrating crimes against women? In the cases of burnings, of which 400 cases were reported in 2006, is he able to say if these incidents are automatically investigated, with or without the consent of families? Will the Minister also say how much funding is going into directly supporting female victims of these vile crimes and how is that being monitored?</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08012455000495"></a>The Iraqi penal code prescribes leniency to all those who commit crimes for &#147;honourable motives&#148;. I cite a case of a brother who accused his sister of adultery and wanted to kill her to restore his family&#146;s honour. For him, democracy meant he could do whatever he wanted, as, increasingly, family disputes were settled by local religious authorities. Can the Minister say whether his talks with Iraqi Ministry for Women&#146;s Affairs and the Ministry for Human Rights were open and free, without fear of intimidation in those ministries? Can he tell us whether real progress can be foreseen and that, as far as he is aware, the practice of honour killing is not safeguarded in the Iraqi constitution under any other name?</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08012455000496"></a>I did not approve of Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime, but neither did I approve of the invasion of Iraq. To date, the Government have refused an honest and open debate by not allowing a full inquiry. In the mean time, what is inexcusable is that an environment has been created in which oppression has been re-enforced by empowering the very factions that make it their business to terrorise women and civilians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08012455000497"></a>I have spent several days reading very graphic, disturbing accounts of experiences endured by women&#151;acts so horrible that it is hard to believe that one human being could be so cruel to another.

Many noble Lords have spoken about the situation in Iraq, and so I shall not go over it. Instead, I shall ask a slightly different question. Like some noble Lords, I strongly believed that the war on Iraq was thoroughly misconceived and would go down in history as a disastrous misjudgment and an act of unforgivable folly. I said so at the time both in and outside the House. The war was opposed by about 90 per cent of the world&#146;s population, 92 per cent of the membership of the United Nations and almost all the religious leaders whom one cares to think of. The question that

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08012455000297"></a>What lessons can be learnt about the quality of our democracy and decision-making in a society such as ours in order to avoid wars of this kind? There are five or six important lessons that we need to learn. First, much was made during the lead up to the war on the available intelligence about Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction and the imminent threat that it posed. As we know, the intelligence was inconclusive, misinterpreted and even doctored. In such sensitive matters, we have no choice but to rely on the report of the Government, based on the kind of intelligence available to them. We have no way to check the intelligence or the kind of judgment that the Government reach. How can we ensure that in future intelligence is not doctored, misinterpreted or used to serve decisions taken independently of it? That is the first important lesson that we need to learn. I should have thought that one way in which we might deal with such a situation is to ask half a dozen impartial privy counsellors with considerable experience in this area&#151;especially foreign affairs and defence&#151;to look at the evidence and reassure Parliament and the country that the intelligence implies what it is taken to imply.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08012455000298"></a>The second important lesson has to do with the way in which the authority to declare war is exercised. To his credit, Tony Blair consulted Parliament, which was an unusual but important step. Gordon Brown has learnt the lesson and has said that in future wars of this kind would be undertaken with parliamentary approval. I am glad to hear this because I think that we are beginning to learn an important lesson, but it is not enough. When a political party has a large majority, it can easily rely on arm-twisting and other kinds of pressure to gets its way. We need to guard against this. I should have thought, therefore, that parliamentary approval should include not only the House of Commons but the House of Lords, too. After all, your Lordships' House is considerably experienced and the only place in the world that I know of where you have retired Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and others. I should have thought that a debate about the war should have considerable input from your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08012455000299"></a>The third lesson that we have to learn has to do with how decisions on going to war are taken. Who makes an input? It surprises me that people are surprised at the situation; anyone with any knowledge of Iraq could easily have warned the Government about it, as some historians warned that the consequences that we have subsequently seen were going to follow. Insurgency was inevitable; the Shia-Sunni balance was delicate and likely to fracture. I am surprised that regional experts&#151;not just academics such as myself, but also diplomats with experience in the area&#151;were not fully consulted or encouraged to make an input. To the best of my knowledge, there was only one meeting where the then Prime Minister consulted academics and regional experts. They warned him away from the course of action that he was contemplating and were never consulted again. This is not the way to take decisions of this kind.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_381"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 381</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08012455000300"></a>The fourth lesson concerns the way in which we defend wars of this kind in the name of promoting democracy. One wrong conclusion to draw would be that we should not try to foist democracy on other countries. That is too simplistic and I do not think it would work, because where dictators are engaged in, for example, ethnic cleansing, we cannot remain indifferent. So what should we do? I have noticed, both in your Lordships&#146; debate and in the literature that has followed the war in Iraq, that there is an increasingly important distinction drawn between promoting democracy and promoting constitutionally limited government. Promoting full-blooded democracy from outside is impossible, because democracy requires an appropriate political culture that you cannot impose from outside. A constitutionally limited government would safeguard the rights of individuals and minorities, and an outside agency can be depended upon to promote a regime of rights and liberties, rather than a fully fledged electoral democracy. It is also important to bear in mind that we promote constitutional government not by threatening and imposing it, but by a suitable mixture of incentives and pressure&#151;as used systematically by the EU in relation to accession countries. That is the way to promote constitutional government&#151;not by resorting to war.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08012455000301"></a>Another lesson we must learn concerns the role of the media. In the United States, where I spent some time during the Iraq conflict, I was struck by the fact that almost all the media, including Fox television, represented only one point of view. The result was that the public had no access to alternative ways of thinking. Mercifully, in Britain, this was not the situation. By and large the British print and television media were responsible. I pay particular tribute to the BBC. In spite of being leaned upon and bullied by the Government, it did not abdicate its responsibility to present an alternative point of view and to investigate Government claims about intelligence and other matters. The lesson is that the independence of the BBC must be fully respected and that it should be encouraged to become even more investigative and daring in situations of war and crisis.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08012455000302"></a>Lastly, as a loyal member of the Labour Party, I cannot help asking a counterfactual question. If Labour had been in opposition, would the war have taken place? With Labour in power, there is tremendous pressure on grass-roots opinion to silence dissent and not be too vocal. In the Cabinet, too, there is a tendency for dissent not to be expressed. But countless millions of us did dissent, including the million who marched and many others who would have if they could. The question therefore is, if Labour had been in opposition&#151;I am not saying it should have been&#151;would it not have mobilised popular opinion to a far greater degree than took place? I believe that a Conservative Government&#151;or whatever Government were in power&#151;would not then have dared to take this country into war. Therefore we in the Labour Party need to ask ourselves how we can make sure that the party to which we are loyal and that we love, when in government, does not betray its own principles and embark upon adventures that in opposition it would be the first to condemn.</p>

I, too, would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for introducing this debate. I listened to his eloquent speech with great interest, and it provoked me into changing certain opinions I had before coming into this Chamber.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08012455000304"></a>I want to focus briefly on the current situation in Iraq. The latest American figures suggest civilian that deaths are down 75 per cent on a year ago. Last month, the overall number of deaths, including among Iraqi and allied forces, may have been the lowest since the war began. I agree with noble Lords on all sides of this Chamber who have stressed that the situation is still precarious. There is much that is in doubt. In particular, there is the political issue of the ability of the al-Maliki Government to reach out to Sunni interests, transcend sectarian identification and develop a genuine Iraqi identity. There is also the current state of play among those Sunni tribes that have moved away from al-Qaeda&#151;in a development that has been enormously important and positive for Iraq&#151;and the proper integration of those tribes eventually into genuine Iraqi armed forces. These questions remain unsettled. There is apparent considerable improvement, despite the violence of recent days. There is no certainty, but there is the possibility that we could not have talked about a year ago that the battle of Baghdad, brutal though is has been, has been won. I have lived in a city in which grisly sectarian bombing and slaughter was the order of the day. Eventually something switches and a tipping point is reached. We have not quite reached that point in Baghdad, but we are at a point where we might think it can be reached, and where we can talk about stability in a country with tremendous oil resources, which will be hugely to its advantage in the next few years.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08012455000305"></a>Despite this improvement, there is one area that has already been discussed by a number of noble Lords in which we have to acknowledge great difficulty, and that is the condition of women, particularly in the Basra area. Just before Christmas, the police chief talked of 50 recent murders of women by religious zealots. In the past two days, I have met a delegation from the Iraqi Women&#146;s League, who suggested that murderous attacks on women in the Basra area were running at one a day. I add my voice to those of other noble Lords in asking the Minister to outline the Government&#146;s attitude to the situation in Basra. This Government has a particular responsibility. We would be grateful for a response from the Government on the plight of women in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08012455000306"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, concentrated on the need for an inquiry. As the former historical adviser to the Bloody Sunday inquiry, I have to declare an interest. The Bloody Sunday inquiry&#146;s name was taken in vain. It is understandable that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, among others, has said that we do not want a repeat of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, with the expense and the advantage that accrued to lawyers. As an historian, in no way will I defend lawyers. But I do say that this inquiry has taken so  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_383"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>long principally because it is so very difficult to reach the truth about what happened in Derry on one afternoon in 1972. Many people believed before the inquiry was announced that they knew, and yet we are still struggling. I assure you that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville, has a genuine problem in reaching the truth&#151;it has taken so long, because that is extremely difficult.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08012455000307"></a>That is one general health warning. Even if we do not follow that model, which is ridiculously expensive, it is very difficult to reconstruct historical realities and contexts. Let me give an example from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, which hugely impressed me. He did not mention 9/11. For Tony Blair and his Cabinet, as for George Bush, without 9/11 there would have been no Iraq. Even though the connections are complicated, there is no question but that without 9/11 there would have been no Iraq. That is a crucial context. Another crucial context is that in the 1990s many people&#146;s immediate experience was of the way in which communist regimes had fallen and the relatively easy transition to democracy in many former communist countries. We now know that that was, in a certain sense, an illusory model. We now know that regimes fuelled by ethno-national sectarian passion have more of a life&#151;as in the case of the Baathist regime in Iraq&#151;than regimes that were promoted by the ideologies of communism and socialism. It is difficult to recreate these contexts, but no British Cabinet&#151;or American Cabinet, for that matter&#151;could have avoided them at the time.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08012455000308"></a>This is the difficulty with inquiries: it is hard to be fair or just. There have been assumptions by some today that Foreign Office advice was, or may have been, good but was not heard; others have had the assumption that it may not have been good. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, gave a dramatically interesting example of Foreign Office advice that seemed extremely powerful; he suggested that, if it had been followed, things might have been different. On the other hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, the decision to win a vote in the United Nations&#151;a vote that could never have been won and for which a major price was paid in terms of British influence on the United States&#151;was taken at least in part, presumably, on Foreign Office advice. These are exceptionally difficult matters.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08012455000309"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Soley, with whose views on foreign policy I am in much sympathy, I have no opposition in principle to an inquiry. It has to be conceded that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has made a powerful case. I take the observations of the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, seriously, but they are an argument about timing, although I understand that argument.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08012455000310"></a>Let me give just one other example of the difficulties that we face. Many Members of this House will remember the 2004 report of my noble friend Lord Butler on weapons of mass destruction; indeed, the contributions of my noble friend were accurately recalled by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. The report has that famous and carefully sculpted last paragraph, which implies that Mr Blair&#146;s informal style of government exacerbated the difficulties in formulating policy on Iraq. There is  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_384"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no question about that. However, let me also remind noble Lords of the first paragraph. If we are to take the report seriously, as I think we should, we must also take seriously its opening; indeed, we must take seriously the whole body of the report and the complex material that it presents about the difficulties of intelligence gathering and assessment. The report opens with these words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08012455000532"></a>&#147;Much of the intelligence that we receive in war is contradictory, even more of it is plain wrong, and most of it is fairly dubious. What one can require of an officer, under these circumstances, is a certain degree of discrimination, which can only be gained from knowledge of men and affairs and from good judgement. The law of probability must be his guide&#148;.</p>

We are running pretty short of time, so I wonder whether he could draw his remarks to a conclusion.</p>

I will simply conclude by saying that, if we are to have an inquiry, we must accept, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, that it cannot be partisan, that it must be open-ended and that it must fully respect the difficulties faced by all those who were involved in making these decisions at the time.</p>

When we consider the situation in Iraq, it seems to me to be a good idea to look at some of the historical trails that have formed the country and at its geographical position in the Middle East.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08012455000314"></a>Mesopotamia, as it used to be called&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Owen, mentioned that so effectively by quoting Kipling&#151;lies broadly between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, which run from sources in Turkey south-south-east into the Gulf. Control of the waters of these two rivers comes from abroad&#151;from Turkey&#151;which is a source of weakness. Together with the serious situation created by the reckless way in which Saddam Hussein destroyed the salt marshes, that makes it imperative to come to urgent regional agreement to apportion water fairly to all peoples dependent on them. Oil, which Iraq possesses in abundance, is vital to the nation&#146;s prosperity, but essential stability must depend on guaranteed supplies of water. What are the Government doing to ensure that discussions to achieve this take place as soon as possible?</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08012455000315"></a>Iraq is the site of the world&#146;s oldest known civilisation, the Sumerian. It was briefly part of the Persian, Hittite and Roman empires. It was an important adjunct to the Turkish Ottoman empire from 1533 to 1916. On the break-up of that empire, a Hashemite prince from Saudi was, in 1921, brought to rule by the British under a League of Nations mandate. This mandate was terminated in 1932 and the monarchy, with British support, lasted until 1958, when it was overthrown. A series of palace coups covered the next 20 years until 1979, when Saddam Hussein achieved power as an absolute ruler. As we

He invaded Kuwait in 1990, only to be thrown out in 1991 by Operation Desert Storm.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08012455000316"></a>In March 2003, as we know, Iraq was invaded by a coalition primarily from the USA and Britain. From then until now, there has been a continuing and debilitating struggle to stabilise the country and to establish as firmly as possible a central Government in Baghdad composed of elements from the Sunni and Shia communities and the Kurds. Slowly, both in Baghdad and in the south, lessons in counterinsurgency have been learnt. The British have now withdrawn the bulk of their forces. The Americans have vastly increased their commitment&#151;the surge. Both ploys appear to be working at the same time. Given continuing political and military support, a stable democracy&#151;a semi-democracy, at least&#151;may emerge. Some provinces are undoubtedly making better progress in this than others. In the past five years, the Americans have learnt well, albeit the hard way, how to deal with insurgents&#151;so much so that they are now considered to be as good as, or better than, the British at this essential task.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08012455000317"></a>How do we effectively combine military and civil powers at the same time? This is essential learning for all of us both in Iraq and Afghanistan. We and the Americans have perforce also had to learn how to fight wars in two conflicting theatres at the same time and how to balance competing demands for troops and materials. Hopefully, indeed certainly, we do learn and have learnt some lessons during this protracted period, but will we ever learn about the dangers of being caught by friendly fire? It seems not. We have learnt a lot about relatively simple things, such as how to keep reasonably healthy in desert war conditions, how to cope with searing heat, how to look after wounded soldiers in a quite exceptionally efficient manner and how to keep engines of tanks, other armoured vehicles and aircraft going when they are ingesting sand. We have had to consider how to train our troops in theatre and how to fight a vicious war at the same time as trying to build a nation.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08012455000318"></a>The British Army in Iraq, although much smaller than in recent years, is as efficient a fighting force as it ever has been in its glorious history. But, of course, much long-term training has had to be postponed and rest periods minimised. Let us hope that it will not be too long before the Army will be able to leave the Middle East and Afghanistan altogether, revert to normal patterns of activity and cease to be so overstretched. In the mean time, secondments from the Territorial Army, as in many years in the past, have been found to be most worth while. The soldiers and officers are very keen and professional, and indistinguishable in combat from the regulars. They also bring extra skills, and their excellence is one of the most important lessons that we have learnt in the past few years.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08012455000319"></a>We are all immensely proud of our Armed Forces, very grateful for the sacrifices that they have made and for their unquenchable spirits, which inspire us so much.</p>

I have been immensely impressed again by the noble Lords, Lord Fowler and Lord Tugendhat, and others. I strongly support a broader inquiry because the implications for British foreign policy of the Iraq invasion are very wide.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08012455000321"></a>If one accepts the argument made a number of noble Lords on all sides that the impact of the Iraq invasion is comparable to that of Suez, as we look back five years after the Iraq war, we should recollect how much Harold Macmillan's Government adjusted the assumptions of British foreign policy in the five years after Suez. He sped up the process of decolonisation. He accepted that Britain had to re-establish a relationship with the United States, recognising that Britain was the junior partner, and reluctantly, and under pressure first from the Eisenhower Administration and then from the incoming Kennedy Administration, he recognised that we had to apply to join what was then the European Economic Community. They were major adjustments to British foreign policy&#151;the last major adjustments, in effect, to British foreign policy. Five years after the Iraq invasion, what adjustments have we seen under two Prime Ministers? We have seen very little. That is the issue an inquiry now ought to address.</p>

<a name="80124-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08012455000322"></a>It would be as difficult for the Conservative Front Bench as for the Government: the Conservative Party, after all, has clung more closely to the world view of the American Republicans than has new Labour. I notice the deep investment by American think tanks in co-opting the Conservative Party as far as they can. We have all noticed the alienation of the Conservative Party from its European Conservative counterparts. The Conservatives wish to follow the United States rather than work with the French and Germans, which I suggest is now the way forward&#151;and I support everything that my noble friend Lord Lee said about the desirability of working more closely with our French partners rather than always bumping along behind the United States.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08012455000323"></a>There are clear lessons to learn from what we understand about the special relationship. In effect, we tested the special relationship to destruction under the impact of the move to war in Iraq. It was a revelation of just how junior a partner of the United States we had now become. In the 1950s and 1960s, we could still hope to have a high degree of intellectual influence in Washington. Many people in Washington still knew their counterparts in London: they had worked with them during the war. They respected their understanding of the world and we were spending a great deal of money&#151;I am not sure entirely wisely&#151;maintaining British defences east of Suez, so we were a global power alongside the United States. It was a real, special relationship.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08012455000324"></a>Now, we are one among a number of partners. Israel, as we have discovered, has a much stronger special relationship with political power in Washington  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_387"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 387</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than the British. Mexico, Japan and other countries also have their special relationships, not forgetting Ireland. We now have to decide what sort of relationship we want to establish not only with the outgoing Bush Administration, but with the incoming successor. Of course, the Bush Administration has been exceptionally ideological and we may hope that its successor will take a very different view. But American foreign policy emerges out of a very self-referential debate, so long as there is no external counterbalance to force the avid arguers of Washington to think about the outside world. Domestic lobbies, domestic intelligentsia, the power of money, and the funding of right-wing think tanks all play a large part.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08012455000325"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, remarked that we need actively to prepare to come to terms with whatever it is that the next Administration asks us for, and we need to prepare on a European basis rather than simply a British basis. When I was working at Chatham House many years ago, I remember that very odd period when the US Administration changed every four years from Ford to Carter to Reagan, and each time a team would come over and say, &#147;This is the way we have to see the world. Forget about what the last Administration told you and forget about your own domestic constraints; this is where you have to follow us, because otherwise we will have tremendous problems with Congress&#148;. We shall have that again in the middle of 2009. We need to be working with our partners on the European continent to have a coherent response that relates to the Middle East, Russia and elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08012455000326"></a>One thing that strikes me most about this whole episode is how clear American policy was. For those of us who had followed the group who became the neoconservatives from the 1960s onwards, it was always clear what their world would be like. I remember in the late summer of 1967, when still a graduate student, I went with my then girlfriend to visit Eugene Rostow, then US Assistant Secretary of State, whom I had known when he was still a professor. He explained to us that the 1967 Middle East war was not a local war but part of the Soviet plan to outflank NATO through its soft underbelly. That was a very particular view of the way in which Israel fitted into the geopolitics of the Middle East.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08012455000327"></a>I happened to know Paul Wolfowitz and others when I was still a student over there and many others of us have continued to argue with them. The aides to Senator Jackson, the Committee on the Present Danger and the Project for the New American Century all set out the policy very clearly, and Rumsfeld, Cheney and others were closely connected with that. I therefore ask myself, what were our embassy staff in Washington reporting to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Office from 2001 to early 2003? Were they not telling us how much the American drive was being pushed by ideological preconceptions rather than by hard, thought-through intelligence?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08012455000328"></a>I remember on behalf of the LSE being at a meeting of the association of American schools of international politics in November 2001 in which Condoleezza Rice said, &#147;We have forgotten that we

That was a real revelation from someone who was then the National Security Council adviser. I remember going to a National Intelligence Council conference in early 2002 in which it appeared to many of us that the regional experts from the CIA and elsewhere were part of the opposition to their own Administration. If I may say so, as an outside expert and Opposition politician, I have also been struck by the fact that over the past five years I have had much more open contact with members of the US intelligence community than I have ever had with members of the British intelligence community&#151;and I suspect that that is also something that an inquiry should look at. It would help a little if our intelligence agencies did have a rather more open dialogue with those outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08012455000329"></a>When it came to the only occasion on which members of my party were offered an intelligence briefing in late 2002, we were told nothing that we had not already worked out for ourselves from public sources and were left wondering whether we had not been told what we needed to know or whether there was not anything more to know that we had not already discovered.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08012455000330"></a>There are other lessons to be drawn. There is of course the lesson about Afghanistan, in which five years were lost after the expulsion of the Taliban before we really began to invest heavily in the reconstruction of that country, from which the British Army is now suffering. We would like to know how far British Ministers stressed to our American partners in 2002 that Afghanistan ought to be the priority and were overruled. There are a large number of lessons about the Middle East region as a whole.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08012455000331"></a>We understand from what has been published that Prime Minister Blair thought that he had from President Bush the assurance that after the successful invasion of Iraq, the Arab/Israel conflict would be the first item on the American agenda. There again we have lost five years until President Bush has at last, and very late, come round to accepting that. We need to know a little more about policy towards Iran now that we also know that in 2003 the then Iranian Government attempted to strike a much more positive and open relationship with the United States, which was refused. I have just been reading Ali Ansari&#146;s very interesting new ISS paper on Iran in which he talks about the disastrous impact on Iranian reformists of the axis of evil speech.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08012455000332"></a>There are lessons also about the impact of the Iraq invasion on our British Muslim population. When addressing very large meetings of British Muslims in Lancashire and Yorkshire in the months that followed that invasion, I certainly found that they were very disturbed by the implications of what they saw as an anti-Muslim invasion.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08012455000333"></a>There are lessons about prerogative powers to which this House will return next Thursday.

From estimates provided by the House of Commons Library on the additional costs of being involved in Iraq, I note that we have spent nearly &#163;6 billion extra so far. Lastly, there are lessons about the capabilities

But the broadest question is about the future of British foreign policy&#151;how much we see ourselves as continuing to be engaged in humanitarian intervention using our military abroad where needed, with whom and within what framework. Part of the cost of Iraq has been that the British were unable to play a role in the Republic of Congo, in Darfur&#151;beyond a very minimal one&#151;and in the Lebanon. How large do we see our responsibilities in maintaining and improving order in the world, and with whom&#151;always with the Americans, more often with the Europeans, and wherever possible within a NATO or UN framework? Those are the underlying questions which concern what British foreign policy is now really about.</p>

<a name="08012455000334"></a><b><a name="80124-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012455000692"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, this has been a very good debate full of speeches of power and great experience. In fact, I even dare to say&#151;having been here a mere 11 years myself&#151;that it was your Lordships' House at its best. I even thought for a moment that we might get some coverage for this debate as long as there were no distractions such as ministerial resignations. Unfortunately, there were such media distractions so we will be lucky to get a few column inches. However, this has been a valuable debate and we all owe a debt to my noble friend Lord Fowler for promoting it and putting the case for an inquiry&#151;that has run throughout the debate&#151;with brilliant clarity. As he mentioned, he had family links with what has gone on, as many of us have. My own son was in Basra in the Territorial Army, to which my noble friend Lady Park referred. For many of us the place may be rather far away but what has gone on is very close indeed.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08012455000335"></a>The theme throughout the debate was that of an inquiry, with most voices in favour. One of two noble Lords referred to the doctrine of unripe time&#151;about which my noble friend Lord Goodlad warned. But on the whole there was a strong feeling that the time has now come for a proper inquiry into all aspects of this matter. I would be the first to assert that we should collectively look forward and not back in Iraq and that, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, we are where we are, and that all efforts must now be directed at bringing Iraq into the comity of nations as, we hope, a united and potentially prosperous country. Nevertheless the case has been made very clearly that there are some vital lessons to be learnt from the past four bloody years. The cost to our own country has been high in lives lost and in resources. Of course, for America it has been very much heavier still, and still more so for the tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives lost in Iraq itself. There has been a rise in suicide terrorism, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the almost unspeakable violence against women of a kind which has now created in Basra an atmosphere where women fear to go out in case they are murdered, as my noble friend Lady Verma mentioned.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08012455000336"></a>The lessons we all want to learn are not just about ugly and tragic events but about the ideas and preconceptions behind them&#151;whether, for instance, it  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_390"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was right or wrong from the start to believe that there was a packaged form of democracy that could be exported and planted in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. That was a very simplistic Washington notion, rightly commented on by my noble friend Lord Lamont and the noble Lord, Lord Soley. There are lessons on whether in our own case we handled and formulated not just our military endeavours but our whole foreign policy in a wise and intelligent way in accordance with the proper principles of British government and collective Cabinet administration. Was Parliament allowed to play a proper role? Why did the intelligence go so disastrously wrong? We may have a little more information on that if the Government agree to obey the Information Commissioner&#146;s order to release the key dossier on weapons of mass destruction. We must never let that issue go. We have to ask why not enough attention was given to the history of Iraq, about which Britain, of all countries, knew more than anybody else. As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, just mentioned, we have to ask why we fell out so badly with our neighbours in the European Union. Was there ever a hope of a common European approach or was that just a pipe dream?</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08012455000337"></a>All this makes it almost obvious to us that the responsible and sensible thing to do, and do now, is to have an inquiry by an independent committee of privy counsellors to review what has happened in Iraq both before and since the invasion of 2003. My noble friend Lord Fowler put this with crystal clarity. I agree that it should not be a partisan affair. There is no point if it dissolves into being just a party give and take. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is right about that and so are the noble Lord, Lord Bew, and others.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08012455000338"></a>Of course it is true, as the Government have argued all along, that there have been various reports on this whole saga. There was the Hutton report on the death of Dr Kelly and the profound and brilliant report by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, into certain intelligence failures and apparently misleading statements or exaggerations by the then Prime Minister, and there was a Foreign Affairs Committee report from the other place, which unfortunately did not manage to get evidence from any of the key witnesses because they refused either to attend or, indeed, even to answer the letters requesting them to attend. So much for parliamentary accountability. But as was said by my noble friend and others, these were all snapshots. None of them looked at the whole grim picture and the catalogue of errors which we have seen unfold over the past four years.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08012455000339"></a>We now owe it to our brave Armed Forces and to the British people to hold an inquiry. We need it because we have reached a crucial point when the bulk of our troops are being withdrawn from Basra, leaving a garrison under Operation Overwatch&#151;a garrison which we must not betray by more muddled policy handling and failure to back up fully. The city of Basra is in a state very far removed from the one when my son served there in 2004. We need it because our ally, the United States, has held a series of major, full and deep inquiries and it is shaming that we have not, as my noble friend Lord King reminded us. We need it because we have had no overall assessment of how we entered this war or what planning we did to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_391"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>handle the aftermath and consequences, as many noble Lords said. I repeat that we need it because we owe it to the Armed Forces after all their sacrifices to show that we understand what went wrong, why equipment failed to reach them, what we now expect of them, and why budgetary difficulties made it so difficult to supply the right weapons and machinery. We need it because as a nation we need clear future guidance on our strategic purposes in Iraq and the whole region, and because it is essential to understand much more deeply the modalities of asymmetric warfare and the complex linkages between military and civil action, to which my noble friend Lord Luke referred, in pursuit of a restored peace. Above all, we need it because the course of the war is one of the top concerns of democratic peoples not only here but elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08012455000340"></a>Opinion experts are always telling us that domestic policies preoccupy the minds of the electorate, but they are wrong. The current American presidential election process proves them to be wrong. It is the foreign policy of a nation&#151;and our nation&#151;that tells us who we are, what our relationship is with the rest of the world, what our identity is, what the purposes of our society are and why we should continue building that society together. That is the case for the inquiry, which I believe to be overwhelming.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08012455000341"></a>Finally, let me consider the immediate future. We have the strategic initiative&#151;the so-called surge of General Petraeus. Has it worked? Some say that it has. The general&#146;s achievement in getting the Sunni cadres on-side in Anbar province could be a harbinger of better times, although others have warned that the Sunni leaders may be our friends this week but will by no means necessarily be our friends next week. We need to assess whether the key to development, which is private enterprise and investment, is now being turned. The IMF has said that Iraqi economic prospects are at last brightening, and the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, had some very interesting insights into the change in the business climate that is beginning to develop.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08012455000342"></a>We need to assess the oil prospects. There is enormous potential there if the Ministry of Oil in Baghdad can get contracts out and new investment going, and if it decides to mix the need for a national oil company, which is in the interests of the Iraqi people, with the expertise of the international oil companies. I am told that a very powerful report on that is about to come from the University of Surrey Energy Economics Centre. We need to clarify how we engage Iran positively and not negatively in this recovery process. For all the dark implications of Iran in Iraqi horrors, it is in the firm long-term interests of the Iranians to have a neighbour that is peaceable and which never attacks it again in the horrific way that it did in the 1990s.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08012455000343"></a>Beyond all that, we need to redefine that misleading phrase &#147;war on terror&#148;. Was it ever really a war? That is what my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon wisely asked right at the start. Is the only realistic path forward the one defined by the Muslim world itself, in which grass roots Muslim people and new and brave leaders finally turn against  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_392"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 392</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those who have hijacked their future in the false name of a false Islam? There are all sorts of things that we can do to help, but our strategy and tactics will have to change. In the end, the agents of change and stability will be the people of the Middle East themselves and their leaders. There is no peace to be imposed from outside. They will decide whether they live in peace and prosperity or in unending hatred, rivalry and insecurity.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08012455000344"></a>Let us have this inquiry now. Let us learn from our errors, so that we can help these suffering peoples to take the right path and to build societies that endure. I end with the words of Gertrude Bell, one of the founders of modern Iraq. Some 80 years ago, she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08012455000533"></a>&#147;Oh, if we can make them work together, and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing that would be&#148;.</p>

<a name="08012455000345"></a><b><a name="80124-0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012455000693"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My Lords, I join all who have congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on his prescience in raising this issue again today. Listening to the extraordinarily wise and varied contributions that have been made today, as other noble Lords have noted, and recognising the combined years of experience and wisdom in these matters that those speeches represent, one can draw only one conclusion when one hears more questions than answers in such a debate. There is clearly a need to establish as definitively as possible the facts. Many noble Lords have therefore called for an inquiry.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08012455000346"></a>One has listened to the litany of issues that have been raised: the causes of the war and the circumstances under which the war was entered into; the use or improper use of intelligence; the question of whether the war was fought with sufficient troops compared to the numbers in the earlier Gulf War of 1991; the early decisions made after the occupation on de-Ba&#146;athification and the standing down of the Iraqi army; the share or non-share in the operational responsibility of the UK with its United States partner; the nature of warfare that is being fought there, with its asymmetric character, which means that even if we have adjusted to conditions such as the desert and the sun, still the roadside ordnances that cost so many British, American and Iraqi lives continue to confound our military operations in many ways. The question has been raised about the advice of the Foreign Office and whether seasoned Arabists were ignored, or whether the officials were no better than the politicians in forecasting the difficulties that would follow.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08012455000347"></a>Have we subsequently, in the way in which we have addressed the problems and the humanitarian crisis of refugees and displacements, and in the responsibility that we have shown to special groups, such as those who were interpreters for our forces, shown sufficient generosity of spirit? What is the situation now and then in Basra, particularly regarding the terrible plight of women, against whom there has been so much violence? How permanent are the gains in security under the operations of General Petraeus and in our own partnership with Iraqi commanders in Basra?  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_393"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 393</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>How real are the economic gains that we see now with the growth of the Iraqi economy? How effective is reconstruction when there are still so many difficulties of infrastructure? Will the military and security improvements be followed by real political progress by the Iraqis themselves to allow a more permanent peace to take hold? Many noble Lords asked about the quality of the democratic institution-building that is taking place and whether we have sufficiently understood the nature of Iraqi society and shown sufficient patience for this slow business of building such institutions. Beyond that, there is the issue of Britain&#146;s changing posture in Iraq as we draw down the number of our troops in Basra.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08012455000348"></a>All of those are enormously important questions and, as has been acknowledged, many books have been written. Comment was made on Bob Woodward who nowadays is more an industry than an author with three books by him alone. There have been investigations and the noble Lord, Lord King, was too modest to mention the Channel 4 Iraq investigations of which he was one of the chairs. There have been investigations by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, the many books by both participants and observers of this issue. The fact that, in the end, a Chamber such as this is asking questions demonstrates that there is a need to come to more definitive conclusions about so many of these points and to do it in an objective way, as many noble Lords have stressed. Anyone who was left in doubt probably needed only to hear the echoing words of Kipling, read by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, to be reminded of the responsibility that all of us in this Chamber bear&#151;those of us who are Ministers or who were Ministers or in opposition then&#151;when young men and women go to war.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08012455000349"></a>We still come back to the issue, not of if there is an inquiry, but when. Let me take issue with the suggestion that the Baker-Hamilton report in the United States provides a parallel that we could adopt now. With due respect, that report was not an investigation of the kind of issues that have been raised here today; it was a very necessary look at the future options for the United States in moving forward. I, as one who was invited to talk to the members of that investigation, know that it was much more of a policy operation than an inquiry. I was not sworn in to give testimony; there was a very informal exchange with the co-chairs&#151;as was the case for most of those who provided evidence or information to it. It is fair to say that the United States, too&#151;although Congress has had a number of investigations&#151;has still not had that definitive examination of the causes that led to the war and its subsequent conduct.</p>

<a name="80124-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08012455000350"></a>I would do best to remind the House that the position of this Government is that indeed a time may come&#151;and I suspect definitively will come&#151;when such an inquiry is necessary. But we would still maintain that we have not yet reached it now. The former Foreign Secretary in another place said in June last year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08012455000534"></a>&#147;I made plain the Government&#146;s view that there would come a time when these issues would be explored in the round so that we could learn whatever lessons could be learnt from them&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/6/07; col. 539.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08012455000351"></a>As we are all aware, reference was made to the investigations relating to both Norway in 1940 and the Dardanelles in 1915. It is not just the argument that carrying out such inquiries while the war is underway might undermine the war effort or support for it. Equally important, on reading up about both cases, was that precisely because the investigations were conducted while operations were still underway, there was not the distance and perspective to offer anything like a definitive final word on what had happened to allow the inquiries to be non-partisan and objective sources of analysis and advice for the future. We owe it to ourselves and everyone who was involved in this venture that when we come to offer such analysis it will stand the test of time and be seen, as has been asked for here, as objective and fair.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08012455000352"></a>Let me turn quickly to some of the key issues that have been raised today and which perhaps do not have to wait for such an inquiry. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, with his long interest in refugees, did not surprise me when he raised the issue. There is now a new appeal for assistance for refugees in Jordan and Syria. He is right to describe it as the most expensive appeal that the UNHCR currently has. It is the most expensive operation with the second largest number of refugees anywhere in the world after Darfur. Britain is looking at what it can do to support that appeal, as we did last year. We have a resettlement programme that was discussed in a Question earlier this week. We shall continue to review that to make sure that we meet our obligations to those who work with us and more broadly to those who fear political persecution.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08012455000353"></a>On the concern that we might have drawn the refugee net too narrowly, let me assure your Lordships that we follow up very carefully to ensure that those who are returned to Iraq because they have failed to secure refugee status find the conditions to allow them to live freely. Given the insecurity in the country, however, we cannot ensure that it is necessarily always safe. We ensure that they face no particular threat because of their political views or ethnic or religious identity.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08012455000354"></a>I have no statistics to offer the noble Baroness on women&#146;s issues or, particularly, the violence against women,. However, that formidable fighter for the rights of women, Ann Clwyd, of the other House, remains the Prime Minister&#146;s special representative and she continues, with others of us, to raise these issues as firmly and frequently as she can with both the provincial and national authorities in Iraq.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08012455000355"></a>On reconstruction, the fact that there is now growth and some movement on an agreement on using oil revenues that we hope will allow the necessary foreign investment in that sector suggests that not only the security situation but the economic situation have turned in a positive and forward direction.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08012455000356"></a>I conclude by looking forward and picking up the remark made earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Owen. The Prime Minister should be credited with managing to bring down the level of our involvement in Basra. There is much more political support for an approach that entails better alignment, if you like, between what we are trying to do and what people think is a reasonable  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_395"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effort for us. It has allowed a de-politicisation of our military operations and a real opportunity for the generals to make the decisions on the troop levels needed and how long they are needed, thereby assuring those who fear we might leave too soon and others who fear the opposite. Besides the Prime Minister&#146;s first commitments on bringing down troop levels by the spring, the military situation on the ground and security in Basra will determine the pace of further troop withdrawals.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08012455000357"></a>More generally, looking forward, I think that for now we will have to park our search for definitive answers to the questions raised today. But as I and so many others have said today, the time for an inquiry will come. The absence of an inquiry should not block our agreeing on what we agree about and moving forward. We have heard from noble Lords who took very different views on the war and its correctness when it was initiated&#151;from the debate&#146;s sponsor, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, who indicated that he supported it at first but now feels a special requirement to know the truth about the intelligence and other information on which he made that decision, to others who opposed the war from the beginning and who equally feel that they carry the burden of wanting to understand for future generations how such a war was entered into.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08012455000358"></a>Let us consider what divided us then and what brings us together now. A reference was made to what Macmillan learnt after Suez. I would argue that this Government have learnt, first, the need to strengthen parliamentary control over the country going to war. That is part of the Prime Minister&#146;s constitutional proposals. Secondly, the Security Council needs to be strengthened and not weakened so that it might rubber-stamp such conflicts in future. Its representativeness and authority need to be increased. It needs to be made the high point of the multilateral arrangements and an even stronger force in how we conduct international security affairs.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08012455000359"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, suggested that the Conservatives had both deserted Europe and thrown themselves into the arms of Washington. I feel bound to leap to the defence of noble Lords opposite. One of the great surprises of sitting in this Chamber has been to find that if Washington think tanks have spent any money on how to put a &#147;neo-&#148; in front of noble Lords opposite, it has&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, so eloquently said&#151;been to little effect. I hear little support from the other side for a pro-Washington policy on this. A fairer critique is that the Conservative Party has become the proverbial canoe with no oars left at all, neither a European oar nor a Washington one.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08012455000360"></a>More generally, perhaps we can all agree with the general direction that we are seeking to develop under the Prime Minister, which is to strengthen multilateralism but not as an alternative to strong relationships with Europe and the United States. I have always argued that a strong United Nations without a strong American commitment to it is impossible. Instead, creating a multilateral framework of rules and laws in the security sphere, as in so many others, allows us effectively to play out our alliances in a way which secures global support for our objectives in dealing with situations  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_396"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as Iraq or Kosovo and our other objectives in completely different areas of life. Something therefore really has come out of the debate: a renewed commitment to multilateralism on both sides of this House.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08012455000361"></a>Equally, out of this debate has come the recognition that there is now a surprising crack of light in Iraq. The security situation is much better than most of us had ever hoped it might be. It has created the possibility for political and economic recovery. It is a fragile and narrow possibility. But in looking over our shoulder at what went wrong, let us not lose sight of this astonishing opportunity and challenge ahead.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08012455000362"></a>If we can work together with our partners in Iraq and in the United States, the United Nations and the European Union, there is still a possibility of resurrecting and recovering some of the ground lost in Iraq and meeting our obligations to try and allow the Iraqi people to have a country of which they can be proud, where they can freely enjoy their right to choose their own Government and make their own destiny.</p>

I thank everyone who has taken part in this short debate. The fact that there have been 25 speakers speaks volumes for the feeling and urgency with which the House regards the subject.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08012455000364"></a>There have been powerful speeches. Obviously I do not have time to go through them all. Suffice it to say that most of those who spoke from all parts of the House backed the proposal for an inquiry and for it to be set up now. Even those who did not seemed to raise so many questions that they might reflect that a comprehensive inquiry is about the only way in which they will ever be answered.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08012455000365"></a>I was encouraged by what the Minister said at the start of his reply when he said that we as a nation needed to discover the facts. He then set out a series of questions which, frankly, summarised the case we have been making for having an inquiry now to look at exactly these issues. I thought that he made our case. He stressed&#151;I think I cite him accurately&#151;the need to come to a more definitive conclusion. That is what I and my colleagues and noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches, the government Benches and the Cross Benches have been saying for the past four hours. It seems that the Government&#146;s case is not whether there should be an inquiry, but when. They have accepted the principle of an inquiry. To that extent we have moved forward from February&#146;s position, and that is significant indeed.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08012455000366"></a>The Minister then argued, and this was the great disappointment of his speech, that an inquiry could not take place now because we needed some &#147;distance of perspective&#148;. I was not sure what the phrase meant. However, I should point out that we are approaching the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the conflict when the troops went in. How many years will we have to wait before the Government believe that the time is ripe?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08012455000367"></a>Regrettably, I do not accept the Minister&#146;s case. He might reflect that there has not been overwhelming support&#151;I could put it much more strongly&#151;for the

Like the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, I do not accept that we are doing enough for the 4 million refugees that have been tragically created by this conflict. Above all I do not accept that an inquiry cannot be set up until all the troops have been withdrawn. If that is so, this is will drag on year after year and Ministers will, as the Minister did today, unhappily come to the Dispatch Box and make the kind of defence that he offered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08012455000368"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lamont said, simply the scale of deaths in Iraq&#151;is it 100,000; it may be 150,000&#151;makes the case for having an inquiry now. We would not dream of allowing that to simply pass by in any other circumstances. We cannot just blame the Americans for a lack of planning. It is a convenient argument, but, as my noble friend Lord Tugendhat said, it begs every question in the book about our relationship. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, that we must move forward. Of course we must. But surely we should move forward on the basis of the lessons that can and should be learnt about this conflict. I am putting a bipartisan point.</p>

Parliament should insist that an inquiry take place and that it take place now. I very much hope that it will. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08012455000373"></a>In 1995, the then shadow Chancellor, a Mr Gordon Brown, vowed to make a bonfire of quangos and sweep away the quango state. In fact, under the aegis of this Admninistration, the quango state has grown enormously since 1997, with more than 700 extra bodies created. Nor can this just be attributed to this Administration. The new Scottish Nationalist Administration, elected in May on a promise to have a Scottish bonfire of quangos, has managed to create 24 new quangos since taking up office despite that promise.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08012455000374"></a>I have found it almost impossible to divine the extent of the quango state. The Economic Research Council has published <I>The Essential Guide to British

According to it, gross expenditure grew from &#163;146 billion in 2004 to &#163;174 billion in 2006. The growth in staff numbers over the past decade has been impressive, with many quangos more than doubling in size. The Student Loans Company, for example, employed 984 people in 2007 compared with 432 in 1998 and its costs have increased from &#163;19 million to &#163;57 million, a threefold increase. Spending on government and quango press officers alone has been estimated at more than &#163;330 million, and the Nolan rules on appointments have been good news for head-hunters and recruitment agencies.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08012455000375"></a>In paragraphs 20 and 21 of its sixth report, the Select Committee on Public Administration recommended,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000549"></a>&#147;that the Government brings together information about the range of organisations carrying out its policy in a single directory, combining the information given at present in <I>Public Bodies</I> with other, summary information about departmental roles, and how departments deliver policy through other bodies, and how all of these bodies relate to one another ... Such a publication would provide a comprehensive &#145;map&#146; of the Government, and organisations which carry out functions on its behalf. It should more clearly classify such bodies; show how much each organisation spends in public money, and where this money comes from; what is the legal status of each organisation; who sets the policy of each organisation; who appoints its members, and how they are appointed; and what information each organisation publishes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000499"></a>That was in 1999, and the Government have done nothing, more than eight years on, to implement that simple and very sensible recommendation that would shine a light on the extent of the growth of quangos.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08012455000376"></a>Indeed, the Government have moved backwards. In 2006, they ended the publication of <I>Public Bodies</I>, the only&#151;somewhat inadequate&#151;directory of these bodies available, arguing that the information would be available by going to each department&#146;s website. I have tried that. You could spend a lifetime mining the data on those websites and get nowhere close to the extent of the quango state. Of course, the Government have something to hide. Far from abolishing the quango state, they have nourished it and allowed it to get completely out of control. Quangos are used or established to hive off difficult decisions by this Government. This Government have created hundreds of task forces, action teams and working parties and has more tsars than the Romanovs. The coincidental, I am sure, involvement of party supporters and donors does not help with its credibility.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08012455000377"></a>The Minister has no idea how much the taxpayer spends on quangos or what is achieved by that expenditure. These bodies have now taken on a life of their own. The Electoral Commission, for example, which is directly accountable to Parliament, not to Ministers, did not exist 10 years ago and will spend more than &#163;100 million between general elections. Noble Lords may be astonished by that figure; I was. I expected the Electoral Commission to spend perhaps a couple of million pounds a year at most, but it spent &#163;21.5 million in 2005-06 and has a budget of &#163;26.2 million for 2006-07. Expenditure by all the political parties on a general election campaign will amount to much less than half of the &#163;100 million that the Electoral Commission will spend between general

Postal vote scandals, the tens of thousands disenfranchised in the Scottish elections and the confusion over donations suggest that its existence has not delivered value or improved the democratic system. Not that I am singling it out as being exceptional; I just thought it might be on Ministers&#146; minds on this day more than most quangos.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08012455000378"></a>Every post brings to Members of this House and the other place yet another glossy publication from yet another public body, most of which are, I suspect, often instantly recycled, unread, via the waste basket. The waste is absolutely prodigious and Ministers are accountable for it but unable to call the organisations concerned to account. In part, Parliament is responsible. How often do we see amendments in this place to legislation requiring the publication of an annual report or creating some new body or group? I have no doubt that all these bodies are staffed by committed people trying their hardest to do the right thing, but they have taken on a life of their own and they are the front-line troops in the growing intrusiveness and growth of the power of the state.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08012455000379"></a>The Government promised in their response to the Select Committee eight years ago that a rigorous review of NDPBs will be undertaken every five years to establish whether the functions of the body are still required. It is a promise which has been broken. When can we expect the Government to act? They need to go further. Could the functions be carried out by the voluntary or private sector? Is it really necessary for the British Council&#151;I am sorry the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, is no longer in his place as he is the chairman and might have been able to help the Minister&#151;to be running education programmes which private firms could otherwise deliver at no cost to the taxpayer? Could some of the activities of some of these quangos be privatised? Is there scope for income generation, perhaps through Google advertising on their millions of website pages, as the excellent Dan Lewis of the Economic Research Council has suggested? I cannot understand why the BBC allows advertising on its web pages accessed from outside the UK but not on those accessed within the UK. Would it not be better to have the income and save the jobs of the news journalists currently under threat? Can quangos not be dispersed to the regions? Do they really need to be located in the most expensive parts of central London? I have quoted some astronomical costs of quangos but these annual costs are but a fraction of the long-term costs because many of the people employed are on Civil Service final salary pensions and conditions.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08012455000380"></a>I wonder also whether government agencies have been a success. I accept that we invented them when we were in power. They appeared to shrink the size of the Civil Service, but in fact we have seen a growth in the numbers employed and less accountability. Their role often leads to confusion about who is in charge and to outbreaks of buck-passing. Disastrous flooding or a serious lapse of prison security are examples of events which can leave a hapless Minister doing the rounds of TV studios in a no-win position.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08012455000535"></a>&#147;Maybe there does need to be a process, open to external inspection, by which public bodies acquire chairs and board members ...

</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000501"></a>He might have added, &#147;or at all&#148;. He argues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08012455000536"></a>&#147;If the Environment agency is carrying out agreed public policies then why does it need to be at arm&#146;s length from DEFRA? If it is meant to be independent, why is it so close, financially and managerially, to Whitehall? And, moreover, what is the point of worrying about who gets appointed to the board of a public body when there are no follow up procedures in place to see whether the board performs well?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000502"></a>The people who should be asking these questions are not <I>Guardian</I> journalists but the Ministers responsible. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s answers today. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

I shall concentrate my remarks on the role of charities. The third sector is very different from either government or local government bodies and commercial companies. Apart from their governance structure, they have the volunteering culture but can also develop unparalleled expertise and combine their services very flexibly. This is done by putting the child, the patient, the poor, the whatever, right at the centre of everything that they do and building the support around it&#151;if only all public services did that. It is also a very large sector; for example, it provides 80 per cent of all the palliative care in the UK.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08012455000383"></a>I consulted a number of charities in preparing for the debate, and this is what they said. Age Concern is concerned about short-term contracts from local authorities, which cause a lack of stability and an inability to plan properly. Terminating contracts at short notice also brings about uncertainty about redundancies. When money is tight, it is the council&#146;s own services that are protected, shifting the redundancy costs from the council to the charity. When you pay out for redundancy, that pot of money is lost to the public service pot, so planning to avoid redundancies anywhere is only good housekeeping. Age Concern is also concerned about the reluctance of commissioners to fund core costs. You need to make a bit over the top of cost to fund both overheads and unexpected problems that arise during the course of the contract.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08012455000384"></a>Another NGO said that the recent Compact agreement is great but is not used universally. Some government departments and local authorities are still tending towards one-year contracts. Will the Minister say how the Government are monitoring to see whether all authorities and departments are implementing it fully? The NGO was also concerned about the reluctance of commissioners to put a contingency into the contracts. When a problem arises, such as maternity leave, there is no money in the budget to cover it and the NGO has to go back and ask for more.</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08012455000385"></a>A third NGO was concerned about the process of bidding for contracts, which is often long-winded and behind schedule. That means that by the time you get the go-ahead, there are only a couple of weeks before the work is supposed to start. How can you manage your workforce, whether paid or volunteer, on that basis?</p>

<a name="80124-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08012455000386"></a>The RNID, which sent us a briefing for this debate, was concerned about four major issues, as the others were. There is a need for full-cost recovery, for an appropriate level of overhead, for an upfront discussion of the risks, and to make provision for them. It also wanted longer-term funding for greater stability. It also had another set of issues relating to campaigning, independence and accountability. It talked about its independence and wanted the ability to engage in campaigning, and not only as a peripheral activity. It wanted permission to broadcast social advocacy adverts and to repeal restrictions on demonstrations near Parliament, especially given the plans for the pedestrianisation of Parliament Square. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who brought in a Private Member&#146;s Bill on that issue, and I absolutely agree with the RNID. On accountability, the RNID would like to see impact reporting used more widely. This is where a charity sets out its objectives from last year, says how many of them have been achieved, and sets out its future objectives for next year.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08012455000387"></a>Sue Ryder, the provider of specialist palliative and neurological care, also sent us a briefing. It is at the forefront of innovation but has concerns about the financial arrangements that restrict its ability to innovate. It cites one-year contracts and no contracts at all as being of particular concern. It told us about the magnitude of the situation. Hospices, for example, receive only 34 per cent of their funding from statutory sources, so they alone are subsidising the Government, just for palliative care, to the tune of &#163;200 million per year&#151;an enormous amount of money. Underfunding means that services are being eroded. They also point out that a lack of transparency in the funding process means that services are funded differently by different PCTs, which is a major contributor to there being a postcode lottery for health. The NSPCC have the same concerns about short-term funding and shortfalls, but added that different accounting or planning cycles can disrupt plans and lead either to unidentified gaps in service, or unidentified overlaps, which are a waste of money.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08012455000388"></a>It is not easy to combine delivery of services with being an effective campaigning organisation, but it is desirable. The people who can alert us to need and bring about change are those closest to the grass roots. This issue of not covering full costs, and there being nothing for contingency and overheads, is serious. The public give money to charities on the understanding that it will be used to provide extra services, over and above what the Government are supposed to provide. If the cost of services is more than they get, charities will have to subsidise from their fundraising, and will therefore be able to do less of the extra stuff, which the public are paying for. The Government get a great multiplier when they use a charity to deliver services. They get it on the cheap because charities use volunteers. That is fine. I do not want to discourage the volunteering culture in any way, but it has to be taken account of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08012455000389"></a>NGOs can also provide savings by spreading their expertise over a wide area. By commissioning an NGO to deliver a service, the Government implicitly accept that they have a duty to deliver that service. They may say that if we ask them to pay charities more, they can commission less, so the missing services will have to be paid for by the charity. The charities do not always have the money to do that, so the total quantity of services will diminish, and so will innovation. Charities tell us that their ability to be creative and to innovate is being limited by the failure, financially, to allow for a bit of risk. There is always risk in doing new things. That is a pity, and we all lose by it. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply to all these concerns.</p>

I wish to offer some important perspectives from where the Church of England stands. For two years or more, Government Ministers have been in conversation with church leaders about the possibility of the church providing extensive welfare services, rather in the way that the church plays a major part in education. The new direction of the state, it seems, is to be a commissioning state, rather than one that has extensive institutions providing welfare.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08012455000391"></a>Both Government and church are well aware that in the Scandinavian countries and Germany the church provides extensive welfare services. These countries have a church tax, which is paid by most citizens. The money received through taxation is returned to the church in support of its ministers, its buildings and in making possible the extensive welfare work done in its name. I admit that I have sometimes wished that we had a church tax in the United Kingdom. Because welfare provision in these European countries is long-standing, the arrangements for financial provision offer financial security to the church and its welfare institutions. The church is treated as a partner, and its work is trusted, rather than controlled.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08012455000392"></a>The Church of England has very strong roots in local communities, making it well placed in many contexts to deliver quality services in a way that truly understands the local situation, which government departments may not. We very much want to be part of the discussion about the new opportunities that are opening up. We want to engage with the state in extending our considerable involvement in social care and community health provision. There is no single view in the church. In some quarters, present arrangements for partnership seem to work very well; in other areas, bishops and others have serious misgivings, based largely on their experience over some years of local projects in health and welfare, many of which the church has endeavoured to support or lead.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08012455000394"></a>The Archbishop&#146;s Council has commissioned serious research on what the Church of England&#146;s response to the commissioning state should be. It is being carried out for the church by the Von H1/4gel Institute, Cambridge. We are pleased to say that it is well supported by Members from both Houses, Ministers and shadow Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08012455000395"></a>On the main areas of our concern, my remarks echo points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. The first concern is best described as short-termism. Government-based funders will often fund a new project for only three years. As my Carlisle diocesan social responsibility officer put it to me, &#147;Staff can spend one year setting up, a second year doing serious work and a third year searching for funds. The prolonged uncertainty can lead to the loss of key staff members&#148;. As a way of delivery to meet social needs, that is inefficient and totally inadequate. </p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08012455000396"></a>There are better examples. The church is signing 25-year contracts for the new academies. Christian groups bidding to deliver dentistry are getting 20-year contracts. In all that, we are glad, but the picture is very mixed. Good social care needs long-term commitment, which we cannot emphasise too strongly. The heart of this debate is about the quality of delivery, not about the number of initiatives. Our second concern is goalposts and the tendency for them to be continually shifted. To quote my social responsibility officer again, &#147;The Cumbria local area agreement was launched in April 2007 and was intended to last for three years. Government policy has changed with the publication of the local government and public health Bill. There is now a new single set of 198 measures representing national priorities known as the national indicator set and the only measures on which central government would access outcomes. Cumbria is now required to deliver a new local area agreement effective from 1st April 2008&#148;. The shifting of goal posts represents a serious deficiency in solid, proven, long-term strategy.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08012455000397"></a>Funding is the third area of concern. The church&#146;s diocesan boards of education are statutory bodies with their own financial structures and reserves, so they are reasonably secure, but that is not so for social responsibility. New church institutions would have to be created either at a diocesan level or a national level if the church is to become a major welfare provider. It cannot be prudent to do this if the continuity of funding is liable to be insecure.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08012455000398"></a>The Bishop for Urban Life and Faith, the right reverend Stephen Lowe, has been to look at Anglican church projects in Australia and Hong Kong, and the arrangements for funding are quite different from how things look here. That is central to the debate which needs to be held. If the church is to be a partner, it must be trusted by government and not controlled. As I perceive it, recent governments have found that very difficult. Church projects of course would be audited, but not controlled. My opinion is that, recently, we have been building a society that is very low on trust and very high on inspection and control&#151;I see that, for example, in farming&#151;which is very bad news for a healthy society.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08012455000399"></a>The fourth area of concern, and in many ways the most fundamental, is the possibility of a clash of views in the spheres of justice and ethical values, and the implications that this would have if the church was the recipient of large sums of taxpayers&#146; money for the provision of welfare. The church sees part of its role as challenging existing assumptions and

We must be about advocacy as well as about delivery.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08012455000400"></a>In spite of huge areas of agreement on the welfare of our citizens, it is increasingly possible that differences could lead us into significant difficulty over, for example, protection for the poor or policies which challenge the Christian understanding of marriage. If the church chose to challenge certain policies and the values undergirding them, it could have government funding denied. Then it could be trapped in the unenviable position of making its staff insecure or having to go along with a policy which compromised the position required by its faith.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08012455000401"></a>In conclusion, these are interesting and challenging times for the church. The nation is changing from a welfare state to more of a welfare society. The church very much wishes to be part of the discussion, but it also has serious concerns and misgivings, which need to be discussed frankly and addressed. It needs to be treated as a long-term partner which is trusted even when it wants to challenge the current effectiveness of delivery.</p>

In the six short minutes available to each us, I want to share some of the experience of the UK voluntary bodies that the Government rely on to deliver their policies for the nation&#146;s housing.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08012455000403"></a>The not-for-profit housing associations have become the principal agencies through which the Government&#146;s plans for affordable housing and the neighbourhood services that go with this activity are fulfilled. Council housing is no longer the mechanism for building new homes for those unable to afford what they need on the open market. Today it is the range of non-governmental bodies&#151;mostly charitable housing associations&#151;that add each year to the stock of affordable homes&#151;so-called social housing. These NGOs have taken on the ownership and management of a million properties previously owned by local authorities. Each of these non-profit, non-governmental housing organisations is an independent body with an autonomous board to govern its affairs. I declare my interest as chair of one of them, the Hanover Housing Association.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08012455000404"></a>Others in this debate are underlining the value of charitable, voluntary and community bodies being genuinely separate from and independent of central government. I heartily and emphatically agree with these arguments and will confine my own comments to commending the work of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in its negotiations with Government over the compact between the two parties. I wish the new Compact Commissioner well in the intermediary role when he or she is appointed.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08012455000405"></a>The voluntary housing association sector represents an interesting case study. After 30 years of regulation and subjection to government edicts, have these NGOs now become creatures of the state? Is there now a master/servant relationship? Have the once-independent housing bodies, which have a proud history dating  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_405"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>back to the Middle Ages, been captured by the state? Having taken the King&#146;s shilling, have they become part of a contract culture, doing the Government&#146;s bidding in return for payments? I would argue that the housing associations have not yet lost their independence of spirit or action. Housing associations are competitive and innovative, and each is different&#151;working with local communities and specific groups in exciting and important ways. But there is a need to remain constantly vigilant against erosion of this independence.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08012455000406"></a>The new Housing and Regeneration Bill currently in Committee in the other place poses new threats. This Bill introduces a new regulator for housing associations. In most respects the power of this regulator mirrors that of the Housing Corporation, whose place it will take. However, in important ways the Bill gives central government new powers which I fear cross the invisible line and subtly change the relationship between the state and these voluntary bodies, the housing associations. On the one hand, powers are given to the regulator to establish standards that cover all and every aspect of each housing association&#146;s behaviour and to enforce these standards even where there is no question of malpractice or misconduct. &#147;Standards&#148; could embrace the widest range of activities; for example, requiring adoption of any new initiative from central government, as at present with ideas for the Government&#146;s respect agenda for combating anti-social behaviour in the neighbourhoods where housing associations are at work. On the other hand, as well as extending the regulator&#146;s role, the Bill introduces the power of the Secretary of State to direct the regulator as to the standards it should specify and the details of those standards. This chain of command from the Secretary of State to the regulator and thence to the NGO, the housing association, will no doubt be used sparingly and sensitively by the current Ministers who, I know, have the very best of intentions. But the new Bill sets out a line of control which could be seen to enslave the housing associations if a future Secretary of State was so minded.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08012455000407"></a>Perhaps the experience of the voluntary and often charitable housing associations will find echoes in other parts of the voluntary sector represented in this debate. In all cases, the relevant charities and the associations and federations, such as the NCVO and, in the case of housing, the National Housing Federation, need to monitor incoming legislation, blow the whistle when central government cross a line in the potential erosion of the organisation&#146;s independence and, perhaps, look to your Lordships&#146; House to remove such hazards. One such piece of legislation is now in the wings, and I am grateful for the opportunity to alert the House to the possible need for amending action when the Housing and Regeneration Bill reaches us later this year.</p>

That said, I can also say&#151;and wish to say with appreciation&#151;that as constituency Member for Orkney and Shetland for 18 years, I found the noble Lord one of the best Ministers to deal with when it came to understanding constituency problems and attempting to address them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08012455000409"></a>When I left Westminster I regularly answered the question, &#147;Do you miss it?&#148; with the response, &#147;It&#146;s people I miss&#148;. One of the real pleasures of being here in your Lordships&#146; House is in re-establishing old friendships and acquaintanceships as well as making new ones. I have very much valued the warmth of the welcome that I have received and appreciate the genuinely friendly ambience of the House, its Members and not least the staff who, in addition to their friendly demeanour, could not have been more helpful in helping a new boy learn the ropes.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08012455000410"></a>I received a particularly warm welcome from two Scottish Members of your Lordships&#146; House, who explained that my arrival meant that they would almost certainly no longer be in any danger of topping the annual travel expenses table.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08012455000411"></a>I have the most northerly residence of any Peer in the United Kingdom. Indeed, my title reflects the Tankerness home where I have lived with my family for more than 24 years. I had the great privilege to represent the people of Orkney and Shetland in another place for 18 years, and to represent my adopted home of Orkney in the Scottish Parliament for eight years. They are very distinctive island communities, proud of their heritage, but ever ready to embrace new challenges. While much legislation affecting the isles now originates in the Scottish Parliament, I hope that from time to time it will be appropriate for me to bring a very northern perspective to your Lordships&#146; deliberations.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08012455000412"></a>A key reason for wishing to take part in this debate is that two issues in which I have taken a keen interest, in the other place and in the Scottish Parliament, are freedom of information and human rights legislation. Both subjects have topical relevance to the accountability of non-governmental organisations providing public services. Next week, the Ministry of Justice&#146;s consultation on the designation of additional public authorities under Section 5 of the Freedom of Information Act closes. I very much welcome the general approach of the consultation, which starts from the Government&#146;s belief that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000550"></a>&#147;there are good reasons for reviewing coverage of the Act&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80124-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08012455000413"></a>Many organisations receive large amounts of taxpayers&#146; money to carry out functions of a public nature, but are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as public authorities to which the Act already applies.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08012455000414"></a>Prima facie there is a very strong case for extending the coverage of the Act. However, having been responsible for taking the Scottish freedom of information legislation through the Scottish Parliament, with a similar Section 5 provision, I am well aware that this is not as straightforward as it may seem. As articulated in the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_407"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consultation paper, there is a balance to be struck between the public interest and whether the burden is proportionate. The noble Lord, Lord Best, reminded us of the importance of housing associations in the delivery of services for the public service, yet we have a great breadth between very small and very large housing associations, which may have to cope in very different ways if freedom of information is extended. But believing that freedom of information is to be celebrated as a contribution to better governance, rather than a burden to be tholed, my preference is for the option that proposes a progressive widening of coverage. I recognise that any decision to extend coverage will require further, more specific, consultation, but I hope that that consultation does not become an excuse for unreasonable delay.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08012455000415"></a>The issue that I want to raise concerns the Human Rights Act 1998 and follows the decision of the House of Lords, sitting in a judicial capacity, in the case of YL v Birmingham City Council, that private care homes, even when publicly funded, are not carrying out public functions and as a result an individual could not sue those care homes for an alleged breach of convention rights. Even before the YL decision, the Joint Committee on Human Rights had raised concerns about the inconsistent judicial interpretation of public authority. That matter was promptly raised in your Lordships' House by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, on 27 June, when she asked how the Government sought to protect the human rights of vulnerable people in care homes in the light of that decision. The reply from the now Leader of the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, was encouraging; and in fairness the Government have expressed disappointment at the judicial decision.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08012455000416"></a>Notwithstanding that, and assurances given after the decision, there is a continuing concern about the position of private care home residents. There have been suggestions that this issue is best left to a Bill of Rights at some unspecified date, but that is less than satisfactory. Using the Health and Social Care Act to strengthen the regulatory framework may help, but I note that the Equality and Human Rights Commission has questioned the effectiveness of such an approach. Individuals will still not be able to enforce convention rights against private care homes; the proposal will not directly affect the scope of the Human Rights Act to cover care homes; and the new Care Quality Commission will have no power to investigate complaints from individual residents and provide them with remedies. I ask the noble Minister to respond to these concerns when he winds up. Each of these topics could command a short debate in its own right and I suspect we shall return to them.</p>

He also played a part in the development of the Scottish Parliament as a member of the steering group leading to its establishment, and he served the Parliament with great distinction as its Deputy First Minister, as well as holding other ministerial offices. I know that we shall hear from him many times in future, as he gives us the benefit of his experience and wide-ranging interests, and we look forward to that. On a personal note, I am to pay my first visit to Orkney this summer and I hope to consult him about my itinerary. I understand that the lochs, and the views from Tankerness, are not to be missed. The noble Lord&#146;s future contributions to this House are likewise not to be missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08012455000418"></a>I, too, want to concentrate on the charitable sector, because that is what I understand &#147;NGO&#148; to mean. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for securing this short debate. As somebody who has also spent a long time working with NDPBs, I should perhaps remind him that appointing processes have long been rigorous, open and well prescribed. I know from personal experience that people who work for NDPBs are closely appraised and rigorously monitored.</p>

<a name="80124-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08012455000419"></a>Anxieties expressed by noble Lords about non-governmental organisations delivering services should be taken seriously, but we must keep a sense of proportion. The vast majority of charities are small, with annual incomes of under &#163;10,000, and do not go anywhere near the delivery of public services, concentrating on helping their client groups. It is only among the bigger charities&#151;those with incomes of more than &#163;500,000 a year&#151;that you find any major involvement in public service delivery, and even then only 60 per cent are major service deliverers. None of this is new. Arguments about short-term contracts, full cost recovery, mission creep, subsidisation and additionality have been around for as long as I can remember&#151;and that, I am afraid, is a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08012455000420"></a>Many charities decide that they will only be campaigning charities and will not go in for service provision. That is a decision that we took when I led the carers movement. However, others take a different view, and for good reasons. Why should we want to get NGOs involved in service provision at all? It is not just because those services are cheaper, although they often are, as noble Lords have pointed out. The best public services are those that are based and have their origins in the needs of the user. No one knows that better than the charitable sector, as the noble Baroness opposite reminded us. Groups that work on the front line, in close touch with disadvantaged groups and individuals whom they represent, know what kind of services best suit their needs. They know what works and what does not. Their creativity, their innovation and their ability to build trust in their client groups have driven improvements in public services. The whole user-involvement, personalisation agenda that is nowadays seen as so vital to the provision of public services has been led by NGOs. That is a great tribute to the work of the third sector.

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08012455000421"></a>In order to make best use of this quality, a new partnership is essential between public and voluntary services. The energy, creativity, commitment and experience of NGOs must be properly recognised and harnessed, as well as constantly monitored, if we are not to fall into the traps that some noble Lords have set out.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08012455000422"></a>I would be the last to claim that the difficulties in this area have all been solved. However, we cannot fail to recognise how much more attention and care the third sector receives from this Government than it has ever known before. I well remember the frustration of working with previous Governments, when you might wait weeks or even months for a meeting with a Minister or officials, and when you got there you might be patronised or even treated with contempt; you were rarely taken seriously. Now it is difficult to keep track of the number of initiatives that are aimed at making the third sector an equal and effective partner in the provision of services.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08012455000423"></a>By any dispassionate measure, this Government have a proud record of co-operation with and respect for the charitable sector. The sector&#146;s representative organisations, such as NCVO and ACEVO, together with many others, have a fine record, too, in ensuring that such co-operation is effective and always developing, so that, when NGOs now sit round a table with government, they have a much more powerful voice. The development of the compact, and now Compact Plus, has also helped. It may not be perfect, but it helps to ensure that contracts are properly negotiated and managed and that they are sustainably funded. We now have an Office of the Third Sector, a Minister for the Third Sector and an action plan for third sector involvement. These initiatives are well monitored and evaluated.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08012455000424"></a>I would like to highlight two areas that have a great impact on the delivery of public services: commissioning and capacity building. The world in which public services are being delivered is changing and many of those who want to commission services from the third sector need to develop their skills, expertise and understanding of the sector. The National Programme for Third Sector Commissioning aims to do just that. I am sure that the training programme currently under way, which includes training not just for commissioners but also for elected members, will have a profound effect, not least on the sector&#146;s bidding capacity.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08012455000425"></a>All my life, I have been sitting round tables talking about the need to develop capacity in the third sector. Through the ChangeUp programme and the establishment of the Capacitybuilders organisation in 2006, we are now finally doing that. Especially welcome are the Capacitybuilders funding programmes that target rural, black and minority ethnic communities. I have also been involved with the Futurebuilders initiative, an investment programme for third sector organisations that want to deliver public services; the initiative has loans, grants and capacity-building programmes. In a recent round of visits to funded projects, my fellow panel members and I have been inspired by the innovative work that is being carried out.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08012455000426"></a>When it comes to the third sector, I am and always have been a glass-more-than-half-full person. In spite of the gloomy scenario that we hear about in some  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_410"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>areas, I want to conclude on an optimistic note. The Government&#146;s commitment to the third sector extends far beyond their desire to see it as a partner in the provision of public services. It is important that the third sector should also be involved in the development of policy and, of course, fulfil its long-established role as a campaigner on behalf of disadvantaged groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08012455000428"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth has today given us the opportunity to discuss the burgeoning number of quangos with their increasing costs. There are many concerns. Local democracy is being crushed by the explosion of quangos, with nine unelected regional assemblies imposed throughout the country, including the north-east in spite of the 78 per cent &#147;no&#148; vote to a North-East Regional Assembly in 2004.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08012455000429"></a>They have vast budgets&#151;&#163;400 million for the London Development Agency alone, under the control of Ken Livingstone, where fraudulent funding of various organisations is now the subject of police inquiries. Why does the regional development in Northern Ireland have offices in 12 foreign cities? The Minister may not have the answer tonight, but can the Government let me know the figures for running these offices compared with the funds that they bring in on an annual basis?</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08012455000430"></a>Can the Government deny that there is an emerging pattern between the growing role for quangos, the taxpayer forced to fund them and their declining accountability&#151;which is extremely important&#151;in the accessibility of information?</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08012455000431"></a>The Sector Skills Development Agency has 25 sub-quangos, with their own websites, branding and staff premises. Do these not constitute an unfair tax-funded threat to private sector providers? Also, local quangos are wholly or largely self-appointing and very few are subject to ministerial or departmental oversight. Why should flood defences not be the responsibility of local authorities? The Milk Development Council, in 1997, had four officials. It now has 44 staff and spends &#163;700 million taken from dairy farmers plus &#163;5 from you and me. How many quangos have been closed down? There are now 94 different organisations and officials inspecting hospitals. The story grows. On the Olympics, why are there so many departments and agencies that cost &#163;170 billion, which is five times the defence budget? The mind boggles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08012455000432"></a>On another note, I appreciate that we all want a cleaner environment, but the duplication of the Countryside Agency, Natural England and the Environment Agency creates higher costs, with separate websites, stationery and separate premises.

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08012455000433"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth mentioned Dan Lewis who, over a number of years, has made an in-depth study of quangos, which I have also studied. The list is endless. No doubt I have repeated some of what other speakers have already mentioned, but I feel very strongly that many quangos could be consigned to the dustbin, as I believe Mr Blair promised years ago. No matter who made that promise, perhaps it could now be carried out.</p>

The subject is potentially so wide-ranging that I did not know before the debate what angle the noble Lord might approach it from. In the event, it was even more wide-ranging than I had suspected. Like other noble Lords, I was expecting a debate on NGOs, but instead we got quangos. Never mind. At its widest, the debate potentially raises issues about the boundary between the state and civil society, which is something that would be good to have a debate about some time or other. That boundary is increasingly under pressure with changes in pension provision, student funding and healthcare provision, and now we are imminently expecting a Green Paper on social care, which will test the boundary still further. I was proceeding from the assumption that the state was in the process of shrinking in relation to the individual, but the noble Lord has put a valuable extra slant on that by indicating that there are respects in which it is at the same time encroaching on civil society. These issues have theoretical ramifications that are too wide to be traversed in six minutes, so I shall stick to more mundane and practical matters.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08012455000435"></a>A year ago, the Public Administration Select Committee launched an inquiry into commissioning public services from the third sector. It has taken evidence from a wide range of individuals and organisations and we eagerly await the final report. While it is true that since 1997 the Government have increasingly emphasised the role of the third sector in developing and delivering better public services, it is unclear how far this process has actually gone. In all likelihood the volume of work undertaken by the third sector is much smaller than the rhetoric would lead us to believe. Does this matter? Do we want to see significantly more public services being delivered by voluntary and community groups? The answer to this question is complex and dependent on a whole range of additional questions to which the Select Committee is seeking answers. For example, have services taken over by third sector organisations shown improvements in quality? Are they more popular with those who use them? Is there a loss of accountability with contractual arrangements replacing direct political accountability? Is there evidence that the third sector is more likely to innovate in its delivery of public services?</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08012455000436"></a>There are no easy answers and often the evidence base is thin, but a number of distinctive roles can be identified where the third or voluntary sector is uniquely qualified to make a contribution. NGOs have a unique store of knowledge that enables them to identify and speak with authority about the problems of those with whom they work. They also often have unique insight into the solutions. A clear example is training for employment. In the field of visual impairment&#151;noble Lords will understand my drawing examples from the field I know best, and I declare my interest up front as chairman of RNIB&#151;state agencies have traditionally shown their lack of understanding both of blind people&#146;s abilities and how to realise them. One can predict that the same might very well turn out to be the case with  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_412"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the generic private sector organisations to which these responsibilities are beginning to be subcontracted.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08012455000437"></a>Other examples might include technology and how to make the street environment safer. The state should purchase this expertise through central and local government and the utilities rather than, at best, persisting with dead-hand solutions that do not work. Where NGOs have demonstrated that they have the answers they should be funded by the state to deliver them. When I say &#147;funded&#148;, like other noble Lords I mean funded in full. Contracting to the third sector should not mean service on the cheap. Quality services need to be paid for. In some fields solutions are either unknown as yet or only very partially understood. Research is needed to find what works. This is a major raison d&#146;tre of the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08012455000438"></a>For the rest of my time I should like to focus on innovation&#151;new ways of tackling old problems. Traditionally the third sector has been able to innovate by using unrestricted charitable funds, trying new approaches and, where they can be shown to work, seeking to roll them out more widely. An example of this is the integrated low vision service covering Camden and Islington which the RNIB has developed together with the two social services departments and the local primary care trust. This provides a high-quality person-centred service to people with sight loss. It is truly innovative. However, despite the evidence of success, it has proved extremely difficult to get this model adopted in other parts of the country. The third sector can be innovative, but narrow and restrictive public sector commissioning policies can easily stifle this creativity. That is why the recent contribution to this debate from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Andy Burnham MP, is so welcome. He appeals to the commissioners of local services to innovate and break traditional patterns of local spending, to be more entrepreneurial and move money around if traditional areas of spending are not producing the goods, to be open-minded about who might be best placed to provide services and trust the voluntary sector as a partner, and to trust people to know what services best suit their needs.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08012455000439"></a>Another way in which the third sector can make an innovative contribution to public services is in the development of policy and strategy. This does not have to be undertaken largely or exclusively by government through the traditional report/Green Paper/White Paper/legislation route. As the recent development of a UK vision strategy shows, the process could be much more inclusive. The draft strategy, led by the RNIB on behalf of the Vision 2020 UK coalition, with the support of Guide Dogs, Action for Blind People and the National Association of Local Societies for Visually Impaired People, was developed between April and November 2007, with input from national and local voluntary organisations, professional groups and central and local government. Consultation on the draft took place through to January 2008 and included a series of regional and country-based consultation events. We held a most successful event here at the House of Lords last week to celebrate what a success the whole thing had been. The comments from that process are currently being collated and reviewed, and the final strategy will be launched in April 2008. That is surely a far better way to develop strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08012455000440"></a>NGOs are not just service providers, research centres and think tanks. They have a crucial role to play in giving a voice to less visible sections of our society that typically lack a voice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08012455000443"></a>In this connection I should like to comment on the view that an increased involvement in public service delivery inevitably threatens the sector&#146;s independence and ability to campaign, or that delivering public services and remaining an independent campaigning voice must always be in conflict with one another. It is not clear to me why such a tension should exist.</p>

He and I were colleagues and friends in another place and neighbours in next-door constituencies. I wryly observe that there has already been a somewhat northerly slant on Scottish affairs in this House, but I shall welcome his championing of such issues in the future.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08012455000445"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, is to be congratulated on raising the issue and beginning a debate that has ranged very widely indeed. It would be appropriate to express some understanding if the Minister found it impossible to deal fully in his remarks with the topics raised in the debate. I welcome the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, which was core to his message about the multiplication of quangos and the questions he asked about the diminution in the availability of information about those that exist. There is a need for a central point where information can be drawn down by those seeking to oversee their activities; the department-by-department quest is not always as fruitful as it might be.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08012455000446"></a>That gives rise to the question of the suitability of our parliamentary oversight arrangements for these non-governmental organisations. The Public Administration Select Committee is doing a remarkable job in another place in bringing together the great issues, some of which have been touched on in this debate. I am not certain that we need another agency or oversight body for that purpose. Most of the departmental Select Committees look very closely at the activities of non-governmental organisations and it would be wrong to leave the impression that parliamentary oversight is not continuous and deeply probing.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08012455000447"></a>The inquiry that the Public Administration Select Committee is conducting into the buying or commissioning of services from charitable and voluntary organisations for the public service is profoundly important. As the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, said, its report is awaited with eager anticipation. It is fair to say, as the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_414"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said, that no Government have given as much attention to the third sector as the present one, and the existence of a unit within the Cabinet Office devoted to this subject and a Cabinet Minister regularly speaking out about it is very much to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08012455000448"></a>I take the point made earlier that the importance of the third sector in the delivery of public services is not to be exaggerated and is not to be seen as a substitution for the obligation of government and the public sector to provide those services. The statistic was revealed in a recent speech by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in another place that only 2 per cent of National Health Service public expenditure is spent on such bodies. That could, if left alone, give a misleading impression of its importance. As my noble friend Lady Walmsley pointed out, palliative care in this country is largely provided by that sector.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08012455000449"></a>I have two concluding points. One is that if we are going to have proper scrutiny and oversight of third-sector providers of services, it is important to have better standardisation of the contracts that they operate. Our noble friend Lord Adebowale made that point in evidence to the Public Administration Select Committee and we should take it seriously.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08012455000450"></a>My second point is about complaints. Nearly all third sector organisations ought to provide proper complaints procedures and mechanisms to deal with user complaints. It is surprising that the Charity Commission survey conducted last year found that 69 per cent of charities did not have complaints procedures at all, with 40 per cent of them providing public services. The independent complaints reviewer for the Charity Commission gave that evidence to the Public Administration Select Committee. He said that in this growing sector of public service provision the citizen remains unprotected by redress mechanisms other than the court. That is a matter to be addressed.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08012455000451"></a>In conclusion, I am grateful that Ed Miliband, the Minister responsible, has strongly recognised the importance of the independence of these organisations not being put at risk by being contracted to deliver services. More important than the services that those bodies provide is influencing public opinion about the quality of service that could be provided and their immediate understanding of issues that are not often understood by some of the public sector, or even private sector providers, but which greatly enhance the scope and effectiveness of public service provision.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_415"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisations or non-departmental public bodies. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle, among others, have also taken the opportunity to widen the debate to other NGOs. The noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, referred to the fact that NGO means different things to different people. I would very much have liked to deal with issues involving, for instance, contracting with government for the provision of services by charities. I have great sympathy with the argument, for example, that the promise of full cost recovery has, as the National Audit Office has reported, simply been broken. The right reverend Prelate referred to concerns over short-termism, shifting of goalposts, inconsistency over funding and concerns over trusts, among other things.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08012455000455"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, talked specifically of his experience in the housing association sector. The noble Lord, Lord Low, too, raised some important questions, but in view of the constraints I doubt that I shall be able to spend more time on this area, and I apologise to those noble Lords because, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, these are very important subjects worthy of their own debates.</p>

<a name="80124-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08012455000456"></a>Following my noble friend&#146;s lead, I shall focus my arguments on quangos. The new Labour Government&#146;s definition of a non-departmental public body in 1997 in a Cabinet Office publication <I>Public Bodies</I> was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08012455000537"></a>&#147;A body which has a role in the processes of national government, but is not a government department, or part of one, and which accordingly operates to a greater or lesser extent at arm&#146;s length from Ministers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08012455000457"></a>The paradox is, of course, that the more you encourage them to operate at arm&#146;s length from Ministers the less accountable to Parliament they become. A cynic might say that that is sometimes the intention: if a policy is unpopular, or there is a failure in delivery, make sure there is a quango to blame it on. Likewise when a quango with geographically focused objectives is established by national government, it is almost by definition unaccountable to the local communities with which it operates. The regional development agencies are a classic example, and the problem is about to get worse. Ministers talk about strengthening the role of local communities in the planning process, yet they are proposing to transfer important housing and planning powers to the completely unaccountable RDAs. The noble Lord, Lord Best, also talked about housing and referred to different concerns regarding forthcoming legislation, which is likely to centralise power over housing associations.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08012455000458"></a>A major criticism of quangos is that unelected officials have responsibility for performing central and local authority functions, without, as my noble friend Lady Sharples said, full accountability to elected politicians. Critics believe that quangos are insulated to a greater or lesser degree from direct ministerial involvement, weaken the scrutiny mechanisms of Parliament and remove control and responsibility at local level. Criticism has also been made of their escalating cost.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08012455000503"></a>However, before I deal with that, I would like to highlight the difficulty in identifying the number of NDPBs&#151;or quangos&#151;in existence. A sleight of hand has been at work in the Cabinet Office figures, by, for  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_416"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, removing from the list, after devolution, those for which responsibility has been devolved to Scotland and Wales. The totals, for 1997, of 1,128 and for 2007, of 883, are, quite simply, apples and pears. There has been so much criticism that the Cabinet Office has dropped its database and become increasingly reluctant to provide any figures or information.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08012455000459"></a>Furthermore, even if there has been a reduction in the number, it has been achieved through amalgamation and reclassification&#151;as well as by discounting those for whom responsibility has been devolved&#151;and should not be seen as indication of a decline in their role or significance. That the very opposite is true is shown so clearly by the fact that NDPB expenditure of colossal and rising inexorably.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08012455000460"></a>According to a recent report, quoted by my noble friend, from the Economic Research Council, which has aggregated the costs of the 883 public bodies in the Cabinet Office&#146;s 2006 report, total annual spending on those public bodies was &#163;174 billion. Removing the NHS quangos, the total is still over &#163;40 billion.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08012455000461"></a>Since 1997, this Labour Government have pursed an agenda of what they call partnership, which has prompted the increased deployment or creation of quangos, as a means of instituting new public policy initiatives. Yet speaking in 1995, as my noble friend Lady Sharples said, Tony Blair had promised to,</p>
<ul><a name="08012455000551"></a>&#147;sweep away the quango state&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000504"></a>if Labour were elected at the next general election. As my noble friend Lord Forsyth pointed out, none other than Gordon Brown also said then:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08012455000538"></a>&#147;The biggest question ... is ... why there is not more openness and accountability ... The real alternative is a bonfire of the quangos and greater democracy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012455000505"></a>What humbug!</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08012455000462"></a>As long ago as 2003, the Public Administration Select Committee, to which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, also referred in such positive terms, concluded that there was a basic lack of information about which bodies exist and their roles and powers; that the Cabinet Office publication <I>Public Bodies</I><I>,</I> did not include all bodies and was commonly subject to errors and admissions and that public mistrust in the quango state remained.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08012455000463"></a>In conclusion, no reasonable person would, I dare suggest, say that there is never a role for any quangos. However, the extent of their use and purpose, their lack of accountability, independence or supervision and, importantly, their complete dislocation from the local communities that they serve as well as of their cost have, as my noble friend said, got completely out of control.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08012455000464"></a>Messrs Blair and Brown both demanded a bonfire of quangos and now claim that there are fewer of them. Since Labour came to power, the amount of public money spent on quangos has soared out of control, from &#163;24 billion to &#163;170 billion per year. The Government&#146;s reliance on commissions, taskforces and quangos raises serious questions about accountability, democracy, independence, scrutiny and public trust in the way that this country is governed.</p>

I am replying to a debate in which, fairly typically, the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, produced a magnificent firework display in his opening contribution. The problem with fireworks is that they can be experienced in two ways. The first is the enormous explosion&#151;that was discussed by all those who followed the noble Lord&#151;but there second is through their glittering stars; that approach appears in all the contributions that examined the role of the third sector and NGOs in advancing welfare in our society and improving the delivery of government services.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08012455000466"></a>I will addresses myself to the bang in a moment&#151;and will not sell the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, short&#151;but will deal with the stars first. The first star was the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who hoped that this debate would be largely about the third sector and charities. She wanted to clearly identify where we could improve the Government&#146;s relationship with charities and the success of the service they provide, while not compromising their many essential functions which are well beyond any concern of government. She was followed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle who emphasised that, as far as the church was concerned, this different and independent role must be preserved. It is bound to be preserved and appreciated. At the same time, the church has a role to play within the delivery framework of some services.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08012455000467"></a>I emphasise that we take the criticisms voiced in the debate seriously. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, identified them first. There is a problem with contracting. The noble Baroness is right: short-term contracting puts any organisation under pressure, and charities often do not have the resources to cope with some of these challenges as easily as other bodies. Of course, charities are entitled to include the full costs in bidding for services, and we are concerned to train and develop those involved in the third sector so that the kind of issues that she&#151;and the right reverend Prelate, in terms of the church&#146;s role&#151;identified should be addressed. In developing an intensely fruitful new government approach, we should make sure of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08012455000468"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, did not comment on charities, but he will have recognised that other Lords have taken the opportunity of his debate to emphasise that how certain services are delivered is changing because of the nature of our society: the move from the welfare state to the welfare society. That is an extremely graphic illustration of the fact that people relate to the necessary support they receive, underpinned by the state, in rather different ways if it can be provided by organisations in which they have trust and with which they relate closely. Charities fulfil this role in extensive ways. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for identifying the crucial role of the charities in which he is involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08012455000469"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, identified some of the most crucial aspects of the third sector: the housing associations. We know of his great expertise in the housing sector. I fear that what I received from him today was a trail of his contribution to the legislation  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_418"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 418</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when it appears in the House. He will forgive me if I duck the responsibility of replying to him in any detail on how the Bill will be handled and respond to the challenges he presents.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08012455000470"></a>Of course, in circumstances identified by the noble Lord, the old mechanisms in which social housing had been provided&#151;with resources for local authorities to provide local council housing&#151;have been transformed in recent decades into a new form of delivery and service. That requires crucial issues of accountability to be taken into account. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will have something to say about the potentially overweening power of those appointed to be accountable for public money in this area. Others will have the chance to respond to that in due course.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08012455000471"></a>I was delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, chose this debate for his maiden speech. I am also delighted at his arrival here. The old canard for those of us who returned to the Pennines was that all the Scots got home a good deal faster because they got aircraft to Glasgow or Edinburgh, or fast trains to Aberdeen, while we struggled to get back to our areas. </p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08012477000003"></a>I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that I had enough trouble with the broad texture of this debate, and the rather specific questions he introduced are a real problem for me to respond to. I can say only that the Government are concerned about the judgment with regard to the Human Rights Act and private care, and we are examining the position. The Government are wrestling with the problem of the Freedom of Information Act as it stands. Those challenges are still to be responded to. I appreciate that he sees merit in extending the Act further. I cannot promise an early and immediate response to that, but he has registered the fact that he will be campaigning strongly on it. We are therefore duly warned of the contribution that he will make.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08012477000004"></a>I was, of course, enormously grateful to my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley for her contribution. The House recognises her expertise in this area. She was able to demonstrate the extent to which the Government, in shifting ranges of services to be delivered through the sector, have set out to wrestle with the significant problems of dealing with charities differently from other agencies&#151;a point that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, also emphasised. We have made substantial commitments. The Cabinet Office has a Minister for the third sector. That provides accountability but it also means that at ministerial level we have responsibility for effective liaison with the third sector and with charities, and that is a base on which we can work for the future.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08012477000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, introduced this debate in his usual challenging way. What about the issues that he raised and the problems of the quangos? He asked where the promised bonfire of the quangos is. He will have heard the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, indicating that he thought that the Government are shifting their criteria somewhat&#151;and he was not including devolved Assembly quangos in the criteria&#151;but nevertheless, somewhat grudgingly, recognising that the Government are able to point to the fact that far from mushrooming, quangos are under control. Since 1997, they have fallen in numbers. The noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_419"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Forsyth, said that people cannot find out about these bodies and that doing so defies the wit of man. If it defies his wit, it would certainly defy the wit of many other people. Let me assure him that the Cabinet Office will shortly publish figures for 2007 that will show a further reduction in numbers. The Cabinet Office will shortly publish a report that covers quangos and their role in government. It may not be as extensive as some reports in the past, but it will contain information on the size, spend and membership of the quango sector, so that will save the noble Lord some searching on the website for elements of his research.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08012477000006"></a>I think that the noble Lord was perhaps stressing the point too strongly, but it is the case that we expect quangos to be responsible. It is necessary that they are subject to regular and rigorous review. The noble Lord touched a rich vein of support with the Government when he lamented the fact that almost every Bill that goes through the House has an amendment about the annual report. I hasten to add that it is generally tabled by the Official Opposition, and we all wonder what its value might be.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08012477000007"></a>I chaired a government quango for a while. We were well aware, as the noble Lord rightly said, that our circulation list included a large number of people whose filing cabinet for our report was a proverbial wastepaper basket. It was quite difficult, however, to suggest to people that they were being careless about the hard work you had done. I can talk about it freely now because it was the Further Education Funding Council, one of the bodies the noble Baroness, Lady Sharples, referred to, which has disappeared and now comes within the framework of the Learning and Skills Council, but that body appreciated the fact that all real stakeholders who took an interest in its work read this report and responded to it in a fairly rigorous way. So the question of the publication of official reports is not all a bonfire of the vanities. I would not for one moment want to dissuade quangos from publishing reports which are necessary for their openness and accountability. If others do not read them as extensively as they might, it is a salutary exercise for those who are consuming public resources and responsible for public resources, as quangos are, to compile a report which is defensible in terms of public scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08012477000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharples, asked about the pay for quangocrats, as she called them&#151;people who serve on quangos. This is a matter for individual departments but she will know that a very large number of people who serve on quangos are unpaid. Many people serve quite unpaid on the boards of advisory bodies and across the United Kingdom thousands of men and women serve voluntarily on such bodies. I do not think all the issues which have arisen about excessive pay in the public sector are addressed specifically to quangos. There are one or two key government bodies which have had to adjust to the market rate. The Government have often pitched it at one level and not had enough takers. They have been obliged to increase the rate of pay in order to get somebody to fill the role.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08012477000009"></a>This has been a fascinating debate and an extremely difficult one to respond to with any degree of coherence, but the themes that come through are clear. The noble  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_420"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Forsyth, led the way by saying that it is enormously important that quangos and those who use public resources are accountable. He had a certain degree of reply to that. With a government department now concerned directly with these areas, certain aspects are becoming more explicit. I hope I take the House with me on this, but there is not doubt that Select Committees in the other place&#151;I will say nothing about our own committees&#151;have grown in competence over the years and exert a great deal more pressure on government and have heads of quangos before them on a regular basis. If you are heading up a significant quango in the United Kingdom, it is very likely that you will appear before a Select Committee.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08012477000010"></a>I appreciate that my time is up. I want to apologise to the House for the rather split nature of my response. That is a reflection of the fact that there was a duality to this debate. But there is coherence in that answerability must occur right across the sector. As far as quangos are concerned, we must guarantee that that is so. We must also welcome the development of the welfare society in which many of the state services are delivered more effectively through third sector organisations and charities and the church, rather than through the old models of the delivery of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08012477000014"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I am the first to acknowledge the somewhat specialist nature of the subject matter. It is, however, a subject of life-changing importance to a large number of people.

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08012477000015"></a>There are some 300,000 users of incontinence products and services alone, many of them extremely vulnerable. We are talking about people with spinal injuries, MS or disability resulting from a stroke, and about the frail elderly as well as about a sizeable group of children and young adults. A wide range of appliances and products is available on prescription to enable these patients not only to manage their condition but in many cases to lead regular lives without having to worry about the risks and difficulties that they would otherwise experience. If someone can manage their own incontinence condition at home, this will obviously reduce demands on primary and community care as well as on hospitals.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_421"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08012477000016"></a>For the past two years, there has been a series of consultations reviewing the arrangements whereby manufacturers in this field are reimbursed for their products and services. It is important to make it clear straightaway that I completely support the Department of Health in seeking to secure better value for money for the taxpayer and in trying to identify areas of the budget where justifiable savings can be made. I also recognise that any process of that kind is bound to be tough and to include some hard bargaining. Businesses that find the heat turned on them in this sense will never find it comfortable and will naturally object to anything that might threaten their profit and loss account. Unfortunately, not much can be done about that. I therefore say to the Minister that a review of these reimbursement arrangements is not objectionable. On the contrary, when it started its review the department articulated several aims with which none of us could possibly disagree. The principal aims were to maintain, and where applicable improve, the quality of care to patients; to secure value for money for the NHS; to ensure equitable payment for services and transparency in pricing; to facilitate innovation; and to maintain local choice&#151;all very admirable objectives.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08012477000017"></a>The problems have arisen in the way in which the review has been conducted. The system proposed would classify products and appliances into categories. In each category, the cheapest product, as long as it had a certain very small market share, would set the benchmark price. That benchmark price would determine the maximum price for any product in the same category; namely, 20 per cent higher, subject to a maximum price reduction of 35 per cent for any product. The alternative proposal is simpler: a straightforward price reduction across the board of 12 per cent. Either of these formulae would deliver budget savings of around &#163;25 million a year.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08012477000018"></a>The striking feature of these proposals is their arbitrary character. Neither of the proposed approaches appears to have any rationale beyond a desire to save a pre-determined amount of money. However, the system of product classification also defies logic. What the Commercial Directorate has done is classify high-quality, specialist appliances alongside inferior items that are priced at a lower level. If I were to place three types of incontinence bag on the Table, noble Lords might at first glance see little difference between them. However, one of them would be a cheap bag designed to be thrown away after a single use. Another, by contrast, would be a more expensive bag, designed to be used and re-used for a week or longer. The third would be a bag, also of a more sophisticated design, intended for use at night. The cheap, single-use bag would be the price-setter in that category.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08012477000019"></a>Under the department&#146;s proposals, no recognition is given to either the quality or the cost-effectiveness of the other products. Nor are the benefits to patients in having a more sophisticated product and thereby a better quality of life anywhere taken into account. The result of lumping into one category all articles falling under the heading of urine collection bags, where there is a very wide range of quality and functionality, is that you are bound to end up with a classification that is frankly bogus. The very fact that  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_422"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there would be a cap of 35 per cent on the price reduction borne by any one product is a tacit recognition of that.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08012477000020"></a>The consequence of these proposals, if they were implemented, would be the withdrawal from the market of many specialist products and appliances. They would no longer be economically viable to make and distribute. These products would almost certainly be the ones that are the most innovative and technologically advanced. The losers in that situation would, of course, be the patients who have come to rely on them. It is difficult to believe that such patients would see their choice as having been enhanced.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08012477000021"></a>There would also be the practical consequences for the NHS. Every patient who was obliged to start using a different product would have to be assessed and, alongside that, there would be a significant cost attached to nursing and nurse training. Cheaper products bring with them a higher risk of infection and other complications. To the extent that patients experience such complications, the burden on GPs and accident and emergency departments will be the greater.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08012477000022"></a>The department is also proposing a capped and banded payment structure for remunerating the various services provided to those who use incontinence and stoma products. We are talking here about home delivery, telephone helplines, nurse advisory services and items provided to patients at no charge, such as refuse bags and wipes. People who suffer from spinal injury and other serious medical conditions often have impaired mobility and are confined to their homes for long periods. Many are dependent on home delivery and help from nurses if anything should go wrong. The advice I have received from product manufacturers is that the reimbursement being proposed for these services would make them, in many cases, uneconomic. That is of huge concern, not least for patients living in rural areas who find it difficult or impossible to get to a pharmacist, even if they have a pharmacist who is open at the necessary times.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08012477000023"></a>The system of product classification leads to a further very grave concern. When the consultation first began, one of the stated objectives of the review was to facilitate innovation. Since then, however, the commercial directorate has made it clear that the product classification it is proposing would be a once-and-for-all exercise. If you ossify a classification in this way, there is no means by which new and innovative ideas will be able to get a look-in. Indeed, it is far from clear how a new product that is not compatible with one of the existing categories will be listed at all. One of the hallmarks of UK manufacturers has been their ability to respond to the needs of patients by producing innovative solutions. The interim report published by the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, emphasised the importance of harnessing new treatments and technologies as swiftly as possible. I simply do not see how the department&#146;s current approach is consistent with that aim.</p>

<a name="80124-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08012477000024"></a>The department&#146;s position is apparently that manufacturing costs have gone down, but the NHS is not benefiting from these efficiencies. That view ignores the GDP deflator, which forms part of the existing  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_423"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements for Part IX. The deflator has generated an effective price reduction of 11.5 per cent in the decade leading up to the start of the review. Since then, there has been a price freeze, which has tightened the squeeze on manufacturers even further, and, in the last three or four years, a marked rise in the cost of raw materials, such as plastics.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08012477000025"></a>It is not the position of manufacturers that I am principally concerned about, but the position of patients. In preparing for this debate, I spoke to a number of patient groups, including the Spinal Injuries Association. Thirty years ago, a large proportion of people with spinal injuries died not from their injuries, but of bladder and kidney infections. Average life expectancy for a paraplegic was 10 to 15 years. Since the introduction of better and more sophisticated products, such as sterile catheters, thousands of lives have been saved. If these catheters were to be withdrawn from the market, it is no exaggeration to say that there would be a risk to the lives of many wheelchair-bound patients. The damage to their quality of life would also be significant. The single biggest cause of relationship breakdown among spinally injured people is incontinence. It was quite extraordinary to hear from the association that no impact assessment of the department&#146;s proposals has yet been carried out. Although there was supposed to be a consultation with users, the consultation document is so technical as to be unintelligible to anyone other than a professional. It is true that the association was permitted to meet the commercial directorate, but only to discuss a list of questions submitted in advance. No supplementary questions were allowed. That does not seem to me to be an approach that could be described as open or patient-friendly.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08012477000026"></a>Another group of patients I want to talk about briefly is children. Bowel and bladder problems affect three main groups of children: namely, those who are not toilet trained because they are slow developers; those with spinal injury or congenital problems, such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy; and those with a learning disability. All three groups combined number about half a million children across the UK. Many of those children will have lifelong problems. Every single one will need individual assessment and a service that can deal with more complex needs when they arise. Industry, once again, has responded to those needs, not least for incontinent children with congenital defects or spinal cord injury, many of whom are able to become independent and to take responsibility for themselves at a very young age.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08012477000027"></a>In the old days, a child who required a catheter had to have it permanently inserted with collection apparatus attached to his or her legs. That, quite apart from any psychological trauma, brought with it a very high risk of renal damage. The single most important innovation in the past 30 years has been the low friction hydrophilic catheter. It is essentially a lubricated device which can be inserted into the urethra when the bladder needs emptying and then can be removed. The incidence of renal failure since the introduction of that product has fallen dramatically.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08012477000028"></a>The difference in price is between a basic item, not dissimilar to a length of windscreen washer tubing, which costs 40p, and a more modern, fit-for-purpose  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_424"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>product that is priced at &#163;1.47. For many years, only the first of those was available. The basic product, if used regularly, would commonly scratch the urethra causing bleeding and scarring, even sometimes wearing a hole in the side of it. In boys, an indwelling catheter would not uncommonly result in the complete splitting open of the penis. I could tell a similar story for bowel incontinence. The sad irony was that these things were not often thought to matter since the life expectancy of such children was short. Very much thanks to the newer appliances, that is no longer so, which is why to turn back the clock now would be wholly unforgivable.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08012477000029"></a>I mention those unpleasant details to emphasise one point: any review of the reimbursement system for stoma and incontinence products has to be more than just an accountancy exercise. The commercial directorate is full of people from Deloitte who I am sure know about money, but they may not know quite as much as they should about the reality of living with incontinence as a wheelchair-bound person or the major advance in patient safety and quality of life that the newer technologies have offered.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08012477000030"></a>If the inadvertent result of this review should be the imposition of suffering and risk on patients, that would be quite unacceptable. The department&#146;s pronouncements on the matter, though superficially reassuring, leave their ultimate intentions opaque. It is unsettling that a number of the aims that were articulated at the very start of the exercise appear to have been abandoned. I hope very much that the Minister, with her customary understanding and good sense, will wish to look into the concerns I have raised and will make sure that the worst fears harboured by some of us are not borne out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08012477000034"></a>My second interest is on behalf of carers. There are 6 million people with continence problems, and we can depend on possibly half of those having a family member or friend who helps them. Incontinence is a major factor in the failure of care at home. There are statistics which show that incontinence, especially faecal incontinence, may be the factor that prevents informal carers from being able to continue caring, resulting in admission to care home or hospital. Services which are easily accessible, products which can be delivered to the home and support staff who can advise and help are almost as important to carers as they are to sufferers. Many a carer has been surprised that incontinence can be treated as well as contained, and delighted by the effects the treatments can sometimes have. For this reason it is important that innovation and the development of stoma and other products are not stifled at this time.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08012477000035"></a>I hope it will be apparent that ensuring that those services continue to be provided makes sound economic as well as moral sense in this context. I am sure all noble Lords are familiar with the figure that I never hesitate to give this House, that carers save the nation &#163;87 billion per year. They give care willingly and with love, but often with severe financial strain to themselves and their families. Carers are often required to give up paid employment to care, but the most frequent explanation given by carers for their worsening financial situation is the extra costs of disability and illness. These are many and varied. As we know, caring for someone with incontinence can double the cost of laundry, bedding and clothing. Carers have difficulty getting out to do the shopping, let alone to collect incontinence supplies, and value home deliveries hugely&#151;as do the users of stoma products.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08012477000036"></a>Remember, too, that the experts who advise on the choice and use of these products are as important as the products themselves. We must ensure that access to specially trained nurses and technicians is maintained and improved.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08012477000037"></a>I hope that when any changes in services are considered, Ministers will ensure that what results is an improvement not a curtailment and that we will bear in mind the financial circumstances of the families who deal with this problem&#151;usually in silence and often in secret. We must ensure that they are supported, recognised and not given yet another problem to face in the emotional, practical and financial difficulties they are already wrestling with.</p>

In his opening speech he examined the review in great detail and presented valid criticisms of its methodology. I shall not follow him down that path. I raised some issues about the review in Questions for Written Answer last year when the Government received such a volume of responses to their consultation that they postponed changes planned for last July.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08012477000039"></a>Before I proceed, I declare my interest as a patient user of stoma items and have been for a decade. I hope that my personal experience and account of it will give noble Lords a clearer insight into the sensitivities involved in this area. Ten years ago, I was diagnosed as suffering from diverticulitis and underwent a colostomy operation, which resulted in the removal of the sigmoid section of the colon. The operation left me with a stoma which enables excretion through it into a bag on my lower left side. I would have wished to spare the House these medical details, but they have to be presented to enable anyone who is unfamiliar with a colostomy to appreciate what is involved in the physical management of the resulting stoma.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08012477000040"></a>Over the 10 years I have had no significant problems, which I attribute in no small part to the high quality of the prescribed items used, from the flange surround of the stoma, which has to be changed weekly, to the bag attachment, which I change as necessary, at least on a daily basis and sometimes more frequently. I must also commend the reliability, celerity and smoothness of the home delivery service providing these essential items, without which I really do not know how I could live a near normal life. In my case, the items are supplied by an assembly and distribution company at Fittleworth in West Sussex. The items include some made by ConvaTec, a Bristol-Myers Squibb company, which has a manufacturing plant in north-east Wales&#151;a plant that I opened 25 years ago.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08012477000041"></a>In the early stages of managing my stoma, there were accidental mishaps, all due to my own inexperience or lack of care. Mercifully, none occurred in public. I can only imagine one&#146;s consternation and others&#146; disgust if these accidents happened coram publico. Such accidents are, of course, always possible, but the excellent quality of the items supplied means that one can depend on and be confident in their reliability, which is clearly of vital importance.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08012477000042"></a>When one reads about the history of this lengthy review, and the Minister&#146;s reply to me on 9 May last year that savings might be made of some &#163;27 million in the total cost of Tariff List items of some &#163;169 million, one cannot but wonder what is to be sacrificed. One hopes that it will not be the quality or reliability of the products. My noble friend on the Front Bench in his opening speech gave us an indication where those cuts might occur. The suppliers, who numbered about 68 last year, are fearful that all kinds of sacrifices will be required of them to the disadvantage of their patient customers. Coloplast, one of the major suppliers, is especially concerned; it believes that it will bear a disproportionate part of the cost cut and will have to abandon the making of certain products. Research and care services are also at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08012477000043"></a>The Minister at the Department of Health last year was the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, who told me on the Floor of the House:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08012477000085"></a>&#147;Let me make it absolutely clear that the last thing I want to do is to inhibit the provision of the kind of services that he&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08012477000080"></a>that is, me&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08012477000089"></a>&#147;has described. This is about value for money and ensuring that we move away from the difficult-to-understand financial regime and payments to the various contractors to a transparent system that is based on value and enhancing the service to the public. We should make sure that that happens&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/4/07; col. 556.]</ul>
<p><a name="08012477000081"></a>There were other assurances to the same effect. On 12 June, he told me in a Written Answer:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08012477000086"></a>&#147;In conducting this review, a key objective has been to maintain and improve the quality of patient care&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/6/07; col. <I>WA 243</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012477000082"></a>Like my noble friend, I sincerely hope that the Government adhere to the principle that the object of the review is to improve patient care.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08012477000044"></a>I hope that the Minister will reassure us today that the quality of the service will not deteriorate&#151;and I am sure that my hope is endorsed by the 450,000 patients who receive the 4.5 million dispensed items covered by the tariff lists. Those figures were given to me by the Government, so they must be right. Many of those patients are victims of other illnesses and are highly vulnerable. We must make certain that we do not add to their suffering.</p>

I declare an interest: along with nearly everyone with a spinal cord injury, I have had to use continence products&#151;in my case for 40 years, after I broke my neck while a student at university. Sadly, this debate was announced at short notice, so not as many people were available to speak as would have liked to. There is deep, widespread concern about what is proposed. I hope the Minister will do all she can to ensure that these concerns are addressed.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08012477000046"></a>Surely there is no condition that is more humiliating than incontinence. Few afflictions make you more depressed, more isolated and less socially acceptable than not being in control of your bladder or bowels. Imagine being at a party and suddenly finding a pool beneath your chair&#151;or the horror of a man who goes up to accept an award in his wheelchair, leaving a trail of diarrhoea behind him. If you cannot control your bladder and bowels, you are condemned to a life sentence of housebound isolation. It is impossible to lead a normal social life, let alone go out to work. Incontinence can place a far greater limitation on our life than not being able to walk, yet such is our embarrassment about the subject that it is rarely mentioned.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08012477000047"></a>About 20 years ago, I was one of a group of 16 tetraplegic and paraplegic women who wrote a book called <I>Able Lives: Women&#146;s Experience of Paralysis</I>. It was based on responses from 205 women with spinal cord injuries. We each wrote a chapter on one aspect  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_428"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the condition and mine was incontinence. Reading it again for this debate was encouraging, in a way, because the range of provision has improved so much. The chapter set out the way in which incontinence could rule our lives. Katharine, one of the contributors, said,</p>
<ul><a name="08012477000090"></a>&#147;it dominates 99.9 per cent of my time&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80124-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08012477000048"></a>The book also reminded me how little help was available then. Twenty years ago, if you wanted a discreet and efficient pad, you had to make your own, which meant spending countless hours wrapping cotton wool and cellulose wadding into squares of gauze. Innovation and investment by the market has transformed the products and appliances available&#151;and that is what is so worrying about the Department of Health proposals, which threaten to return us to the embarrassing uncertainty of relying on products that do not properly meet our needs.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08012477000049"></a>The clear message from the book <I>Able Lives </I>was that what worked for one person did not work for another. The struggles that each woman went through in finding a method and products that worked for her meant that, once a satisfactory solution was found, it was a devastating prospect if for any reason that had to change. It is this hard-won security that is being threatened by the drug tariff proposals.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08012477000050"></a>The Department of Health Commercial Directorate has been conducting this review over two years with five consultations, yet there remain major concerns about the latest range of proposals and the negative effect that they will have if implemented. There has been a shameful lack of user involvement in conducting this review, as the three user organisations&#151;the Spinal Injuries Association, the Urostomy Association and Incontact&#151;pointed out in the letter that they sent to the Minister last July. They said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012477000091"></a>&#147;the Directorate is continuing to ignore the needs and views of patient users of continence/urology appliances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012477000083"></a>They continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08012477000087"></a>&#147;Healthcare professional and patient use of products is different and education is a two way process&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012477000084"></a>They also said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08012477000088"></a>&#147;Most long term patients rarely see a specialist nurse and therefore the latter are often not fully aware of the need for some products. Most professionals only know of a limited number of appliances/catheters&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08012477000051"></a>As we have heard, there are many concerns. The Urology Trade Association warns that the size of the proposed cuts will make many products economically unviable to produce and will stifle innovation. People who have used the same trusted product for decades are likely to find that it has gone out of production and they will be thrown back to the early days of utter insecurity while they try to find a product that suits them. Again their continence will dominate 99.9 per cent of their time. What hope is there of maintaining your social life, let alone your employment, in the mean time?</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08012477000052"></a>There are further major concerns with the way in which goods have been classified within the proposed category-based system, as we heard. Products have been misclassified, with the result that high-quality, specialist appliances have been classified alongside inferior items at a low price. That could lead to serious medical complications for some users, let alone humiliating  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_429"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>embarrassment. For instance, superficially similar urine bags may be more or less vulnerable to splitting depending on the materials that are used in their construction.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08012477000053"></a>User groups such as the Spinal Injuries Association have been assiduous in providing feedback on the Commercial Directorate&#146;s proposals, yet the proposals remain full of errors. For example, latex and latex-free products are confused, which could have devastating and potentially life-threatening consequences for anyone with an allergy to latex.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08012477000054"></a>One of the most worrying of the industry&#146;s concerns about these proposals is its warning about their effect on the help and support that will be available. The Department of Health has proposed a capped and banded payment structure for remunerating service provision. The industry warns that suppliers will no longer be able to provide those services that are essential in giving users reassurance and peace of mind in managing their condition, such as the telephone helplines and nurse advisory services. Other services that are threatened are those that help to reduce your frustration, to maintain your dignity and to save invaluable time, such as prescription collection, the wonderful discreet, fast and efficient home delivery services and provision of all the necessary complementary items such as wipes and disposal bags. These services enable you to deal with your incontinence as just an inconvenient but minor facet of your life. Take them away and incontinence once again becomes a major issue of organisation and management that dominates everything that you do.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08012477000055"></a>Will my noble friend tell the House whether any work has been done to assess the impact that these proposals will have on other aspects of government policy? If these proposals are implemented in their present state, as user groups fear, patient choice, which is rightly at the heart of government policy, will obviously be dramatically reduced. What about the impact on employment policy and the drive to reduce the numbers of disabled people dependent on benefit? </p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08012477000056"></a>I have concentrated on the experience of spinal cord injured people whose ability to find employment is certainly dictated by whether they can manage their continence. You do not see the people who are not managing, because they cannot leave their homes. The difference between two catheters may seem immaterial to people who do not use them, but if one of them leaks and the other does not, that changes your whole life.</p>

<a name="80124-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08012477000057"></a>Finally, what assessment has been made of the impact on the health service, with the inevitable increase in repeated medical consultations, the resulting health complications and hospital admissions? I hope that my noble friend the Minister will do all that she can to ensure that these concerns are properly understood and comprehensively addressed, and bring some hope after the misery of this interminable, unsatisfactory review.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, and I have a little game in which we talk about the follow-on costs of government spending. They were mentioned by everyone involved in the debate today. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, gave the best example when she summed up her remarks by saying how what we were doing tied in with the rest of government policy. The Government are spending a great deal of money on welfare to work interviews and so forth for disabled people, which was in the last Welfare Bill. If you remove a product that works, that means people are not mobile. Are you not then counteracting another part of government policy? I will leave that point there because I have made it dozens of times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08012477000060"></a>The last time we spoke about this I mentioned kicking through the Chinese walls in Westminster to try to get the Government to realise what was happening. That still applies. To concentrate purely on the Department of Health, has the department assessed what it would cost to change a product that is satisfactory at the moment to something does not work in 10 per cent of cases? That is a reasonable question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08012477000061"></a>If the department finds itself having to provide other services, such as emergency services and admissions to hospital, what would that do to the pricing structure? The general consensus from the briefing that I have received&#151;and people have been on their toes&#151;seems to be that the system is delivering happy customers, patients, clients; call them what you like. There seems to be a degree of satisfaction with the current system. The phrase, &#147;If it ain't broke don't fix it&#148; comes to mind.</p>

One&#146;s normal allies in cost-cutting are saying, &#147;Wait a minute, there may be a problem about the implementation of this. It may stop the innovation. Patients who are stable and able to carry on with the rest of their lives will make fewer demands&#148;. Has that been factored in? Is that on the balance sheet and, if so, where?</p>

How will the Government address these concerns?

Until very recently, and through gross ignorance, I was not aware of the vital importance of these matters to thousands of people&#151;the individuals who use stoma and urology products but also, as my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley so eloquently pointed out, their carers and their families. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and to my noble friend Lady Wilkins for the honesty with which they dealt with this rather difficult subject today. That certainly helps us, and I hope helps the Government, to appreciate the problems that have to be overcome. Those of us who do not suffer these problems do not realise how much we have to be thankful for.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08012477000066"></a>I have spoken to colleagues in this House who use stoma and incontinence products every day, and to those who have used them for months or perhaps years. No matter how long or short the period of use, people require products that suit their needs, fit, do not cause skin problems and are user friendly. They want a choice of products and follow-up care.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08012477000067"></a>I reassure noble Lords that no decisions will be made as an outcome of the Part IX review that compromise the quality of care. Part IX is complex. It consists of more than 5,000 items and there is no transparency between what is reimbursed to dispensing appliance contractors for these items and the moneys that they receive for service provision. Dispensing appliance contractors and pharmacists also have different terms of service. The review seeks to unbundle these costs, define services and ensure that the NHS, and taxpayers, are receiving value for money from the &#163;240 million that is spent in this area. However, I, of course, acknowledge that the review has caused a great deal of concern not only among users of the appliances but also among dispensing appliance contractors and those who manufacture these products. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, if it ain&#146;t broke don&#146;t fix it. That is an attractive idea but I understand that Part IX has not been reviewed for 20 years and I think that it is beholden on government to look into these things from time to time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08012477000068"></a>Bladder and bowel problems and incontinence are common problems, particularly among older people, people with disabilities and many children. They are of a very sensitive nature and impact significantly on a person&#146;s quality of life. The department estimates that about 450,000 individuals use stoma and urology appliances. Some will need them intermittently but the majority will be dependent on them. Quality of life is of primary importance to these patients. All want to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_432"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be as independent as possible and to contribute fully to the overall well-being of the economy. As the noble Earl said, these appliances ensure that patients can lead regular lives and reduce demand on primary and community care, and as my noble friends said, that makes good economic sense to individuals and families.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08012477000069"></a>Noble Lords are, of course, aware that my noble friend Lord Darzi is leading a wide-ranging review of the NHS to ensure that a properly resourced NHS is clinically led, patient-centred and locally accountable. His vision for the NHS is that it should be fair, effective, personalised and safe. The overarching aims of the Part IX review are fully consistent with that, and every effort has been made throughout the review to engage with patient groups to reassure them and to listen to their concerns.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08012477000070"></a>My noble friend Lady Wilkins expressed concern that there has not been adequate patient and stakeholder engagement. Such engagement is vital and there can never be enough, but I assure noble Lords that officials have met representatives from the Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group, the Spinal Injuries Association, InContact and the urology association. My right honourable friend Dawn Primarolo, the Minister for Health, has agreed to meet with a consortium of patient organisations representing users of urology appliances. Officials have also met representatives from the NHS, particularly those specialised in the area of stoma and incontinence care, such as the Royal College of Nurses and the World Council of Enterostomal Therapists. They have also met nurses who specialise in childhood incontinence, as such patients have very special needs. The noble Earl cited the specific problems relating to paraplegics and children and the advances that have been made so that their lives can have real quality. He is right that this review must not only be about value for money but about valued lives for individuals. I will certainly ask the department to look into the cases that he raised. Officials have also met trade bodies representing the dispensing community and manufacturers.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08012477000071"></a>Given our understanding of patient concerns, the department has sought to reassure patients and industry that the maintenance of their care is a key aim of the review. We want to ensure that, no matter where in England a user of stoma or incontinence appliances lives, they are all offered the same standards of service. Such services include home delivery and home visits made by specialist nurses employed directly by dispensing appliance contractors&#151;DACs&#151;and pharmacists. While we recognise the important contribution that these individuals make to patient care, we believe that their role is to complement the work of NHS specialist nurses. As such, we need to ensure that they are suitably qualified to deal directly with patients.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="08012477000072"></a>Currently, the invaluable services provided by DACs and pharmacists are not service requirements, so they are not provided by all and to all, and, where they are provided, it is not necessarily to the same standard. Our proposals seek to embed in legislation agreed standards of service delivery and ensure fair remuneration, thus creating a level playing field and a  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_433"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 433</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wider choice for patients. Standards of service must include proper information about the product and advice thereafter.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08012477000073"></a>However, dispensing appliance contractors have expressed concerns that there is not enough money currently in the system to cover the services that we propose that both they and pharmacists should provide. They are concerned that services could be at risk. Such views are being taken very seriously, given our aim to maintain and, where appropriate, improve patient care. Given the role of specialist nurses employed directly by providers to complement the work of NHS specialist nurses, we will discuss that with interested parties when we meet shortly.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="08012477000074"></a>Noble Lords have referred to the proposed classification of items that the department put forward for comment. Our aim was to make it easier for prescribers to identify the appropriate product to match a patient&#146;s medical need. I fully understand that each patient is an individual with individual needs. In order to arrive at a proposed classification, officials worked with specialist healthcare professionals. The overriding criterion was not one of price, but was to ensure that items were classified according to their ability to meet similar medical needs. I note the concerns expressed by the noble Earl. The review is certainly not intended to stifle innovation and new technologies; quite the opposite. I will take up those important issues with the department.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="08012477000075"></a>A key aim of the review is to ensure that the NHS is receiving value for money; hence the proposed reduction in reimbursement for items. Some manufacturers have told the department that the proposed reductions in reimbursement for items could lead to a large number of items being discontinued. Items are routinely de-listed by manufacturers from Part IX; in fact, 379 items and 121 ranges were deleted in 2007. I understand that patients are anxious to ensure that their preferred products are maintained on the list and that they have real choice. We are therefore in discussion with industry to identify a level of adjustment that is affordable to industry.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_434"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column 434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="08012477000076"></a>The department acknowledges that the Part IX review in respect of stoma and incontinence appliances seems to have gone on for a long time. This is because Part IX is a complex sector. Given the highly sensitive and personal nature of the conditions for which these products are used, we needed to take time to arrive at new arrangements that are right not only for the NHS and providers but, most importantly, for patients.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="08012477000077"></a>The last consultation closed on 28 December and officials are analysing the responses. However, my right honourable friend Dawn Primarolo, the Minister for Health, has agreed that officials should sit down with dispensing contractors and manufacturers to discuss the best ways in which to conclude the review. These meetings have begun and are due to conclude by the end of February. Once the discussions have concluded, the department will publish a full impact assessment and interested parties will be given an opportunity to comment.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="08012477000078"></a>I note all the concerns that have been expressed about the assessment and the desire that it should cover issues such as the impact on other government departments and on employment, for example. I do not know what the assessment has covered, but I will certainly look into this and come back to noble Lords with further information.</p>

<a name="80124-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="08012477000079"></a>In conclusion, we welcome this short debate. I regret that it has been so short. The Government recognise the importance of the issues raised and truly are committed to ensuring that patient care is not compromised because of the review. I hope that this debate will assist not only in reassuring patients, but will encourage others to speak out about these issues, which are intensely personal, but about which there should be no embarrassment. In the mean time, I will ensure that the people undertaking the review are given a copy of the report in <I>Hansard</I> of this debate and I will ask them to take into account all of the points raised. This is a complex issue, but essentially it is about dignity and quality of life for patients as well as about value for money for taxpayers.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="08012454000004"></a>The Committee met at two o'clock.</h4>


<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000005"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (VISCOUNT ALLENBY OF MEGIDDO) in the Chair.]</p>

<p><a name="08012454000006"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012454000085"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo):</b> It has been agreed that should any Questions for Short Debate not run for the allocated one hour this afternoon, the Committee will adjourn during pleasure until the end of the hour. Therefore, each of the Questions for Short Debate will start on the hour.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="08012454000002"></a>Railways: Capacity</h3>

<p><a name="08012454000007"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012454000086"></a>Lord Bradshaw</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what plans they have to deal with overcrowding and capacity on railway services.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000008"></a>The noble Lord said: I make no apology for bringing the subject of railways back to your Lordships. We are desperately short of capacity now. There is no spare passenger rolling stock on the railway. In many cases, you cannot park a car after  8 am because the car parks are full. There is no energy strategy, despite the looming oil crisis, and, generally speaking, there are no diversionary routes available for much of the network. I submit that there is a lot of suppressed demand in the system, and frustration among passengers will grow and grow.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000009"></a>The reason for this is not the lack of potential investment. The Government do not have the cash anyway, but franchisees and rolling stock companies have plenty of cash, and utilities are a good investment, particularly at a time when stock markets are falling.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000010"></a>I believe that the Government&#146;s lack of vision is causing this crisis. The Government and their officials are very good at producing reports, studies and procrastination. They are poor when it comes to vision, courage and enterprise. Because of that, there is a lack of investment.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000011"></a>The Minister for railways in another place is very strong about not writing detailed timetables or managing the rolling stock cascade. These things are repeated over and over again. But there is no rolling stock; there are bottlenecks which prevent timetabling being more flexible. The Government, in my submission, have the industry by the throat. Their policy is to eke out capacity by means of high fares and short franchises, which means lack of investment. Indeed, the franchises are too short to enable the investment demands to be met. If somebody says that the rolling stock companies can buy more rolling stock, there is the question of getting the Government&#146;s permission or getting residual guarantees. So the Government are holding the industry by the throat.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000012"></a>I have some proposals. The southern franchise is about to be specified and I suggest that this specification should include the opening of the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Uckfield to Lewes line. All of us who know about railways know that that is the key to unlocking capacity on the Brighton main line, which is one of the most congested in the country. It would enable us to access the south coast by one way or the other when, as frequently happens, engineering work blocks the main line. But that specification should be much wider and more generous. It should insist on more car parking space&#151;not the odd hundred spaces here or there but thousands. It should insist on longer platforms and more rolling stock. That franchise will come at a price, which may be that you have to give the people longer. I believe that the best thing we can do is to make the franchise as long as necessary with flexibility, rising performance standards, maximum fares related to the retail prices index, investment, commitment and revenue-sharing arrangements, which would give both parties some protection.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000013"></a>I turn to the subject of the west coast main line and the Virgin franchise. I remind the Minister that we have a Question about that on Monday and I hope to get more answers then than he may be able to give today. This line is already full&#151;my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie will elaborate on that&#151;and is growing at 10 per cent per annum, which is much faster than the Government forecast. We must have more capacity well before 2012. I gather that negotiations have broken down between Virgin and the department but I suggest that the Minister for railways goes by himself to meet the managing director of Virgin&#151;without officials from the department, the Treasury, BERR, or lots of the consultants who support them&#151;and that the two of them lock themselves in a room until an agreement is reached. That is how international diplomacy works, and I suggest that Scotland and England may be classed as international in this context. I am sure that Mr Harris is quite above any bribery.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000014"></a>I would not like to be the rail Minister, who in two or three years&#146; time goes to the country and visits the north-west and Scotland. By then, the railway system will be bursting at the seams; there will be wicked overcrowding and very high fares. What sort of legacy is that for a Minister for railways?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000015"></a>We know that train lengthening and resignalling are much, much cheaper than building new roads or railways. The figures are based on capacity and on the cost of doing the work, and I am perfectly happy to let the Minister see the figures if he has not already done so.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000016"></a>I should like to say another thing about electrification. I have had a piece of work done privately by an individual and he has shown that, by electrifying 167 route miles, which is a very small amount, we could convert a large number of InterCity or near- InterCity trains from diesel to electricity, which would enhance several of the diversionary routes. I know that there are arguments against electrification. They are fostered by people in the department who talk about things such as the advent of a fuel cell. I was around longer ago than I care to remember when fusion and advanced nuclear power were going to make electricity so cheap that we could almost give it away. That did not happen and I am sure that fuel cells are also pretty unlikely to happen.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000017"></a>I want to make one last point. The department is arranging a competition for the InterCity Express. This will be a train powered by diesel and electricity. If, instead of putting diesel on that train, a coupling was put at each end which could easily and automatically be attached to a diesel locomotive, then the extremities of the system&#151;which by the time this comes along will probably be Plymouth, Cardiff, Edinburgh and places such as that&#151;will be able to be serviced by electric trains by simply towing them with a diesel engine over the last bit of the line. One has to remember the huge advantage that would be gained from not having diesel engines and not carrying around the huge quantities of fuel that each of these trains has when it sets off on its day&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000018"></a>The railways are in a crisis, but there are ways out of it which a Minister with the courage of the honourable Member responsible for rail services can find. However, he will have to cut himself loose from the bureaucracy and paraphernalia that surround his office in order to branch out, saying, &#147;This is what I&#146;m going to do. This is how we&#146;re going to do it. You can keep all your consultants&#146; reports because I know that this is common sense, and that is what I want to do&#148;.</p>
<h5><a name="08012454000079"></a>2.10 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012454000019"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012454000087"></a>Lord Rosser:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for securing this debate, and the thrust of my comments will be not dissimilar to his. The issue is important as demand for rail services continues to rise, with growth at 6 per cent a year being twice the rate assumed in the 2007 White Paper. In 2006, a total of more than 45 billion passenger kilometres were travelled; that was an increase of 6.5 per cent over the previous 12 months and was indeed the highest growth rate in Europe. Over the past decade, passenger kilometres travelled have risen by well over 40 per cent, again the highest in Europe, and are now at a higher level than at any time since 1946. Freight traffic has also been increasing, with tonne kilometres up by more than 60 per cent since the beginning of the 1990s. With the population rising, the economy growing, road congestion at the very best unlikely to decline and the cost of fuel on an upward trend, the increase in numbers travelling by rail and the expansion in freight traffic will continue.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000020"></a>Some increases in capacity are in the pipeline, as set out in the White Paper. Crossrail will add significantly to London&#146;s total public transport system, but it is to be nearly another decade before services start to operate, and that is assuming that the plans run to time. The July 2007 Government White Paper was widely welcomed for the positive future it outlined for rail, but it was based on an increase in rail capacity to address growth of 22 per cent up to 2014, and beyond that a projected doubling of traffic over the next 30 years. The question is this: has the increase in rail capacity been underestimated in the light of continuing trends, and if so, what needs to be done to deal with the overcrowding and capacity shortfalls that will result? One answer is to put up the fares and freight charges to reduce demand until it matches whatever is the existing capacity. That is  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certainly a policy, but it is not one with which I would agree, and I hope to hear from my noble friend that it is not a policy that the Government would countenance. That is because it is not much good extolling the environmental advantages of rail and encouraging people to use public transport if the supply side of the equation in the form of capacity is not to be effectively addressed to meet the demand.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000021"></a>It is with this point in mind that I, too, want to raise a question about addressing capacity issues in the short term on the west coast main line. In December 2006, Virgin Trains entered into an amended franchise agreement based on forecasts of an average annual 9 per cent growth in passenger demand to the end of the franchise period in 2012. The actual demand since December 2006 has exceeded forecasts and is already running at levels predicted for 2008-09. Service frequencies are to be increased before long with, for example, three trains per hour to Birmingham and Manchester, but the current capacity of the Pendolino trains will not cope with the future predicted growth, so there will be overcrowding before the end of the franchise term. Virgin Trains says that lengthening the Pendolino trains from nine to 11 cars would address capacity concerns which already exist at peak times and accommodate predicted growth on the franchise up to 2018. But in return for the risks arising from disruption to passengers and the financial expense of such a train-lengthening programme, I understand that Virgin Trains sought a two-year extension on the franchise to enable it to recoup the investment.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000022"></a>This the Government appear to have declined to agree to, presumably on the basis that either they do not think it represents value for money for the taxpayer, or alternatively because they do not accept Virgin Trains&#146; forecast on traffic growth and the consequences for overcrowding on the west coast main line. I would like to hear from my noble friend what the Government&#146;s position is on addressing the apparently imminent overcrowding issue on the west coast main line. Are discussions still continuing with Virgin Trains or is there a complete impasse? That specific case is important because similar issues could arise from all the other routes if, as seems quite likely, the Government&#146;s projections for passenger growth up to 2014 in the 2007 White Paper prove to be significantly lower than reality. We cannot afford to have lengthy wrangles between the Government and operators and either delay in taking the necessary action or take no action at all, because it will be the passengers, both actual and potential, who will bear the adverse consequences in particular and it will be the Government's transport policy which will bear the adverse consequences in general.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000023"></a>I turn to the wider question of what the Government intend to do in the light of the much greater growth in rail traffic than that projected in the recent White Paper. Is it intended to speed up work on the initial short-term plans up to 2014 and the development of the medium-term plans scheduled for 2014 to 2019, so that they can be implemented earlier if growth continues to be stronger than forecast? Will further planning for electrification be started now, because, as has been said, electrification can raise  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capacity? Will work start on new line planning? We need action to be taken now if we are to address the imminent serious problems arising from success for the railway industry. The problems will be upon us with no solutions in place or just around the corner if we take the view that we act only when the crisis is already upon us, rather than acting early enough to avoid the problem in the first place.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000024"></a>The Government's approach to the railway industry has been positive and the White Paper was a major step forward. However, what I want to hear from my noble friend is not only answers to my specific questions about the lengthening of the Pendolino trains on the west coast main line, but what action the Government intend to take now to address the real likelihood, in the light of current trends and figures, that their estimates of growth in rail traffic in the 2007 White Paper are significantly understating the actual position of a railway network that already has capacity and overcrowding issues on some key routes and at some key locations.</p>
<h5><a name="08012454000080"></a>2.16 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012454000025"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012454000088"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for securing this short debate. He certainly scored a point with me, because I have been in the House for very many years and this is the first time that I have spoken on a transport issue, although I have spoken on many&#151;perhaps too many&#151;other subjects.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000026"></a>I declare an interest, because I attend the House every day; I have practically always attended the House and I come up every week on long-distance trains from the West Country, so I am fairly used to what actually happens. Indeed, I have done many hundreds of long-distance journeys on First Great Western rail, which will apparently stand me in good stead when I get to heaven.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000027"></a>I want to distinguish between two issues. First, there is the question of the forward planning of the rail network and the trains that run on it in such a way that we adequately foresee and provide for the volume of traffic. I stand four square with the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, on the key point of getting a reliable assessment of the forward demand and not underestimating that when we are already up against the fence. In my view, it has been clear for some time that there is substantial growth in passenger traffic and that it will continue to grow. It is after all common sense, when taking account of the small scale of our islands, the time lost in airports and the congestion or risk of congestion on many roads, especially at peak hours. In many cases, rail travel simply makes sense and we have to respond to that in planning. That is the key issue. In addition, it would be in the public interest for rail freight to increase, and that should be factored into the equation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000028"></a>To return to passenger traffic, I do not say that we have failed totally, but we have partially failed. That is not just down to the railway operating companies. The number of trains to meet demand depends on the upgrading of the track; the availability of finance; sufficient stability in the system of franchising&#151;and here, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there is sometimes a risk that we do not have that. Therefore good planning is not possible. None the less, it is depressing for someone who speaks on this subject for the first time to find that, confronted with a very large market, which is also a growth market, we do not have a sufficient number of good trains and we have not been able to avoid overcrowding, to the consequent irritation of passengers. The national news this morning tells me that there is to be a revolt of passengers on First Great Western next week. That makes two revolts over the past year: first, the shareholders of Northern Rock and now the passengers of First Great Western. Not many issues make people revolt but I believe they will next week.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000029"></a>My second point relates to the rail companies themselves. Of course, the Government could not and should not micromanage the rail system. However, Parliament should be concerned about these issues as for many citizens the journey to and from work&#151;crowded or not, punctual or not&#151;is one of the most important elements of their lives. In my part of Britain, people often use the phrase &#147;one train earlier&#148;, which means that those with fixed engagements decide to travel on an earlier train because they simply do not trust that the trains will arrive on time. On Monday week I shall take one train earlier with the consequence that I shall get up much earlier and I shall pay much more. Sometimes it is the only way that one can get to an engagement.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000030"></a>Of course, sometimes trains are late because of circumstances totally outside the control of the rail operating companies. People fall on the line, lorries run into bridges and so on, but I cannot understand why matters directly under the control of management so often go wrong. Of the many hundreds of journeys that I have made on First Great Western, in about 50 per cent of cases something has gone wrong. Lack of punctuality is the most annoying. Last week I was an hour late, which is a rather long delay for that sort of journey. Frequently the toilets do not work; or there is no water supply; or there are other obvious problems such as no reservation cards. I often find that I have booked a reservation in coach B and there is no coach B&#151;that is quite common. We also often find that a train is signalled as arriving at the station in five minutes and at the very last minute we are notified that it will arrive 10 minutes late. One would have thought that someone would have some control over what is happening to the trains as they draw close to a station, but that is not always the case. I sometimes wonder whether these minor, but oft-repeated problems ever come to the attention of middle management or senior management.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000031"></a>I loved Great Western and I could grow to love First Great Western, but I make these points because even if some of our forward planning is not always spot on&#151;it clearly is not and that is the main point for the Government&#151;the British public would truly welcome the correction of some of the small failings which are extremely difficult to take when one is paying a considerable fare and travelling, in my case, some distance. If those could be eliminated&#151;I think it is possible&#151;passengers would be even more favourably disposed towards what should be a good system and very much in the public interest.</p>

I congratulate him and the noble Lord, Lord Rosser&#151;two great experts on the railways&#151;on their contributions. I agree with just about every word. It is also good to listen to someone new like the noble Lord, Lord Williamson. He is a great expert in government generally but he has spoken from the heart. He seems to know an awful lot about First Great Western and I am sure that it will be following up with interest. It is really good to have him among the usual suspects.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000033"></a>I want to concentrate on long-term issues concerning the railways. A number of speakers have talked about the medium term and the short term and one or two have mentioned the long term. If there are to be changes to the infrastructure, they take an awful long time to build. One can probably put 30 years on both the Channel Tunnel rail link and Crossrail projects from the first definitive statement by Government that they would like them to when they actually happen. I am not saying who is to blame or why. I hope that the planning Bill will help because it does take a long time. Roads take much the same time as well.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000034"></a>I hope that the Government will take notice of what is happening on the Continent. Yesterday in Brussels I had the honour of helping to chair a conference called New Opera, which is rather an odd name for a new freight-dedicated network across Europe. It will come to the UK, although we are not the most critical area for freight. The point, however, is that the Commission is funding a study costing several million euros which is looking 25 years ahead at issues such as increase in demand, maps, commercial arrangements and how it is going to happen. Two hundred people from the industry, governments, railway companies and customers are all being very positive.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000035"></a>I have nothing to say about the French rail services&#151;I think ours are much better here. I was travelling across France two days ago on the new TGV Est when it stopped in the night in the middle of the countryside. A man announced that we had stopped for an indeterminate cause and for an indeterminate time and he did not know when he could tell us what the problem was. It was quite interesting. So we have nothing to learn from the French in running trains. On the other hand, they have a vision of what the TGV network will look like 20 years ahead. That helps businesses, industry, the public and local authorities to plan ahead.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000036"></a>The TGV is not necessarily there to get you to your destination faster, although it does. It was built originally to increase capacity on the existing lines for passenger and freight services. France is a much bigger country than the UK and we can debate whether we need high-speed lines, but we are challenged with a capacity issue and I have explained what happened in France.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000037"></a>Turning to this country, I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. As I have mentioned before, forecasts indicate that, on the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>present economic and tax scenarios, rail freight traffic will probably double in the next 20 years. Other indicators show that passenger traffic will do the same. According to our calculations, that means that in 20 years&#146; time, based on its capacity at the end of this year when the existing upgrades are finished&#151;if they are&#151;the west coast main line will be 200 trains short of capacity every day. Similar numbers apply to other major routes. With possible changes to the economic and tax systems, oil prices, road user charging and so on, demand could go up by perhaps 25 per cent. The Government have agreed the forecast for freight and so we are going to need more capacity on these lines in 20 years&#146; time&#151;or much sooner, as other noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000038"></a>In connecting ports, centres of consumption and major areas of population, it is obvious where the extra capacity has to be found. How is this going to be done? Other noble Lords have mentioned longer trains, better signalling, much quicker travel, cheaper travel, more loops for freight yards&#151;which is easier&#151;and more tracks beside existing lines, which is not very difficult either if it is within the boundaries. But then we move to more grade separation, more stations and platforms, which are quite difficult to build in towns&#151;look what happened in Birmingham&#151;new lines, be they passenger or freight, and new freight terminals. All these latter examples will need planning permission, debates and everything else that goes with them.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000039"></a>That brings me back to my 30-year example and the need to look at options. The European example I gave and the TGV French Government network do not provide a commitment to building or funding anything; it is a vision which people can buy into and then, assuming that the funding can be found and it is still wanted, the project will get built. But there needs to be a vision to start with. The Government should, very soon, produce a 25-year strategy of where they believe the railways should be and how this will be achieved bearing in mind the examples I have given. The strategy should be led by the department, with major inputs from Network Rail, the industry, the public generally and Parliament. On the basis of the forecast to which we have all referred, something needs to be done. If we do not start now, in 10 years&#146; time we shall be in serious trouble.</p>

What is more, rail passenger demand is expanding exponentially. This expansion of demand will only exacerbate the issue, despite being desirable.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000041"></a>Rail&#146;s great contribution is threefold: first, in order of ascendancy, as a substitute for domestic air travel, secondly, as a road congestion buster, and thirdly and most importantly, as an obvious form of high-speed and bulk transport. It is for good reason that the railway is a British invention. My own family constructed wagon ways first with wooden and then with iron rails in the Alloa area from the 1760s. That was during the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years of the Act of Attainder, passed on my family. Did they make good use of the attainder? Yes, they developed railways.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000042"></a>Therefore, it seems amazing that the railway on the British mainland should be in a state of such undercapacity and that we should still worry about lengthening platforms, more parking spaces, and a lack of power and electrification. Yesterday, I travelled to London with Virgin West Coast on the 6.10 from Motherwell. Privileged to have a first-class open return, I was one of two passengers in the fourth innermost first-class compartment of the Pendolino. As we descended through England, the train filled up, especially in the standard-class end with its five coaches. By Watford Junction, and one should bear in mind that it was at a decidedly off-peak moment&#151;it was 11.05 am&#151;the vestibules were full of standard-class passengers, yet it was obvious that there was space in the four first-class coaches. Can the Minister insist that Virgin West Coast declassify its fourth first-class coach regularly, at least for the off-peak services?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000043"></a>Certainly, slowly, capacity is being constructed, but we have to talk about the middle distance and well into the future. Crossrail will help. High Speed 1 is already helping and perhaps, by 2010, when some Kent commuters are able to use the High Speed 1 domestic services, it will be even more of a help. However, High Speed 2, to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds from London Heathrow, is still in its infancy or perhaps at an even earlier stage.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000044"></a>Train operation and climate change mitigation measures would imply that there should be more electrification of the fill-in project type. My noble friend mentioned 167 miles, which would be a substantial expansion of the electrified network.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000045"></a>I recently travelled to the House on TransPennine Express from Edinburgh to Preston and then on Virgin West Coast to Euston. My whole journey with TransPennine Express was in a diesel-powered Desiro, but wholly under the wires, because the Preston to Manchester section of the line is not electrified yet. How soon can Preston-Manchester and Leeds-York be electrified, along with Sheffield to Doncaster and Ely to Peterborough?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000046"></a>I am very pleased that the Scottish Parliament approved an electrified railway renewal between Airdrie and Bathgate, giving a second 15-minute-interval service between Edinburgh and Glasgow. I hope that the Scottish Government will next electrify the old Edinburgh and Glasgow line, via Falkirk High. At present, the 15-minute-interval service requires eight diesel Turbostars&#151;Class 170s&#151;to be in operation at any one time. That, if anything, is a ripe example of the need for electrification, especially as many of the Turbostars are doubled up.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000047"></a>I hope that the Minister can give us some hope about new carriages, among other things, for they are certainly needed now. I also support the idea that the IEP, the new Intercity Express Programme passenger train, should be electric; it should have a proper set of auto couplers at each end and it should be expected that diesels will be used in the extremities of the network.</p>

<p><a name="08012454000048"></a>As regards the governance of Network Rail, we might like to insist on the directors being examined by Parliament every six months&#151;I throw that in as a wee idea. Finally, when I was looking in the Irish papers just before I came in here, I saw that the Republic of Ireland is setting a good example, advertising a new service of eight trains a day between Dublin and Sligo with brand new trains. It is interesting that by about 1990, Ireland had decided never to invest again in its railway, then tremendously saw the error of its ways, especially bearing in mind that 55 per cent of the population lives in the Dublin area. It had road traffic congestion and emissions issues and is now really expanding the railway again&#151;so much so that I read yesterday that after Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland's passenger rail network was the second most expanding network.</p>
<h5><a name="08012454000083"></a>2.36 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012454000049"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012454000091"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for introducing this Question for Short Debate. Like most noble Lords, I have an interest as I regularly use the train at peak times, so I also see the problems at first hand. I have not heard much today with which to disagree. The noble Lord explained with his usual skill the problems associated with passenger rolling stock. He made interesting observations about diesel tractions and fuel cells possibly replacing diesel. I have to confess that I was not aware of that surprising possible development.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000050"></a>However, the noble Lord&#146;s particular concern was the west coast main line. It is clear that the rail industry is a victim of its own success. Many noble Lords have talked about the problem of passenger numbers exceeding expectations. Of course, that is a nice problem for an industry to have. However, a lot of problems in the industry have been slowly and steadily resolved. Many noble Lords have discussed the remaining difficulties. Much of the rolling stock is now of good quality, although we need to remember that it does not last for ever. I take it that some thought has been given to such matters as mid-life overhaul, life extension programmes or replacement of the stock because, when we get sufficient modern stock in service, the first tranches of post-BR stock could be reaching the end of their planned service life. Can the Minister say roughly what is the rolling stock&#146;s life expectancy?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000051"></a>It is self-evident that rail travel is much more attractive if passengers can nearly always sit down. If they cannot sit down, that is a measure of lack of capacity. Conversely, if they are packed in like sardines, there will be great dissatisfaction and trains will be used only as a last result. Passengers will use their cars instead. One noble Lord mentioned suppressed demand. To me, one of the great advantages of rail travel is the ability to work and, in particular, to read. Therefore, unreliability and standing-room only has a hidden cost, which is a loss of productivity. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, talked of taking one train earlier. Although that strategy will work in the majority of cases, it will have an effect on the productivity of the people taking that strategy, especially business people travelling as part of their work duties.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000052"></a>The noble Lords who spoke before me are much more knowledgeable than I am and nearly all of them mentioned the 1,300 carriages and the rolling stock that are to be procured. Clearly, that is a serious problem. There is no doubt that they are needed, but during my research, I was surprised at the extent to which the Government are directly involved in the procurement. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that the new stock is suitable for any subsequent franchisee; in other words, meeting the problem of residual guarantees. If the Government have to be involved, it is incumbent upon them to ensure that the procurement happens.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000053"></a>I hope that the Minister can claim that the structure and the organisation of the industry are now appropriate. Are they? It is worth remembering that the period of this Government&#146;s stewardship of the rail industry, post-privatisation, is far longer than the stewardship of the previous Conservative Government. Indeed, it has been long enough for the Government to create the Strategic Rail Authority and then to disband it. I anticipate that the Minister will say that the necessary finance is available. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, described some of the procurement problems in his opening comments. If the finance is available, if the structure is right, but there is still uncertain progress, that sounds to me rather like poor leadership, which leads right to the very top of Government.</p>

I reflect that this is probably not a debate that we would have had in these terms had we been discussing these matters some 10 years ago. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has observed, we have to deal with the problem of a rail network that is a victim of its own success. It would be nice to hear noble Lords from the Opposition Benches making it plain that it is a success story more often than they do. Normally it is the role of Conservative politicians to talk down the rail network and our policy successes. They see that as their path to political glory. I also thought, somewhat whimsically, that it was perhaps worth reflecting that more people use the rail network than when the noble Earl's grandfather was the Prime Minister in the 1945-51 Government. That is not something that I thought we would ever be able to boast about.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, talked about many things: vision, or the lack of it, as he saw it; fares; electrification; Virgin west coast rail; short franchises and the need for longer ones; oil prices; and car parking. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, touched on the west coast line, the Pendolino issue and electrification. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, spoke about First Great Western and made much of the need for forward planning and the abilities of the rail companies to manage growth. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, as ever, made a powerful intervention on freight and the value of working internationally and commented on some of the European initiatives. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, talked about problems on the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>west coast line as he experienced them and the welcome rejuvenation of the southern Ireland rail network which, as he says, is fast improving. Of course, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, talked about the need to look at issues like structure and organisation&#151;or not. We have had a fairly wide range of contributions.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000056"></a>I dispute the commentary of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that we lack vision. I think last year's rail White Paper was perhaps one of the most positive statements about the growth and development of our railway in 50 years. In terms of third-party endorsements, it received a fairly warm response. After all, it commits &#163;15 billion worth of funds in public support for the railway in the period 2009-14 and, as such, is a vote of confidence in rail travel. With the tremendous revival of rail, both passenger and freight, clearly the priority is, as the matter before us says, capacity and the need to ensure that we have that capacity over the next planning period.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000057"></a>That is why the Government have made firm, funded commitments to the biggest single increase in capacity for a generation. No one can dispute that. Some &#163;10 billion pounds will be spent specifically on enhancing capacity between 2009 and 2014. These investments will enable the railway to accommodate a further seven years of record growth. One can argue about the size of that growth, but we know it is there, along with the opportunity to expand passenger numbers. We need to meet the demands placed on the network. This will enable the Government to make a start at tackling overcrowding on some of the busiest services and routes.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000058"></a>To deliver the extra capacity the Government will fund an additional 1,300 new carriages for our franchising system. The Department for Transport will be publishing further information on our rolling stock plan in the very near future.</p>

<p><a name="08012454000059"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012454000093"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> We have heard the figure of 1,300 new carriages time and again. When will they start to be ordered?</p>

<p><a name="08012454000060"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08012454000094"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I think I have answered this question before. The orders will roll out this year. As I said, we are about to publish our plan on the rolling stock rollout in the near future.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000061"></a>Passengers on the busiest routes will continue to see capacity increases; for example, extra coaches for the cross-country and east coast services, and more fast services between London Victoria and Brighton in the high peak. There will be major network and station upgrades at Reading and Birmingham New Street. There will be improvements on 150 medium-sized stations, which is a very big programme. The Government are spending &#163;5.5 million to increase capacity by some 50 per cent on the Thameslink service, which, as we all know, is used by millions of people every year.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000062"></a>Then&#151;and I am particularly proud of this&#151;there is the go-ahead for Crossrail, the culmination of a momentous year for British railways, with &#163;16 billion of funding from Government and business. That project, as I am sure all will acknowledge, is of tremendous importance. Last year also saw the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>completion of High Speed 1. That line was on budget and on time. Many of us have now had the opportunity to see the spectacular refurbishment of St Pancras. This is a tremendous period for the new age of the train.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000063"></a>The government plans will result in a network capable of carrying a 22.5 per cent increase in passenger demand by 2014. To put that into perspective, that will equate to 6 billion additional passenger kilometres being accommodated, and it will see 34,000 extra high peak hour passengers into London and 10,000 into other major cities.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000064"></a>We are committed to a growing railway and to tackling issues of capacity. The priority is to increase capacity in order to tackle congestion, and the measures in the rail White Paper and the high level output specification will do that for the foreseeable future. These record levels of investment are set to continue. Having invested substantially in getting the basics right, the Government&#146;s focus must now be on building on that success.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000065"></a>Noble Lords raised a number of issues in questioning aspects of our strategy. I will try to work through some of those, because I believe, as noble Lords do, that these are important issues. The west coast line and the Virgin Pendolino lengthening issue were mentioned. Last November the Department for Transport received an unsolicited proposal from the Virgin Rail Group to procure the lengthening of the existing fleet of Pendolino trains by the end of the current franchise in 2012, which included additional subsidy and further two-year franchises from 2012 to 2014. It is fair to say that the department has analysed this in considerable detail, and it has concluded that Virgin&#146;s proposal provides significantly less value for money compared with the likely outcome of the normal refranchising exercise that is scheduled for completion in 2012. We have to look at the issue of value for money because we have to ensure that the money gets to the right place. The department advised Virgin of its decision on 21 December and we continue to provide further explanation of the analysis on which it was based.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000066"></a>I give the commitment that the department will continue to take the necessary action to ensure provision for the extra capacity on the west coast main line, as envisaged in the 2007 rail White Paper and HLOS. We will talk to the Virgin Rail Group and other operators about how best to get those 1,300 new coaches on to the network in the required timeframe.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, mentioned fares. I do not agree that we are pricing people off the railway. On the contrary, passenger numbers, as we all know, are at record levels and the Government are delivering the investment necessary to accommodate continuing demand in growth. Increases in regulated fares will remain capped until 2014, generally to RPI plus 1 per cent. One has to remember that regulated fares account for 80 per cent of all fares on the network. On unregulated fares, there are excellent bargains to be had, without necessarily having to book months in advance. However, we are committed to making the fare structure simpler, and the Department for Transport is involving Passenger

Our task is to get a balance between the fare payer and the taxpayer, and the increased revenue arising from the increasing passenger numbers will play a large part in the current shift. I do not accept that the railways should be paid for entirely by those who use it&#151;the wider community benefits from rail use, not least through reduced congestion on other modes&#151;but we have to strike a prudent balance between fare payer and taxpayer.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred also to renewing use of disused rail lines&#151;he drew attention particularly to the Lewes-Uckfield line. We have no immediate plans to reopen disused rail lines, although one should never rule that out. The noble Lord made a good case for ensuring that that some of those issues were brought together in considering new franchises, and drew attention to the potential for reopening lines with the Southern franchise coming up for renewal. The Lewes-Uckfield line attracts a lot of attention. Tom Harris met representatives of the Wealden Line Campaign last June and made the commitment that we would listen if a business case could be demonstrated. I understand that Mott MacDonald is doing some work for the local authorities. It will be wise to look at what contribution that line could make if reopened, with particular reference to what it might add to capacity on southern routes.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000069"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to demand increasing faster than government predictions. We have had to make a best estimate. If demand increases more rapidly, the effect will be felt mainly towards the end of the HLOS period, which is seven years away. We have the opportunity to review and adjust plans if demand growth in the mean time suggests that that is necessary.</p>

That is not to say that there are not difficulties from time to time. It is impressive that on some routes there is even faster growth, which we should welcome and seek to take advantage of.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>growth in capacity over the next, shorter period. My noble friend makes a fair and reasonable point. The White Paper, <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System</I>, considers the longer period. That is why we approach the issue with such optimism.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000075"></a>As I am running close to the time for the next debate, I shall take some of the other issues away and ensure that they are covered in correspondence. I was asked one or two specific questions on rolling stock by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. The usual life expectation for rolling stock is 30 to 40 years, which is why First Great Western, in particular&#151;I am sure this will be welcome&#151;is currently refurbishing its high-speed trains to a new and much higher standard.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000076"></a>Points were also raised about car parking and electrification in Scotland. I will duck the electrification question by simply saying that it is a matter for the Scottish Executive&#151;which it is. We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that car parking is important, a point emphasised in the White Paper. I am pleased that Network Rail and Virgin, in particular, are proceeding with expanding car parks on the west coast line. That may well help in adding passenger numbers on that already busy route.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012454000077"></a>I shall go through of the speeches again and check that I have covered most of the points. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for the opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s case for dealing with capacity issues. I am sure we are all delighted with the expansion of the railway network and passenger numbers; it is a welcome problem for the Government to deal with. We can be much more optimistic when looking at the future of rail than could possibly have been imagined 10 or 11 years ago. I am grateful to noble Lords for their interest in and continued attention to these important issues.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000012"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08012485000290"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what action they propose to take in view of the absence of a coroners Bill in the legislative programme.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000013"></a>The noble Baroness said: I was sorry to see no coroners Bill in the gracious Speech, hence I have instigated this debate. A complete overhaul of coroners&#146; services in terms of both infrastructure and legislation is long overdue.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000014"></a>I start with the subject of death certification. Reform of death certification has been recommended by a succession of reports, including the Brodrick report in 1971, the Luce report in 2003 and, most recently, Dame Janet Smith&#146;s report on Harold Shipman.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000015"></a>The cremation certificate system, which requires families to pay a fee, has proven inadequate in detecting patterns of criminal practice and I believe does not detect poor clinical performance or systematic errors in death certification. A better system of scrutiny of all deaths&#151;not just those involving cremation&#151;with built-in statistical analysis  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC172"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is required and is now easily within the competency of an IT programme. It should analyse deaths and certification by doctor, by location of healthcare delivery and by cause&#151;similar to the data from the Prescription Pricing Authority. For example, hospice doctors will of course certify more deaths than GPs but high numbers from one service, wherever that service is in healthcare, that lie outside the normative curve could at least be spotted.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000016"></a>As for determining the cause of death, it seems that the coroner should be able to pursue a diagnosis beyond an immediate &#147;mode&#148; of death and to obtain a precise diagnosis by further pathological investigation for the benefit of a family and also for the benefit of the healthcare system.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80124-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000017"></a>There is a need for authoritative guidance to coroners and pathologists on exactly what a coroner&#146;s post-mortem should achieve. To exclude unnatural causes of death is far too simplistic. Fewer and fewer non-coroners&#146; post-mortems are being done, so verification of the precise medical cause of death is happening less and less, yet it is essential for an audit of clinical services to improve patient safety. Furthermore, it is unclear what level of investigation is justified&#151;and lawful&#151;once unnatural causes have been excluded. Perhaps I may give an example. A patient with mesothelioma dies at home. Because the illness is related to asbestos, this results in a police interrogation of the bereaved family, even though the diagnosis has been clearly established. That is an unnecessary and hurtful consequence of current regulations. If we had a chief coroner, that could be completely avoided.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000018"></a>Another example is that, currently, if a patient dies with a dementia syndrome, a coroner is not motivated to establish the cause of the dementia&#151;an expensive procedure costing around &#163;600&#151;even though the family may wish it. Therefore, if it happens at all, a research programme might pick it up as a by-product of the family agreeing to donate the brain for further research. However, dementia represents an increasing cost to the public purse, so the underlying causes need to be known if we are even to plan spending in the future.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000019"></a>Sometimes information might prevent a premature death. I was recently told of a case of sudden adult cardiac death where the strong suspicion was of an inherited cardiomyopathy. A coroner&#146;s post-mortem was done but, despite having the consent of the relatives, the coroner refused to pay for appropriate specialist investigation of the heart, with genetic testing, because it was clear that the death was due to natural causes. The coroner had neither remit nor resources to undertake investigations for the benefit of the relatives. The NHS then also refused to pay because the test would be for the benefit of the relatives, not the deceased, and the deceased came from a different primary care trust from the relatives. Yet such investigations would have clarified future management of the close relatives and could have lowered their risk of sudden death.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000020"></a>Why is complex, controversial and expensive legislative change to medical revalidation being pushed with greater vigour than legislation to permit  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>improvements in the investigation of death? A draft Coroners Bill was announced for this Session, published, then dropped. That is unjustifiable.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000021"></a>I shall move on to the provision of medical advice. The draft Bill, as previously published, emphasised legal aspects, but the medical aspects of ascertaining a cause of death are key to accuracy and require expertise. Surely it is the medically qualified specialist pathologist who should have the ability to pursue the appropriate investigations and dictate how to examine the body, rather than the coroner, who often is not medically qualified at all.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000022"></a>Nowhere is that more important than in the vexed issue of sudden and unexpected death in infants. The report by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, into that subject recommended that tissue blocks and slides should be retained in perpetuity after a post-mortem examination in a case of sudden infant death syndrome, in case future developments justified re-examination of those samples. When we debated the Human Tissue Bill, I stressed the need to be able to revisit the specimens but the Government did not accept that. Now retention is illegal without &#147;appropriate consent&#148; once the work of the coroner has been completed. If the parent had been culpable, of course they would want to ensure that all tissue was cremated and all evidence destroyed. If not, then in the horrible and unthinkable event of a second cot death, the tissues could be re-examined.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000023"></a>The situation in Scotland is exactly the opposite to that in England and Wales because, under the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act, the blocks and slides become part of the deceased&#146;s medical record and the pathologist is specifically prohibited from disposing of them or returning them to the parents. That polar difference between Scottish and English law is contrary to the stated intention that the tissue legislation between the two jurisdictions should have broadly the same effect.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, also recommended that certain time-sensitive samples, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid and nasal swabs for microbiological investigation, should be taken as soon as possible after the death of the child has been confirmed to maximise the chances of ascertaining fully and reliably the cause of death. She clearly anticipated that this testing would take place in accident and emergency departments before transfer to a mortuary. However, the Human Tissue Act 2004 has made such sampling illegal, except where the A&amp;E department has a Human Tissue Authority licence to undertake such sampling&#151;but there is cost and complexity to obtaining such a licence. The Royal College of Pathologists believes that this was an oversight and that this consequence of the Human Tissue Act was not recognised prior to Royal Assent. A coroners Bill could easily correct that anomaly.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000025"></a>Why do we need a chief coroner? We need a national structure to ensure consistency of standards and to ensure that the investigation of deaths is carried out to a gold standard nationally. I have already mentioned the problem of mesothelioma, which could be easily solved if we had a chief coroner. The current law has to be ignored when it comes to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC174"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>setting a gold standard. We have a shortage of highly specialised paediatric pathologists, so the bodies of dead children are being transported great distances for post-mortem examination. This is a serious issue because the law as it stands states that a body can be transported only to the adjoining coronial area of jurisdiction. When a family has to deal with the sudden death of a child, they must know that a satisfactory post-mortem has been carried out&#151;and carried out within the law. The Ministry of Justice is aware of the problem, but everyone turns a blind eye to the benefit of the bereaved.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000026"></a>It is time that the needs of the bereaved, particularly their need for information, were properly addressed. Pathologists undertaking coroners&#146; post-mortems must know the wishes of the relatives before the post-mortem starts in order to be able to respect them, not simply consult them later. Relatives need information. I should like to see them have a copy of the pathologist&#146;s report interpreted for them as a routine, with a copy to the GP so that they can ask questions later.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000027"></a>After Alder Hey, the University Hospital of Wales established a group, similar to the groups established in hospitals up and down the country, to take inquiries about tissue samples and retained tissues. When the family were not satisfied with the first-line response team, a few of us gave one-hour appointments for relatives to ask questions and tried to allay their concerns. The overriding factor was that they wanted answers. One woman said to me that she had waited 15 years to understand why her daughter had died. In that hour, I finally gave her the answers.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000028"></a>That situation cannot be allowed to continue. The charter for the bereaved lays out important guidance. I hope that it will not be abandoned now that the responsible ministry has changed. The legislative changes must be underpinned by organisational changes and clarification of funding. The &#147;who pays&#148; issues are now working increasingly against good practice. The Department of Health consultation on death certification in pandemic flu mentions reforms, but when are they coming? Until we modernise the coronial system we risk denying justice to our dead and their bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000030"></a>We, too, were disappointed that the coroners Bill was not in the Queen&#146;s Speech. We had hoped that it would be because there were a number of issues that we needed to bring forward. We now have a situation where service personnel are being killed in operations&#151;that is not new, but the numbers are new in our times&#151;and members of the dead personnel&#146;s families are having to wait a long time for the inquests to take place and may have to travel long distances to attend when they do. There are also a number of other issues.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000031"></a>We had a meeting with the Minister at the Ministry of Defence. I know that this subject does not strictly  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC175"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>come under its remit but, nevertheless, understandably the Armed Forces look to the MoD to assist them with their issues and problems. We hoped we were going to carry on and discuss the coroners Bill. That is no longer there for us to discuss but we cannot leave matters as they are. I know that there has been additional funding and that in the past year the backlog has reduced, but there is still a substantial backlog of inquests to be heard. Can the Minister give an indication of what the Government are going to do in this area?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000032"></a>There are a number of problems. It seems obvious that the inquest should take place in the area where the deceased&#146;s family live&#151;it would be better for them and more convenient&#151;but that may not always be the right way of doing it because of a shortage of expertise. Local coroners may deal with a military death only once in their whole career and there needs to be some expertise. We believe that, for the different reasons that have been mentioned, that expertise could be gathered and made available under a chief coroner.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000033"></a>Multiple-death cases will still be heard in Oxfordshire because the aeroplanes bringing the bodies back go into Lyneham, with Swindon and Wiltshire also involved. There have been cases where a deceased&#146;s home is in Scotland and the family has had to travel from there. That cannot be the best thing. On the other hand, if people with the relevant expertise are not available to go to Scotland to carry out the inquest, it may be the only answer. We would welcome a debate on the delay and where the inquest is to be carried out.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000034"></a>There is also the issue of legal representation at the inquest for the families. These personnel have been killed on Her Majesty&#146;s business and we believe that the state has a responsibility to assist their families.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000035"></a>In my view, looking at the backlog, at what has happened and at reports in the press, one of the most heart-rending aspects is the lack of transparency and lack of information. Families are told that there is a delay or that the inquest will not be heard yet. Also, families do not have the detail to which, in our view, they are entitled. Transparency and information are absolutely key. If we had had a Bill, that would probably have formed the basis of an amendment.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000036"></a>Costs are a problem for families. These families do not have huge incomes and, at a time of huge trauma and stress for them, they then have to find travel costs. I know that they can apply for travel costs, but the system needs to be much more upfront and proactive in the way that the families are looked after. It is possible to do that because the Armed Forces&#146; welfare services are very good and very well developed, but perhaps we could ensure that their concerns for families in the services extend also to those who are faced with a member of the family who has paid the ultimate price in performing their duty to their country. That would certainly be of great assistance.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000037"></a>A whole range of issues could have been aired in a very healthy and straightforward way had we had a Bill. I confess that I am not absolutely sure where we take these issues now. I am not making a special pleading to the Minister, but I ask the Government  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for a joined-up approach, with the Ministry of Justice and the MoD coming together. We would certainly welcome meetings about this because we feel that we have made a little progress. The additional legal resource put in has helped to reduce some of the backlog but it is by no means anywhere near enough. I am sure that neither the Government nor we want this issue to continue to make headlines in the press, as it does from time to time. We would welcome an indication from the Minister that the Government are prepared to take this forward, even if we do not have a Bill, to see what can be done to improve the situation for families who have lost their loved ones. They have paid the ultimate price in serving their country.</p>

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, I too am disappointed that there was no coroners Bill for very similar reasons: military inquests and delay.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000039"></a>I served in headquarters, 1 (UK) Armoured Division, between March and May 2003. We recorded several fatalities arising from operations, and I know the details very well. Of course, there is no need to go into those details or to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to them&#151;particularly the problems of the current system. However, it was not until three years after the events that inquests were held, which had a very serious effect on the families. Clearly, there was no way the widows could restart their social lives prior to the conclusion of the inquests, so they could not achieve closure on the disaster in their lives for years. Of course, that was no doubt to the delight of the solicitors&#146; profession.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000040"></a>In my opinion, there are other serious problems related to inquests arising from military operations. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, talked about transparency and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in her submission on different issues, talked about the need for the families to have transparency and to understand what went wrong. I think she was talking about a situation in which the family found out what went wrong 15 years later. The MoD is very poor at telling families what happened in a frank manner. It is very difficult to do but it is poor at that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000041"></a>In the past, repatriation, especially from operations, was rare because it was impractical. We can do it now, but we did not in the past. I think that it was a court case in the 1980s, some time after the Falklands campaign, which determined the need for inquests. During the Cold War, there were very few operational casualties. If World War 3 had occurred, the need for inquests would have been the least of our problems.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000042"></a>I do not know the answer to these problems but I know that they are very sensitive. I urge the Minister to give inquests arising from military operations urgent and careful attention.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my early years as a solicitor, the head of my firm, Mr Maurice Evans, was Her Majesty&#146;s Coroner for Denbighshire. In that capacity, he presided in 1938 over the inquest into the Gresford colliery disaster of 1934, when 264 miners lost their lives. The mine was sealed and none of the bodies was recovered. At that inquest, the miners&#146; union was represented by Sir Stafford Cripps QC and the coal owners by Sir Hartley Shawcross QC. Your Lordships will appreciate that, with lawyers of that standing, very serious consideration was given to the issues. All that happened was that the mine manager was prosecuted for destroying the records of the condition of the mine prior to the explosion. &#147;The Ballad of the Gresford Disaster&#148; recalls:</p>
&#147;The fireman&#146;s reports all are missing The records of 42 daysThe colliery manager had them destroyed to cover his criminal ways. Down there in the dark they are lyingThey died for nine shillings a dayThey worked out their shift and now they must lieIn the darkness until judgement day&#148;.
<p><a name="08012485000244"></a>My noble friend Lord Hooson tells me that he went with my late father-in-law down the shaft and was shown where the miners had been bricked in.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000044"></a>In my day, the part-time coroner, my partner, was on his own. His staff consisted of his secretary, and there was no other support. Inquests were held in any convenient court room. I am not sure how his fees were paid&#151;I think that it was probably by the local authority. Funding varied, and still varies, all over the country.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000045"></a>Nothing has changed. The terms of reference and the procedure remain the same. I recall the frustrations of appearing for grieving families but being denied, under the procedure, any right to address the coroner or his jury on the verdict. My role was confined simply to cross-examining the witnesses, and, of course, there was no legal aid. I shall be interested to see whether my colleague, Mr Michael Mansfield, is able to address Lord Justice Baker at the termination of the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales and what he will say if he is not allowed to do so. So far as I am aware, the system has not changed over these years.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000046"></a>It was Dame Janet Smith, in her inquiry into the Shipman murders to which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred, who pointed out how archaic and ramshackle the system of coroners had become in this country. To be fair, I say that the Government took up the cause, admitting that the current inquests system was failing. Harriet Harman told Members of Parliament back in February 2006 that the system was archaic and said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000258"></a>&#147;Under the current coroner service, families frequently get overlooked during the inquest process. There is nowhere for them to turn when they think that something is going wrong; there is no complaints system. The system is fragmented, with no national leadership&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 6/2/06;  col. 607.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000245"></a>She said that the changes that she was proposing would give families the right to contribute to coroners&#146; investigations. Those were very fine words but, although a draft Bill followed, there has not been a great deal of action since.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000047"></a>Since that statement was made, we have seen problems, to which previous speakers have referred, with inordinate delays in inquests into the deaths of servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan. The coroners for Oxfordshire and Wiltshire were unable to cope with the numbers and others had to be drafted in.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000048"></a>Another area of equal concern is the deaths of vulnerable people in custody. In some of those cases, there have been delays of up to three years. Again, so far as I am aware, the same limitations on legal aid and representation persist.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000049"></a>The proposals that the Government put forward in their draft Bill for a service of full-time coroners were heavily criticised in the report of the Constitutional Affairs Committee published on 1 August 2006. Crucially, the committee found, first, that the limitations of the local structure of the current system gave rise to an uneven distribution of resources, and under the draft Bill that would remain. It also called on the Government to address the problems of under-resourcing in the existing system in order to create solid foundations on which reforms could be built. It asked the Government to reform the structure of the coronial system by creating a national service with centralised and adequate funding so that all coroners would be able to work to the same high standards.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000050"></a>Another recommendation of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred, was a charter for bereaved people. However, the Constitutional Affairs Committee noted that the,</p>
<ul><a name="08012485000267"></a>&#147;raised expectations of the bereaved may lead to severe disappointment in circumstances where serious under-resourcing and, therefore, variable standards in service are likely to persist as a result of inadequate funding for reform of the coronial system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000246"></a>Its final point was about public health and safety. It recommended that the Government took a,</p>
<ul><a name="08012485000268"></a>&#147;bolder approach to reform of the coronial system, embodying in legislation an enhanced role in relation to public health and safety&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000247"></a>It is a matter of significant concern that there should be proper funds to carry out the recommendations that a coroner makes at the conclusion of an inquest. </p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000051"></a>The matter was discussed when the coroners Bill was dropped from the Queen&#146;s Speech. Your Lordships will recall that it had been mentioned in the series of measures announced in the mini-Queen&#146;s Speech in July. Then, the coroners Bill was promised but that promise was simply not fulfilled. In the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech, my noble friend Lord Dholakia expressed his anger that the coroners Bill was not included, and he referred to the problems that I have already mentioned. He stressed:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000259"></a>&#147;We need the introduction of a system for monitoring inquest verdicts and statutory obligations on public bodies to respond to the findings of an inquest&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/11/07; col. 273.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000248"></a>One problem is that a coroner makes recommendations but, unfortunately, they do not carry sufficient weight to be carried out by the public bodies to which the recommendations are addressed.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000052"></a>The problems in relation to families were very well summarised by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, who in that same debate said that, by delaying the introduction of the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08012485000269"></a>&#147;the Government are acting directly against those whose cause they claim to champion; namely, victims, and in this case their own victims&#151;the relatives of those who have died in custody&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/11/07; col. 316.]</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000249"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, have pointed out today, it is a scandal that families are left for such a long time before they learn about the circumstances in which their loved ones died in combat.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000053"></a>I am glad that it is the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who is to respond because he assured the House in that debate that the Government remained committed to reform and that the Bill had been deferred rather than abandoned. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000260"></a>&#147;We will look to see what can be done in the mean time to strengthen the coroner process&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/11/07; col. 336.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000250"></a>I am not aware that any steps have been taken to strengthen the coroner process since we debated the matter last November, but I shall be interested to hear whether there are any plans in hand.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000054"></a>We are anxious that this archaic system, which does not comply with so many modern standards of justice, should be thoroughly and properly reformed, that adequate resources are put into it, and in particular that the recommendations of coroners should be followed through as they were in relation to the inquest held in 1938 into the Gresford colliery disaster.</p>

We owe her a considerable debt. My enthusiasm for legislation on coroners is tempered by the contents of the Government&#146;s draft Bill, published in June 2006; and I hope that when at last the Government do introduce this matter into the Queen&#146;s Speech, they will have thought again about aligning the legislation with their March 2004 position paper.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80124-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000056"></a>As a number of noble Lords have said, the issue of coroners&#146; reform has been with us for a long time, ever since the Brodrick report. It is true that the Government have taken a number of initiatives in the last seven or eight years. In 2000, there was a Home Office review of death certification, and the then Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, set up a fundamental and independent review of coroners&#146; services under Mr Tom Luce, who found that the system was not fit for purpose. In July 2003, we had the third report of the Shipman inquiry, which also recommended serious reform; the Government position paper with proposals for reform was published in March 2004.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000057"></a>I must say that I am really astonished that the draft Bill of 2006 does not deal with the most important issue of all, which is that of aligning death certification with the coronial system. It will always be hard to forget the appalling evil of Dr Shipman.  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC180"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The consequences of that were very well put by Dame Janet Smith in her foreword to the third report. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000261"></a>&#147;In the First Report of the Shipman Inquiry I disclosed my finding that Shipman had killed at least 215 of his patients over a period of 24 years. It was clear that the current arrangements for death registration, cremation certification and coronial investigation in England and Wales had failed both to deter Shipman from killing his patients and to detect his crimes after they had been committed. The failure of the existing system prompted Parliament to set up the Shipman Inquiry&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000251"></a>Later she goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000262"></a>&#147;If there is a risk that a doctor might kill in the future and if, as is now clear, the present system would neither deter nor detect such conduct, surely the system must be changed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000058"></a>A year later, in March 2004, the Government brought forward their position paper with proposals for reform. That paper quite rightly sought to integrate the death certification system with the coronial system. In the future, every time a death occurred, what followed from that death would immediately be within the purview of the coronial system and proper checks would be made on the doctor&#146;s certification of death. It is amazing to think that of the more than 200 people who died under Dr Shipman&#146;s care, not a single one of those was double-checked by a medical practitioner. It is also the case that the 2004 position paper proposed not just a centralised system for reform of the structure of the coronial service, but also a centralised system for financing it.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000059"></a>But the draft Bill contains neither of these things. Given what Dame Janet Smith said, how can the Government possibly justify not integrating the death certification system with the coronial system? It bewilders me because Dame Janet Smith has put us on notice that unless there is that integration, then another Shipman could strike, or even more than just one. I therefore ask the Minister: what is the justification for this? What happened between March 2004 and June 2006 that made the Government change their mind on this issue&#151;in flagrant breach of what Dame Janet Smith said? She looked at this issue in depth over a long period of time, is better informed than anyone else in the country, and thus in a much better position to make a judgment. The Government initially accepted what she said, but then subsequently spurned it.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000060"></a>I share in the views of those who have spoken before me, and I would particularly like to underline the contributions of the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, and my noble friend Lord Attlee. This is a terrible human problem, but it is one that would be so easy to resolve through legislation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000061"></a>I hope the Government have taken that on board. Although I want to see legislation on this matter as quickly as possible, I do not want to see just any old legislation. I want to see legislation which confronts the human problems as well as confronting the real dangers to our society. It seems that this draft Bill does not meet either test, and I hope that when the Government do legislation, they will have thought again about these issues.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC181"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="08012485000276"></a>3.38 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000062"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012485000295"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> First, I thank the noble Baroness for allowing us to debate what is clearly a very important matter. I can assure noble Lords that in responding to the points that have been made, our debate will be invaluable in assisting the Government in thinking through the further changes that will be necessary. I can give an assurance that we will pay close attention to the substantive points that have been raised. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, illustrated graphically the importance of the inquest and the coronial process, and I agree strongly with him about that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000063"></a>On the question of legislation, as I said in our debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech, I deeply regret that we have not been able to find legislative time, but I want to confirm again that the Government remain committed to legislation in this area. Naturally, I cannot go further than that in terms of exactly when, but I want to reassure noble Lords that we see this as a very important measure. Obviously, we are looking at ways of bringing it forward at the earliest possible stage.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000064"></a>Although imperfections have been identified in the current system, Dame Janet&#146;s report, the Tom Luce report, other reports, the Select Committee and, very importantly, families, have raised issues of concern, I want to place on record the Government&#146;s thanks to all those in the current system for the work that they do. Of course we can do better.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000065"></a>The legislative reform to which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in particular, referred, attempts to do a number of things: first, to put families at the heart of the inquest process; secondly, to have a chief coroner to set national standards, to hear appeals, to improve training arrangements and to oversee the operation of a statutory charter for the bereaved. It aims to give flexibility in the system to transfer cases easily from one area to another, if it is in the interest of families to do so; to begin the process towards the formation of a predominantly full-time group of coroners, completely focused on coronial duties, rather than the large part-time group that we have at the moment; to improve medical expertise available to the service with a new national medical adviser to work with the chief coroner and to provide better advice available locally. In a moment, I will describe to the Committee what can be done in the absence of legislation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000066"></a>On the question of the inter-relationship and links between the coronial system and death certification, that is of course vital. We are working with other government departments, not least the Department of Health, as it develops parallel proposals on reform of the death certification system. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that, although there has been a development of ideas since Dame Janet's report, we want to ensure that the respective work in my department and that of the Department of Health closely inter-relates.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000067"></a>On medical certification, I make a number of comments. First, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the proposal that all deaths should be  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reported to the coronial service. We are not taking that forward. We believe that to have all deaths reported to the coronial service would not be an effective response in targeting resource where the risk is greatest. I want to respond later to the specific question of delays. We also think that such a system could bring unnecessary delay to families wishing to proceed quickly with funeral arrangements. The focus under the proposals and the changes that the Department of Health has made on control of drugs&#151;it is also consulting on the better regulation of doctors&#151;will, we believe, reduce the likelihood of a Shipman operating undetected in future.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000068"></a>More generally, the single system of effective medical scrutiny applicable to all deaths will be of great assistance there. The work of the Department of Health on certification will bring obvious benefits, including better quality and accuracy in the certifying of deaths and improved local public health monitoring more generally. The proposals will also tackle the lack of independent scrutiny in the system, which was so ruthlessly exploited by Harold Shipman. I assure noble Lords that we are working very closely with the Department of Health in this matter.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000069"></a>Since I was responsible for this area in the Department of Health last year, and gave evidence to the Select Committee, I should say that we are working very hard together to make sure that we match the work of both departments and that there is integration of approach.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000070"></a>What are the non-legislative changes that we can introduce in advance of legislation? First, subject to the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice, there are some changes we can make to the current coroners&#146; rules, which we are already working on. I refer particularly to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, concerning the coroner&#146;s duty to report to an organisation to take action to prevent future deaths. We want to improve that system. He has identified some of the current weaknesses in it. We want to make the process much more transparent. </p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000071"></a>Organisations will for the first time have a requirement to respond. In the absence of a chief coroner, my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor will oversee the reports made and responses to them. He will bring them to the attention of ministerial colleagues and, when appropriate, to Parliament. I say to the noble Lord that as a Minister at the Department of Health, I received such reports from time to time and we responded to them. I felt that, while it was not always right to respond immediately to the recommendations made by individual coroners, that could be an extremely useful part of the process in terms of reassuring families that lessons are being learnt and taken account of by public organisations, as well as demonstrating ways in which government departments may need to look at weaknesses in systems that have been identified in individual inquests.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000072"></a>We are also planning to introduce a new rule to ensure that coroners and local safeguarding children boards have the correct framework to work together effectively with their respective responsibilities to investigate child deaths, again making sure that there  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC183"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is close collaboration and that some of the current loopholes and gaps are identified and dealt with. I also assure noble Lords that we will work closely with coroners to consider any other changes to the rules that will enable them to carry out more effective investigations and inquests, or that would lead otherwise to better services for families.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000073"></a>The Department of Health is piloting its plans for medical examiners. As part of those pilots we can see whether the list of deaths we have drawn up to guide doctors in their referrals is effective and helpful. Modifications can be made in the light of experience. We believe that too many cases are referred to coroners that they ought not to receive, while they do not receive some that they should. This is the first time that the definitive list of deaths has been drawn up for national dissemination, and it is intended that it will eventually become statutory guidance on the implementation of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000074"></a>We are working with the Press Complaints Commission to review its code of conduct in the reporting of inquests. Clearly, we do not intend to prevent inquests being reported; however, we want all steps to be taken to ensure that they are reported sensitively. Some inquests provide very good copy to editors, but we want to encourage editors to give some more thought to the impact that will have on the lives of surviving family members, not least any children concerned.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000075"></a>A number of noble Lords have mentioned the charter for the bereaved. We will be issuing that for further consultation. It will contain the minimum services that families are likely to receive in the future, and we will be working with coroners and their officers to establish what service improvements they can offer to the bereaved within the existing system&#151;particularly when it comes to the timely provision of information; I take the point that was made about that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000076"></a>I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, made some very important points, particularly on post mortems. As, by necessity, post mortems have to be carried out as soon after death as is practical, it is important that procedures are in place to ensure that the next of kin of the deceased person can be properly informed and consulted. In addition, there will be in legislation appeal rights to the chief coroner if a coroner chooses not to order a post-mortem or a particular type of specialist examination. We think that that will provide a safeguard for families who want to know whether the death of a loved one has been caused by a genetic defect that can be treated in other family members if the problem is diagnosed sufficiently early.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000077"></a>We are also working with the Royal College of Pathologists and the Department of Health to ensure the most effective post-mortem system. I accept the noble Baroness&#146;s point that this presents some considerable challenges. I was the Minister concerned with Alder Hey some years ago. I shall never forget that time and, in particular, meeting the families who suffered so grievously from the way in which the organs were retained. As the noble Baroness knows, some families went through the trauma of at least  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>three burials when new body parts were discovered. That, of course, led to the Redfern report and then legislation in the form of the Human Tissue Act 2004. </p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000078"></a>The noble Baroness referred to a number of issues that were raised in that Act, particularly in relation to keeping material in perpetuity. At the time, we took the view that the compulsory retention of tissue could not be justified in circumstances where the coroner had fulfilled the coroner&#146;s function. I am sure that it will be a disappointment to the noble Baroness when I say that we have not moved from that position. She mentioned Scotland, but clearly that is a matter for Scotland. We feel that the view that we took with the Human Tissue Act was the right one and it was endorsed by Parliament.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000079"></a>I shall need to come on to the question of military inquests but perhaps I may respond quickly to a very important question raised by the noble Baroness on post-mortems on children, and babies in particular. I well understand the problem of the shortage in particular specialties, and the Department of Health is working very hard with the royal college to see what can be done. It remains a challenge and I would never seek to deny that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000080"></a>I very much agree with all the comments that noble Lords have made about information given to families. In taking through reform of the system, we will emphasise the critical importance of information being made available to families as early as possible.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000081"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Dean, who raised, on behalf of the War Widows Association, very important matters in relation to military inquests. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for whom we have enormous respect, also has much knowledge of these matters. I assure noble Lords that my department works, and liaises closely, with the Ministry of Defence to ensure that inquests into the deaths of our courageous service personnel are held as promptly as possible. I am well aware of the trauma that the delays have caused to their families. A total of 144 inquests have been held since the conflicts began in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000082"></a>I shall come on to funding generally in a moment, but we have made additional funding available to both the Oxfordshire and Wiltshire coroners. I believe that good progress has been made, although I accept that there are still a number of issues concerning the transfer of single deaths to coroners closer to the next of kin. Of course, we want to ensure that that happens wherever possible.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000083"></a>I understand the cost implications for families. The Government will pay overnight expenses to enable two family members to attend any pre-inquest hearings which may take place, as well as the inquest itself. On the more general point of support to families, I agree with my noble friend about the teams. We have established a dedicated team within the Ministry of Defence to improve liaison between boards of inquiry investigators and coroners.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000084"></a>On the question of legal aid, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will understand that because the procedures are inquisitorial, legal aid is not provided as of right, but families may be provided with legal aid for those inquests if they meet the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary criteria. Several families have been assisted. The Legal Services Commission considers these matters, and if it believes exceptional funding should be made, it comes to me as the Minister concerned at the Ministry of Justice. I assure the noble Lord that I take this matter very seriously and give it careful consideration.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000085"></a>Some of the reasons for the delays in military inquests are because of the military boards of inquiry. Special investigations have to take place in the field; they also have to be listed on dates that suit the families. All that aside, though, I well understand the need for us to do everything we can to help the coronial service keep those delays to a minimum. My officials are in weekly contact with the coroners who are handling these inquests to check progress in this matter and to give what assistance we can. My right honourable friend Harriet Harman, who had the responsibility for this, has taken part in a number of meetings with families in this area, and I hope that that will continue.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000086"></a>On the question of specialist coroners or a centre of excellence for military inquests, which my noble friend raised, we do not support that idea. We think it might even create a backlog of inquests and increase the time&#151;and, indeed, the distress to bereaved families&#151;by requiring more families to travel further to their inquest. We have to ensure that all coroners, wherever they are in the country, are able to handle those inquests. As my noble friend will know, a number of inquests have been held outwith both Oxfordshire and Wiltshire and we believe they have been handled effectively and quickly. However, I will keep a close eye on that matter.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000087"></a>I shall finish with a comment about resources. This is a local service. We think there is sufficient resource within local authorities&#146; budgets, but the Select Committee thought there should be a mechanism for auditing the expenditure and it is our intention that the chief coroner will indeed look at comparisons of expenditure. We are not moving to a national service, however, so it must be a matter of local discretion. I defend that; it is perfectly possible to maintain a local service but with the benefit of a chief coroner to ensure that there is auditing in order to establish that every coroner is carrying out their responsibility effectively. It is better to have that kind of national leadership but local provision.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000088"></a>I have taken a lot of time because this is an important matter. I hope that at the very least I have assured your Lordships that we are keen to proceed with legislation. I cannot guarantee when that will be, but I give a guarantee that we will look at all the other issues that noble Lords have raised.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000092"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012485000298"></a>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what assessment they have made of the development of the Central American Integration System.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000093"></a>The noble Viscount said: I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to raise this subject. I am particularly glad that the proposal to hold short debates in this Chamber has now come to fruition. This is a rather specialised subject, which has been on the Order Paper for a year, but one has to be patient&#151;now things will move forward. I am grateful to the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, as he has just come hotfoot from a gruelling five-hour debate on Iraq and we now discuss a more specialised area, central America. It is quite clear that it is a specialised area because there are more diplomatic representatives attending the debate than there are speakers, which says something in itself.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000094"></a>I shall start with the history. In 1951, the Organization of Central American States under the acronym ODECA&#151;Latin Americans like acronyms&#151;came into existence comprising the five countries of central America: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In 1960, there was the creation of the Central American Common Market generally known at the time as CACOM. That was a time of considerable difficulty. I was living in El Salvador for two years working on a start-up operation for a multinational company. As it was a start-up operation, I had the opportunity to visit all the countries in central America, together with Panama and Mexico. It is interesting that all those countries are now grouped together under one Minister in the House of Commons, Meg Munn.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000095"></a>It was a difficult time. With the exception of Costa Rica, democracy was not well established. There were frequent military interventions, much centralised control and that sort of system of economic management was still in vogue, as against market forces. Gradually things changed and changed for the better, with the advent of democracy and peace in the region, which was very welcome.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000096"></a>In 1991, ODECA was changed into SICA, which started formally in 1993 with Panama as a full member. SICA&#151;in Spanish, Sistema de la Integracin Centroamericana&#151;is an institutional framework for regional integration of the countries concerned. It was an extremely good idea. As small countries need to work together to have a voice, this was a good move forward. Now the total membership of SICA comprises some 40 million inhabitants, providing a much stronger voice than the individual countries. Belize, the smallest country in the region, joined in 2000 as a full member and the Dominican Republic joined later as an associate member. The presidency rotates every six months and the executive arm of the SICA organisation is in El Salvador.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000097"></a>One has to remember&#151;this applies to the whole of Latin America&#151;that all those countries are quite different culturally, temperamentally and, in the case  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Guatemala and Belize, in particular, are ethnically diverse with large indigenous groups. The problems facing each country are, to a certain extent, different, but they have formed this organisation to work together for a common cause.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80124-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000098"></a>The European Union takes the area very seriously. In 2003-04, an EU dialogue started with central America. The EU now has an ambassador in Nicaragua and a charg&#233; d&#146;affaire in all other countries. Formal association negotiations, which are ongoing, concerned trade, technical co-operation, aid, and so on. That is a hugely ambitious project and worthy of our full support.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000099"></a>I have concentrated briefly on the political background, the history of the area and trade and economic issues. The noble Baronesses who will follow will tackle other aspects, such as cultural relations and aid. Today we have had a Written Statement on the subject of what DfID is doing in Latin America. That is very welcome and I know that they will comment on it in detail. As I have no right of reply, I am extremely grateful to them for participating in the debate.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000100"></a>However, earlier this year, the Foreign Secretary wrote an article, which I read, under the headline,</p>
<ul><a name="08012485000270"></a>&#147;Stand by for our diplomatic surge&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000252"></a>I am doing so, with some expectation and a little hope. However, Latin America and central America, in particular, have suffered exactly the reverse. There have been drastic cuts in our diplomatic representation. Three embassies, those of Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, were closed and there have been other cuts in the size and influence of other embassies. As a result, we have lost influence, especially in such subjects as garnering votes in the UN, and other matters. Where do we go? That is the big problem. In my view, direct contact in what the Foreign Secretary said about our global reach should mean what it says.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000101"></a>For instance, as I found when I lived in Latin America, personal contact is what it is all about. We may have trade policies decided by the EU, but trade policies do not produce business and investment deals for Britain. From my perspective, we are looking strictly at the British angle. Our diplomatic representatives here are doing the same on a true bilateral basis. You need to have representation on the ground in order to do business. However much know-how you may have, what matters in Latin America is &#147;know who&#148;&#151;direct personal contact with people on the ground. You can do that only through representation and embassies. I suggest that what has happened in many cases is that where our European continental competitors&#151;in many cases, we are competing in business matters&#151;have embassies, they do the business and we do not. They have a bigger coverage than we do.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000102"></a>In a previous debate, I suggested that we might reinstate mini-embassies, one-man bands reporting to larger embassies. That has been tried in the past extremely successfully. With the development of electronic communication, it should be possible to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve that, especially as the security risks are much reduced from what they were, if not eliminated altogether.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000103"></a>I hope that that will happen but I have to say that I am not totally encouraged by what the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown is likely to say. As I said at the beginning, I am extremely grateful to him for being here. Although it is not his portfolio, he has been very active. I fear that he will not necessarily agree with what I have said, but I live in hope that he will give us some encouragement that we will return to the area with full vigour in due course.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000278"></a>4.09 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000104"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012485000299"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I start by paying tribute to the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery of Alamein, for his unstinting interest in the region and the way he keeps these issues before Parliament, and indeed for all the work he does outside the Chamber in the form of networking, encouraging us to meet ambassadors, his membership of all-party groups and so on. Without the efforts of the noble Viscount and those of the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, central America could have been overlooked on many occasions. A primary difficulty is that the region is often squeezed out of discussions between North and South America. However, as I have learnt over the past few years, it is a vital region in its own right, extremely interesting and certainly very dynamic.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000105"></a>I was particularly pleased with the announcement today by DfID, which encompasses all of Latin America, recognising the fact that if a country is described as being a middle income state, that does not necessarily mean that it does not need aid. I am glad that Nicaragua has been highlighted, because of its particular circumstances, which the Minister may touch on, and the extension of aid, even though it will become a middle income state this year.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000106"></a>While researching the issues for this debate, I looked at the GDP of each of the countries. As I went through the various websites, the estimates of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office appeared to vary enormously from those given on American websites. The Americans usually seem to regard the GDP of these nations as being around twice as much as we do. One example I can cite is that the FCO estimates the income per capita for Guatemala at $1,790 a year, whereas the Americans estimate it at $5,400. It may be that my research is wrong, but there seems to be a vast discrepancy for all of these countries. It would be interesting to find out whether the Americans and the FCO are calculating the figures differently. It is important to have accurate information. I do not question the figures of the FCO, and perhaps would be more ready to query those given on American websites.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000107"></a>In the time available, I want to reflect on my observations drawn in part during my own visits to two central American countries. In the past two years I have had the pleasure of visiting Costa Rica and Nicaragua for holidays, and I am shortly about to visit Belize and Guatemala for the same purpose. Last year I was also lucky enough to join the IPU

I see that the noble Lord, Lord Rea, is in his place; he, too, was a member of the delegation. During the visit to El Salvador we had the pleasure of being able to look around the SICA secretariat and to be given a snapshot view of its work. It is a vital organisation, as it is able to achieve valuable economies of scale for its members. Indeed, there is a parallel between the way the European Union works for its member countries and how SICA works for central America.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000108"></a>I would be particularly interested in the Minister&#146;s observations on the use of EU structural funds. Coming from the West Country, I am acutely aware of how useful they have been to the area. How does the Minister envisage SICA developing its own structural funding programme, which is something I know very little about?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000109"></a>I shall touch on my own experience as a tourist in those countries, as they are still incredibly undervalued by those of us from Europe as a tourist destination. I am pleased that, in parliamentary terms, the Latin American Travel Association will hold its annual reception, either next week or the week after.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000110"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012485000300"></a>Viscount Montgomery of Alamein:</b> The reception is next Tuesday evening. While I am on the subject, we had a conference in Canning House earlier on central American tourism, which was a great success. I should have mentioned that the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, apologises for not being here; she is in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000111"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012485000301"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I thank the noble Lord for getting the date absolutely right. Central America is a wonderful tourist destination. If I list just a few of the things I found interesting, it might be a bit of an indulgence on my part to remember what a great time I had, but it will also highlight what is of particular interest: the mix of culture and environment, wonderful Mayan remains and unparalleled birdwatching opportunities. The noble Lord, Lord Rea, has much greater expertise in that last area than I do, but one of the pleasures was that from our hotel room we could look out and see a huge variety of birds. One of the most memorable trips with my husband was to the estuary of the San Jos&#233; river near Jac in Costa Rica, where, absolutely effortlessly, we saw more herons than I knew existed. Another highlight was horse riding through the Nicaraguan highlands.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000112"></a>We experienced Estel, where the nearby national park had got a co-operative going so that you could go into the office and book your accommodation, your meals and, for example, your horse riding or a guided walking tour; you paid in one go and they organised everything for you. It was a model of how to use a national park, which had grown up from the way that the farmers had worked in a co-operative way in the past. It was the most interesting three days that it was possible to have. We saw a bit of the agriculture and some of the history. If my Spanish had been a lot better, I would have got much more out of it. One of the things I am doing at the moment is trying to learn more Spanish.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000113"></a>We particularly enjoyed the historic towns of Len and Granada. There is an awful lot for tourists to do, and the development of tourism, especially high-quality ecotourism, is an exciting possibility.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000114"></a>The parliamentary delegation of the IPU was very short because we had just two or three days in each of the two countries, so it was very much a snapshot, with presentations on human rights and justice issues, education, healthcare and infrastructure. In the short time we were able to spend outside the conference rooms seeing what was happening, the devastating effects of weather&#151;hurricanes and mudslides&#151;destroying infrastructure as soon as it is built were quite apparent. But so was the resilience of the people; for example, the drive for education.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000115"></a>There was a great deal to be optimistic about, as well as a great deal that the EU and the UK could help with. I am glad that the Home Office has done some of the training of the police force out there. Some countries there feel that the questions of impunity and justice are a difficult challenge.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000116"></a>The final important issue that I want to touch on is biodiversity. During the climate change debate, we have recognised the matter of deforestation and the value of forests as carbon sinks. There are enormous problems. It was highlighted to us, for example, that the illegal logging in Guatemala and the logs being taken out from Mexico are very difficult to police. A UN biosphere crosses the borders between Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, so it is particularly interesting. </p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000117"></a>Many of the countries have national parks. There is some mileage in considering whether there should be a greater link between UK and central American national parks. It could be an exciting partnership.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000118"></a>My final question concerns the difficult issue of President Ortega&#146;s recent outlawing of abortion in Nicaragua. It is likely to lead to abortion tourism, with women going over the borders to seek abortion elsewhere, or to drive abortion underground, which we know is dangerous. What representations has the Minister made on that issue?</p>

<p><a name="08012485000120"></a>It is rare that any time is spent considering this region of the world; it is not often mentioned in the media; and the dismally few Members of Your Lordships&#146; House participating today is a sad indication that this lack of interest extends to Parliament, too.

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000121"></a>The low international profile of these countries has had a stultifying effect on many initiatives. It is clear that, unlike other regional trading blocks, such as Mercosur and NAFTA, SICA has not yet got off the ground.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000122"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, said that he hoped that the Government would do everything that they can to help the development of the political, economic and social integration necessary for the achievement of the association agreement between Europe and central America. The association agreement, and the free trade area that is part and parcel of it, will, we hope, be a great help to those countries and their future development. The establishment of strong democratic institutions, a sound economy and social cohesion will benefit not only central America but Europe. The lack of them has contributed to the region becoming an important transit route for South American drugs, and has stultified the potential for international trade.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000123"></a>Of course, greater attention to this region does not have to be confined to economic and political help. It is encouraging to see that the Government are involved with the British Council&#146;s Peacekeeping English Project that started in Guatemala in 2007. We hope that they keep up the levels of support necessary for the project to be extended throughout the region.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000124"></a>We were pleased to learn from the DfID statement today that the Government are increasing their financial support to Latin America by 15 per cent, which will be provided through NGOs. Will the Minister tell us which NGOs and in which countries?</p>

<p><a name="08012485000125"></a>However, I draw attention, as I have in previous debates, to the worrying inclination of this Government to reduce our diplomatic presence around the world. I am shocked that figures are no longer available for the diplomatic budget in the annual accounts. Reductions are noticeable particularly in regions such as central America: there is now no resident British diplomatic representation in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. How does the Minister expect initiatives such as the Peacekeeping English Project to succeed in countries without a diplomatic presence? How does he expect to build stronger links or a &#147;hub&#148;, as the Foreign Secretary now calls bridges, with citizens in those countries when neither a British embassy nor a British Council office is present? That is not to mention our loss of important influence on votes in the United Nations. Does the Minister really feel that our country&#146;s interests are equally well promoted through European institutions? Where would he advise a British citizen in trouble in Nicaragua to turn?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000126"></a>The GDP figures mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, are interesting. The one I found most fascinating was the disparity between Costa Rica and all the other countries in the area. It is so much higher mainly because it has concentrated on education and health and has spent nothing on defence, unlike the others.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000127"></a>These debates on international development and foreign affairs so often highlight the brilliant work being done to increase links between far-flung regions with this country and the great benefits that those connections bring to all concerned. I thank the Minister for being here today to answer this debate, after a gruelling time on Iraq earlier.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000128"></a>How will these relationships continue to grow when this Government, representing the fourth largest economy in the world, valuing their warrant of holding global influence, insist on pulling back the very institutions through which they are established in the first place?</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000280"></a>4.26 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000129"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012485000303"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> I, too, congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, on introducing this debate. I thank him for his continued engagement and interest in central America. For those who are historically challenged, I suspect that many may wonder whether Alamein is a hacienda in central America, rather than a battlefield in north Africa.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000130"></a>First, a word about the formal subject of the debate, the Central American Integration System, SICA, which was established in 1993 and has been an important framework for the countries of that region to come together to discuss shared concerns and act as a single voice on important international issues. SICA member countries share many common aims and concerns. They have trading links, in many cases a rich shared culture and history, and common challenges, such as climate change, drugs and crime, inequality and governance problems, including human rights, to which I will return.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000131"></a>SICA institutions are still developing. Although some have their problems, it is an important platform for outsiders, such as ourselves and our European partners, to discuss the serious issues which concern us and the central American Governments. SICA is therefore an important and useful tool in our diplomatic work in the region. For example, Carlos Guerrero, president of the Central American Sustainable Development Commission and Environment Minister of El Salvador, will visit London in February. We will discuss our priorities for a post-Kyoto agreement on climate change with him and those messages will then be shared across the region.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000132"></a>Let me just say a word on the issue of post closures, which I somehow suspected would come up today, because we have two speakers who have very properly kept this issue firmly in front of the House.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000133"></a>Since the White Paper in December 2003, the FCO continues to review its overseas network to ensure we are deploying our limited resources in line with our priorities, so that we can respond to change as those priorities change and make sure that we are providing the best possible value for money. Sadly, that resulted in the closure of posts in San Salvador, Tegucigalpa and Managua from within the central American region. A decision to close a post is never taken lightly. The global character of our diplomatic network is an important asset for this country, and we want to maintain and enhance it. But priorities change, and we have to reflect that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000134"></a>We do not have to be too long-faced about this. We still maintain five sovereign posts in the SICA countries: Guatemala, Costa Rica, Belize, Panama and the Dominican Republic. The countries that no longer have their own dedicated posts are covered from other countries and our staff make regular visits  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC193"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to them. Ministers and officials in London have regular contact with officials and politicians from Central America and we have appointed honorary consuls&#151;which is not quite the same as mini embassies; nevertheless, they help us to provide continued consular cover, enable us to discuss important issues and ensure that we protect British interests. Above all, they represent value for money.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000135"></a>Noble Lords have raised today&#146;s Statement and the news that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has announced an increase in development funding for Latin America and for Central America. I am pleased to confirm that financial assistance to Latin America will increase by 15 per cent from &#163;84 million in 2007-08 to &#163;97 million in 2010-11. However, as part of the overall strategy of ensuring that the resources are used most efficiently, that increase in programme resources is accompanied by the closure of DfID offices in Nicaragua and Bolivia. As Nicaragua becomes a middle income country in 2008, funding will be switched from the Government to other channels such as NGOs.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000136"></a>We have determined that the best way to deliver development support as a whole is on a regional level with an emphasis on trying to do all that we can through partners such as the EU, the World Bank and international NGOs. As the increase has just been announced, I am in no position to say which NGOs will be involved. That will be a bidding process, a programme development and a competitive process going forward. I stress that this is not disengagement, but a way of providing the support most effectively. The World Bank and the EU are big users of the structural funds to which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred in her experience of the West Country and development&#151;we can call them programmatic rather than just project funds, and budget support funds as well. We are trying to give countries the chance to make their own spending decisions and not be micromanaged through the project funding approaches of the past.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000137"></a>On our position on the Nicaraguan Government and therapeutic abortion, the UK is concerned about human rights violations wherever they occur. Officials from the British embassy in Costa Rica work very closely with DfID as well as with human rights organisations in Nicaragua and other EU embassies, to address human rights concerns, including therapeutic abortion. The EU raised the issue with the head of the Nicaraguan Parliament in late 2006. The budget support group, which deals with the structural funds in Nicaragua, of which we are one of nine members, has repeatedly raised the issue as one that contravenes the fundamental principle of human rights.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000138"></a>I thank noble Lords for the interest that they have shown in this part of the world. I acknowledge the presence of our diplomatic colleagues from the countries of the region and assure everyone that the Government remain committed to a global foreign policy, which includes the central American region. It is important to us for investment, trade, human rights, development, climate change and many other issues  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC194"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we have in common with the countries of that region. We maintain friendly and close links with all the countries on a bilateral basis as well as through the EU and SICA, the central American integration system that we discussed. We simply do not believe that the most efficient way of maintaining this relationship is an embassy in every capital.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000139"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08012485000304"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> I should like to ask the Minister a quick question. We welcome the increased money from DfID, but Foreign and Commonwealth Office representations are being reduced, and that illustrates exactly what we have said repeatedly. Is this another example showing that the Government are increasingly less interested in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office?</p>

<p><a name="08012485000140"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012485000305"></a>Lord Malloch-Brown:</b> As noble Lords know, the Government have made a commitment to increase development assistance to meet their objective of achieving 0.7 per cent of GDP in aid, and that has been endorsed and supported in a statesmanlike way by the Opposition. Given that, DfID has received a generous settlement in the spending plans for the coming three years. I am relieved to say that the Foreign Office also did better in terms of its programmatic resources than has been the case in recent years, thus securing an increase in support for our key priorities. But both DfID and the Foreign Office, like all other government departments, have been given a ceiling for their so-called administrative expenditures, which is what they spend on personnel. In that sense, there is no difference between the two departments because this is a Whitehall-wide cost control measure that affects us all. I fear that it reflects more clearly the tight purse, or perhaps tight fist, of Whitehall rather than any loss of support for the Foreign Office itself. I hope very much that the Foreign Office under my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is enjoying a renaissance with its new strategy, Refresh, and its new priorities. The noble Baroness should not be too concerned.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000141"></a>Living within an envelope of tight resources means that we shall continue to have to make decisions about how we can most efficiently manage our relationships across small countries in ways that meet both their and our agendas without sustaining unreasonable administrative costs in the form of lots of London-based staff being sent away to take up what may be inefficiently small posts across the region.</p>

In the past there were plenty of internecine strifes in Whitehall with the Department of Trade and so on. Would the Minister like to consider taking the DfID money and getting the Foreign Office to administer it? That would have a direct effect because we do have diplomatic representation in some of these countries, although not all of them. With that human contact, the diplomats would know exactly which departments the money should go to and for what. Instead of putting

I know that we cannot do that at the moment, but we shall continue to struggle for them. The noble Lord might like to consider that suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000143"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012485000307"></a>Lord Malloch-Brown:</b> The noble Viscount is correct to say that many of us feel that we need to do a better job of, as it were, branding our development assistance so that people know about the extraordinary and growing generosity of Britain in the area of humanitarian and development assistance. The use of NGO partners will help in that to a certain extent, and when money goes through the World Bank or the EU, we should encourage our colleagues at DfID to ensure that the funds are better identified as British support. That is because a lot of money will be distributed through trust funds and other activities identified to aid particular sectors or regions. There are opportunities to pursue that.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000144"></a>More generally, however, I would say that reports of differences of view within Whitehall are always exaggerated&#151;we agree on everything, of course. While the noble Viscount may not believe that, I suspect that he will certainly believe that attractive though it might be&#151;no doubt he saw a gleam in my eye at the notion of hijacking DfID resources&#151;it would be quite beyond my Whitehall political and banditry skills.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000148"></a>In the year following the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, we must not forget that, although the slave trade was criminalised, it has never been abolished. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000263"></a>&#147;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000254"></a>Yet, more than half a century after these landmark documents, and 200 years after the efforts of William Wilberforce and his friends, the modern-day slave trade, including human trafficking, flourishes.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000149"></a>The US State Department estimates that someone is being deceived or coerced into exploitation by trafficking across borders every single minute, and that 27 million men, women and children are still suffering from trafficking and other forms of slavery. That is why we can welcome the launch last year of the UN&#146;s Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking and the Vienna Forum next month, which aim to provide a multi-stakeholder global framework for action against human trafficking. Through raising awareness and assisting in the fight against all forms of trafficking and enslavement anywhere in the world, every individual and every Government has an obligation to take a stand against these evils.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000150"></a>I ask the Minister: what part will Her Majesty&#146;s Government play in the Vienna Forum, and what concrete action will be taken as a result to protect the victims, prosecute the traffickers and prevent illegal trade in people? Will the Government ensure that civil society organisations such as Stop the Traffik will play a key and integrated part both in this initiative and in their own work, and that the experiences of young people, in particular, will inform how human trafficking is tackled?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000151"></a>The input of young people is crucial because the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are at least 5.7 million children in forced and bonded labour; 300,000 forcibly recruited into armed conflict; and 1.8 million in prostitution and pornography. These are just some of the horrible situations into which over 1 million children around the world are trafficked every year. Every 30 seconds while we are debating here this afternoon, another child is forced or tricked into slavery: the 25,000 children trafficked into the so-called Lord&#146;s Resistance Army in Uganda, the girls trafficked into prostitution in Thailand, the children trafficked into slave labour in India and the 70,000 boys forced to become child soldiers in Burma are just a fraction of the indescribable toll of man-made suffering.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000152"></a>But individual stories speak more eloquently than statistics. Last Wednesday I was in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan talking to a young man who had just escaped from 20 years of slavery. He still bears the scars&#151;some visible, such as the slash on his skull and the amputated finger; others invisible, such as the taunts and not being allowed to go with other children in the family to the school or the mosque. He is just one of thousands of African men, women and children abducted by Arab northerners in Sudan in their war against the Africans of the south and the marginalised areas.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000153"></a>Thousands are still missing. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government pressure Khartoum to accept responsibility for the slavery it is known to have promoted and to take all appropriate measures to identify, free and return to their homes all who have suffered enslavement at their hands?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000154"></a>A few months ago I was talking to young people in northern Uganda who had suffered indescribable horrors  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC197"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>after capture by the LRA. Tortured and brutalised, they were forced to kill each other and to fight against the Ugandan Army and their own people. I will never forget speaking to a young teenage girl who was forced to kill another child with a panga knife and drink his blood&#151;she still has nightmares&#151;or a young teenage boy forced to cut another boy to pieces and who learnt that, after he escaped, the LRA killed his father in reprisal. The testimonies from young people who have suffered trafficking and enslavement are legion.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000155"></a>One aspect of our everyday lives that is affected is chocolate. Nearly half the chocolate we eat in this country comes from Cote d&#146;Ivoire in west Africa; the ILO estimates that over 200,000 children are trapped in forced labour on cocoa plantations there. Many of these have been trafficked in from neighbouring countries such as Mali, imprisoned, tortured and forced to pick and carry cocoa beans all day, every day. The major chocolate companies do not deny this and cannot guarantee that the products they profit from have not been made by trafficked child slaves. This is completely unacceptable. The cocoa industry must implement Stop the Traffik&#146;s &#147;traffic-free chocolate&#148; pledge. It must pledge transparency in its supply chains, no tolerance towards any child labour, better pricing for producers and rehabilitation of children rescued from such dire situations. Will the Government urge leading organisations in the cocoa industry to fulfil the obligations they made to eliminate the worst forms of child labour from their supply chains and to implement farm-level certification and independent inspections to verify this?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000156"></a>However, these are not just distant problems; they are happening right here, right now, on our own doorsteps. Last year the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre conducted a scoping project on child trafficking in the United Kingdom, identifying 330 children from 44 countries who were probable victims of trafficking. They were brought by air, sea and rail into heinous work such as cannabis cultivation, benefit fraud and forced begging. Yet, despite such reports, the full extent of human trafficking in our own country remains unknown. Will the Government support my efforts to establish a Royal Commission to investigate modern-day slavery and to propose means for its abolition?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000157"></a>I welcome the Government&#146;s announcement last week that they will accelerate the implementation and the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, but will they publish a schedule for implementation and a date for ratification? I also welcome the Government&#146;s announcement that they will review their reservation to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Will the Government act promptly to remove this reservation which denies child victims of trafficking their basic rights?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000158"></a>Why do the Government refuse to appoint an anti-trafficking national rapporteur, who would have the power to collect information, investigate cases, report to the Government and make recommendations? This is a recommendation of the Council of Europe and is already successful, for example, in the Netherlands. Establishing such a post would provide more resources,

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000159"></a>I commend the work of campaigns such as Stop the Traffik, which are working with over 900 partners in 50 countries to raise awareness, advocacy and resources for the fight against human trafficking. They are working with grassroots organisations to remove the root causes, including some of the millennium development goals such as poverty, lack of education and gender inequality. Will the Government consistently insert anti-trafficking strategies into poverty reduction programmes such as the multilateral poverty reduction strategy and their bilateral country assistance plans? Will they also raise awareness of the links between the millennium development goals and human trafficking?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000160"></a>The Government can also do more to tackle trafficking in Europe. Thousands of young women are being trafficked from the former Soviet Union to the United Kingdom, where they are repeatedly raped whilst in sexual enslavement in many brothels in our towns and cities. I commend the work of local community action groups such as Croydon Community Against Trafficking, which is working with local newspapers, police officers and councillors to rid its town of modern-day slavery. But action is also needed at regional and national levels. Will the Government support current moves to establish a Europe-wide single number hotline for victims of human trafficking, connected to existing national services in each country?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000161"></a>I have tried to outline some policies that could bring an end to human trafficking and the modern-day slave trade. These could be implemented both by this Government and by others at the Vienna Forum. I hope that all the questions I have raised will be answered and not ignored, as happened to some in last week&#146;s debate on human trafficking in the other place. Only if the Government take the kinds of initiatives identified by organisations such as Stop the Traffik will there be any hope of stopping the trafficking and enslavement of human beings.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000162"></a>I fervently hope that, following the year in which we celebrated the achievements of William Wilberforce and his co-abolitionists, this year will not be a year of condemnation of our failure to do all we can to achieve the goal for which they have strived, so far in vain: the abolition of the slave trade and all forms of human trafficking.</p>

We have been trying to tackle it at source because the enlargement process of the European Union has brought trafficking not only onto our doorstep but right inside the house. It is a shameful thing to have to confess to noble Lords today that one of the new members of the European Union&#151;Bulgaria&#151;only outlawed human trafficking just before entering the European Union. We did have a greater success with Romania, which outlawed it considerably earlier, but it has made us investigate much more closely legal provisions to block trafficking. I am very happy to say that, after negotiations with the head of the Duma, Russia has now outlawed trafficking. Implementation of the law is the next step&#151;but if you do not have the law in place you have nothing to hang on to at all.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000166"></a>Therefore I believe profoundly, and would like to put on record again, that tackling this problem in the source countries may be the only real solution. Getting the right laws in place and training the police is important. That is why Her Majesty&#146;s Government nominate police to go abroad to those countries where the traffickers are using people as commodities for sale. Ultimately, if we can possibly trap at the beginning the perpetrators of this terrible crime, we will save so much human misery it is hardly true.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000167"></a>This means that we will have to work hard on capacity building, institution building, the rule of law and strengthening democracy. The heart of democracy is human rights and human dignity; slavery is the antithesis of human dignity and human rights. On top of that we must work in the field of family and public health; mother/child healthcare is a very strong tool in this. Very often the young are trafficked because they are the easiest to transport and move around, and they raise the most money. They can be trafficked for involuntary organ transplants, for example. You can make half-a-million dollars if you have quite a small child and you can plunder the entirety of its body.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000168"></a>So it is very important to think about the rule of law, training the police, the magistrates and the judges and getting Parliament behind the whole situation positively and powerfully. We managed to stop many thousands of children and young people being trafficked from Romania by dint of getting the Government, the president and the Parliament not only to pass the right laws but to believe profoundly that they had to protect their people and not have them used as commodities.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000169"></a>When you look at it on the ground you will see that the trafficking springs up locally; then these clusters of traffickers group nationally; then the international traffickers move in, and after that you have almost no defence at all. So you have to pin this down at the very beginning.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000170"></a>I have been working hard with my colleagues in the European Parliament and through a charitable effort we established the Children&#146;s High Level Group with J K Rowling&#151;the voice of the children globally. We beg and hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will think beyond our shores. They could assist not only by dealing with the problems of trafficked people here

<p><a name="08012485000171"></a>I congratulate the noble Baroness once more and look forward to her further work.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000282"></a>5.14 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000172"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08012485000312"></a>Baroness Goudie:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for calling this very important debate today on the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking which is taking place in Vienna next month. I was pleased to be invited to launch this very important initiative in the House of Lords in March last year with Antonio Maria Costa, the executive director, Julia Ormond, the United Nations goodwill ambassador and our Minister, Vernon Coaker, who is responsible for human trafficking issues at the Home Office and who has helped us enormously over the past months.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000173"></a>The Vienna forum is calling for action to raise awareness and to facilitate co-operation and partnerships among the various stakeholders. The forum will allow for an open environment to enable all parties involved to take concrete steps to fight human trafficking within their spheres of action. It will be a catalyst for solution-seeking ideas and will address the overriding themes of human trafficking. Vulnerability&#151;why does human trafficking happen? Impact&#151;the human and social consequences of human trafficking. Action&#151;innovative approaches to solving complex problems.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000174"></a>Human trafficking is a crime that shames us all. It is a booming international trade making billions of pounds and is the third largest industry next to arms and drugs. The World Bank will confirm my figures on that. In the other place, Mr Steen asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department,</p>
<ul><a name="08012485000271"></a>&#147;how much money has been confiscated from criminals convicted of trafficking people in the UK in each of the last three years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000255"></a>Earlier this week, the Minister, Mr. Coaker, answered:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000265"></a>&#147;The total value of confiscation orders and cash forfeiture orders made in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland over the last three years against criminals involved in people trafficking is set out in the table&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons; 22/1/08;  col. 1866W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000256"></a>The figures are quite low but wait until you get to the last one. I have rounded the figures up. In 2004-05, the value was &#163;400,000; in 2005-06, it was &#163;1 million; in 2006-07, it was &#163;2,500,000.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000175"></a>Criminals profit while satisfying consumer demand. That is why we should ratify the Council of Europe&#146;s Convention against Human Trafficking and take a lead. Great Britain is a destination country which, I am ashamed to say, is one of the highest receivers of victims. Many victims are children, who are being robbed of their dignity and freedom. Trafficked victims are vulnerable to poverty and exploited by traffickers, who use force and deception to trap their prey. Victims include young girls sold by their families; children drugged and forced to fight as soldiers; men bonded and chained in labour mines and farms; women enslaved in quarries and households; women and girls trapped in the sex trade;  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and boys forced to fish in dangerous waters. These human beings are being forced to do what others would never freely do and are paid virtually nothing for their pains. They are used like disposable products for commercial gain. I repeat, they are disposable products&#151;the traffickers have no feelings about human beings. I ask the Government to send to the forum a delegation of the highest level, led by a Cabinet Minister.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000176"></a>Finally, let me quote my friend and colleague Melanne Verveer, co-founder and chair of Vital Voices Global Partnership. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012485000266"></a>&#147;Governments, businesses, NGOs and citizens everywhere have a responsibility to work together to address this modern-day slavery. The new initiative will be critical to progress in combating this global challenge. We urge everyone to join the 21st century anti-trafficking movement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012485000257"></a>I am looking forward to being with my colleagues from the Government in Vienna. I will be attending as a member of the Women's Leadership Council and in my capacity as a board member of Vital Voices Global Partnership.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000283"></a>5.19 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000177"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08012485000313"></a>Lord Watson of Invergowrie:</b> I, too, pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for sponsoring this debate. Her activities in combating contemporary slavery are well known and well-documented. To her fine words, she has added fine actions, which is never a simple or easy thing to achieve.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000178"></a>It is estimated that as many as three-quarters of a million people are being illegally trafficked across international borders every year. Global awareness of that evil trade is, I am pleased to say, growing, but the level of knowledge remains very low, which increases the vulnerability of potential victims.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000179"></a>All too often it is assumed that human trafficking primarily involves vulnerable women or girls from poor countries being duped into coming to developed countries such as the UK, and then having their passport taken away while they are forced, often by threats or the actual use of physical violence, to work as prostitutes. That assumption is wrong on two counts. First, although the plight of women or girls trafficked for sexual purposes is dreadful, it is not the case that such women constitute a majority of victims. Secondly, it is by no means only in the developed world that vulnerable people are coerced into activities that amount to no less than modern-day slavery. The International Labour Organisation, the UN agency charged with addressing labour standards, employment and social protection issues, estimates that at any time more than 12 million people are in forced labour, bonded labour or sexual servitude&#151;there are many forms of this. As the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, said, the one thing that these people have in common is that they are human beings, coerced into a situation that they would never voluntarily have entered into.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000180"></a>These crimes are widespread, affecting people across many countries, yet here in the UK there is no shortage of nefarious activity involving lives from which people seemingly have no escape. If a reminder was required of what slavery means in Britain in 2008,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it has been provided, with perhaps uncanny timing, by the front page of tonight&#146;s London <I>Evening Standard</I> under the banner headline, &#147;Police Free the London Child Slaves&#148;. If we read that, we see that &#147;slave&#148; children who were smuggled into Britain by traffickers and forced to steal and beg on the streets of London have been freed. Police raided a string of houses, each of which held up to 10 children, to seize traffickers whose trade is said to be worth up to  &#163;1 billion every year. More than 20 people were arrested as officers freed the children, who had been sold to Romanian people-smuggling gangs and forced into a life of crime. Police estimate that each child is worth as much as &#163;100,000 a year to the gangs, and the Romanian authorities estimate that up to 2,000 Romanian children have been smuggled into Britain to operate as modern-day Oliver Twists.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80124-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000181"></a>The Metropolitan Police has its own dedicated team to tackle human trafficking, of course, and the ACPO-led UK Human Trafficking Centre in Sheffield further demonstrates the efforts that are being made to tackle these crimes. The operation that is reported in the paper today involved the Met working closely with its Romanian counterparts, which is a welcome development. For too long this country was not able to work as effectively as it might have done with other European countries because the Government had not signed the Council of Europe convention against trafficking. Last year, they did sign up to it, although as yet it has not been ratified. Many EU member states will ratify it and bring it into force next month. I hope that the Minister will clarify the Government&#146;s position and set out their intentions, which I also hope will include a date for ratification.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000182"></a>As I said, awareness of human trafficking is increasing. Last year, the Church of Scotland, in marking the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade, introduced a campaign pack on tackling human trafficking and called on the Government to ratify and act on the convention. The church had been urged to campaign on the issue by its missionary partners around the world. When asked what one issue they thought the Church of Scotland should take up in order to improve the lives of people in their countries, the most common response was combating human trafficking.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000183"></a>This is not, of course, an issue that can be fought in any one country, which is why the UN established the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, or GIFT, in March last year. The Vienna forum next month will be the first opportunity to review GIFT&#146;s aims and to begin to co-ordinate activity to counter the increase in human trafficking. I note from the forum&#146;s programme that over three days there are to be more than 20 sessions on topics as varied as criminal justice responses, the roles of employers&#146; organisations and trade unions, repatriation and reintegration of victims, supply chain management and the role of the media. I hope that the Government&#146;s representatives in Vienna will return with a list of actions on which to follow up, so that the pernicious activities of human traffickers can be reduced and eventually, I hope, eliminated.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC203"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="08012485000284"></a>5.23 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000184"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012485000314"></a>Baroness Thomas of Walliswood:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has brought an extremely important subject before us today and I join my voice with those of earlier speakers who expressed their concern and horror at the worldwide extent of the abominable practice of human trafficking, particularly the trafficking of women and children. The ending of this appalling trade in people, which the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, rightly described as modern slavery, should be the goal of every democratic country, although it will be achieved only through collaboration with other like-minded states.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000185"></a>One has only to recall the bare statistics. US authorities estimated in 2005 that 800,000 people worldwide were trafficked every year and that the annual revenue from that trafficking amounted to about $9.5 billion. The market in the UK this year is estimated to be worth about &#163;1 billion, rather more than a quarter of which is accounted for by the market in sexual exploitation. Tonight&#146;s news, brought to us by the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, emphasises the importance and size of this trade and the power of the people who run it. No doubt many powerful people will resist the end of this lucrative trade. We will have to fight them as well as fight for the right actions on behalf of our Government.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000186"></a>In 2003, some 4,000 people were trafficked into the UK for the purposes of prostitution. Whereas 10 years ago some 15 per cent of women prostitutes were from abroad, now only 15 per cent are of domestic origin. Women and children constitute a large proportion of those trafficked, many of them coming from some of the poorest countries in the world&#151;in many cases countries benefiting from more or less generous funding from the United Nations and/or other donor nations, including the UK. The Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, is directed to actions which the UK Government could take to help eliminate this terrible modern form of slavery.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000187"></a>It is a matter of concern that the Government have only just committed themselves to the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Clearly, where the better management of border controls is involved, it is of the greatest importance to maximise co-operation, not only between EU member states but also with other states within our continent. Will the Government commit themselves to working effectively with other European states in order to monitor this trade, track the traffickers, intercept their deliveries and bring them to justice? Without that collaboration, we will not get very far at the European level.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000188"></a>Will the Government also improve services for trafficked adults and, particularly, children who have escaped their so-called employers? Adoption of services for these victims is another requirement of the convention. In particular, do the Government now accept the need to appoint guardians of &#147;rescued&#148; trafficked children? After all, the EU reception direction, the EC convention and UNICEF guidelines all propose this as an essential part of the care for trafficked children.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC204"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000189"></a>My second area of inquiry is in relation to the interrelationship, if any, between the fact that many trafficked persons come from the poorest countries and that these are the same countries which receive large subventions from the UK or other states. It may be asking too much to require these countries to close their borders to the &#147;export&#148; of human beings by the traffickers. Furthermore, some of the destination countries are themselves among the poorest countries on the globe. Is there any pressure we can bring to bear, at least on those countries not at war, to persuade or assist their governments to begin to institute effective control against traffickers?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000190"></a>Finally, will the Government be able to put forward proposals at Vienna which might increase determined, world-wide collaboration among the richer nations directed towards the ending of this terrible practice? The countries of the developed world form a major market for the men, women and children who are victims of this terrible trade. Is it not the duty of &#147;consumer&#148; countries to do their best, both inside and outside their own boundaries, to end this modern slavery?</p>

I believe that Her Majesty&#146;s Government should be congratulated on what they have done so far about trafficking into Britain. More is needed, of course, and I do have some questions to put. When will the Government ratify the UN protocol on the trafficking of children, which was signed as long ago as 2000? Will they make any necessary legal changes using the current Children and Young Persons Bill? Further, will they sign the Council of Europe convention protecting children and adults against sexual exploitation and abuse? Will they remove their reservation of nationality and immigration from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000192"></a>Will they study the cases of Paul Gadd and Paul Bower, and close the three-day loophole allowing British registered sex offenders to make short visits overseas without notification? Will they seek to make extradition treaties with foreign countries, especially in south-east Asia, wherever these do not now exist? Will they reconvene the expert working group on information and intelligence concerning paedophiles and sex tourism? Will they ensure that they have high-level representation at the UN Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, taking place in Vienna next month?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000193"></a>Turning to domestic matters, can they give preliminary details about Operation Pentameter 2? That is designed to free those forced into prostitution and to arrest traffickers and pimps. I hope that may be possible. Are they satisfied that there are now sufficient safe houses to accommodate trafficked persons once they have been freed? Such houses are necessary in most parts of Britain. Can they report progress in identifying trafficked children at ports of entry and in preventing such children disappearing from the care of social services?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000194"></a>Finally, like my noble friend Lady Cox, who mentioned this, will they consider appointing a rapporteur on human trafficking, reporting to Parliament, as well as, or instead of, the existing ministerial working group? People who have been trafficked deserve respect and care, and do not deserve to be treated as illegal migrants. I hope that my questions have illustrated how much more there is to be done. It is of paramount importance that all agencies involved work closely together. Surely that is something that only the Government are capable of organising.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000286"></a>5.32 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000195"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012485000316"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, on securing this debate. It seeks to highlight the problem of this vile trade. I feel very strongly about the subject but, in view of the constraints of time, I am not able to talk about this abhorrent practice in great detail.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000196"></a>I am horrified at what is described as modern-day slavery. Human trafficking involves deception, intimidation, coercion and exploitation. Criminality is at the centre of this trade. Estimates suggest that the global trade now exceeds &#163;9.5 billion and around 80 per cent of those involved are women, of whom about half are minors. The Government have estimated that more than 4,000 women are being trafficked into this country for sexual exploitation. The United Nations has estimated that up to 2 million women and children are trafficked across international borders every year. A recent UNICEF report found that, in an 18-month period, 330 children were believed to have been trafficked into the United Kingdom and that, of these, 183 went missing from the care of social services. That is appalling and shameful. Yet, in 2005, only 166 people were sentenced to immediate custody under the variety of offences that constitute people trafficking. We need to ensure that more people are detected and convicted of this disgusting behaviour. Those involved need to be taught that they will not be able to get away with their crimes.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000197"></a>I am pleased to note that the Government have indicated that they will ratify the Council of Europe convention during the coming year. I should be most grateful if the Minister would confirm that this will be included in legislation during the current Session, so that the actual ratification can take place by the end of the year. It would also be helpful if the Minister would confirm that, from the moment the convention is ratified, the Government will abide by all the requirements contained in it.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000198"></a>A simpler approach might include implementing separate interviews for women and children travelling into this country with people who are not family members. That has been suggested by my party but it has not been well received by the Government. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain what action the Government are taking to increase the practical co-operation between national authorities to tackle human trafficking. I support the proposals for the establishment of a border police force, which would be able to focus more consistently, effectively making Operation Pentameter a permanent operation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000199"></a>Human trafficking should be regarded as a mainstream police priority. At present, there are areas where nothing effective is done by the police. I want to see more people prosecuted and convicted, thereby sending out a signal that we mean business in tackling human trafficking. We need to be able to help victims. I would like to see an increase in the number of safe houses, maximising the number of places available to victims in safe accommodation and ensuring that capacity is used efficiently. Those under 18 years of age are excluded from accessing the POPPY project&#146;s facilities, which should be changed. Perhaps a helpline for victims would help promulgate information for those who have suffered or are suffering. I hope that we will have another chance to hear from the Minister after the Vienna forum, and that real progress will at last be made.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000200"></a>There is abuse also of workers who enter this country legally or illegally. It is imperative that the activities of rogue gangmasters are controlled. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

I suggest that the best way of maintaining and improving the co-operation that already exists is for regular progress reports to be made on the implementation of the Government&#146;s action plan, so that questions such as those that we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, would need not to be asked in a gathering of this kind, but would automatically be available to all your Lordships and the public.</p>

As my noble friend Lady Nicholson said, we ought to deal with problems in the countries of origin as well as at home. I congratulate her on her work in bringing the standards of new members of the European Union up to the level of all the rest. We should consider, if we do not do so already, appointing airline liaison officers in Bucharest, for example&#151;even though Romania is part of the European Union&#151;because that has proved effective in other places from which illegal activities have stemmed in the past.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000204"></a>The debate has focused on the Vienna forum on the UN Global Initiative. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and others mentioned the briefing that we received from Stop the Traffik. The Minister in another place, Mr Vernon Coaker, referred to it in complimentary terms, but did not say what he thought of its proposals in detail. We look forward to learning what the Government think of them today.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC207"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000205"></a>The interdepartmental ministerial group on human trafficking has been referred to several times. I understand that it has not met for several months and therefore is not contributing anything. Stop the Traffik proposes that it be replaced by a national rapporteur on human trafficking, who it suggests would have more time, resources, profile and power to assist in the implementation of the UK&#146;s action plan. I like the idea of an official with this title co-ordinating and prompting government departments and others whose authority is needed and reporting on progress. The rapporteur should not have executive power, as Stop the Traffik suggests, but would have great persuasive influence across the board, as does the Children&#146;s Commissioner, for instance, in a related field. There are other constitutional precedents for the appointment of tsars with cross-departmental responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000206"></a>Mr Dismore mentioned in another place a letter that he had received from the Minister announcing the review of our reservation on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has also been referred to today. We particularly welcome this concession, recalling that we argued during the passage the UK Borders Bill that the convention should apply to the BIA except where removal is being implemented. It might well be argued that sending a child back to, say, Iraq or the DRC was not in that child&#146;s best interests, but the main problem we have always had is the treatment of children in detention, where the Government say they already comply with the CRC. If that is true, I cannot imagine what possible objection there could be to applying the convention to all the activities of the BIA except those immediately concerned with removal.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000207"></a>In the debate in another place, my right honourable friend the Member for Eastleigh particularly highlighted the problem of trafficked children being used as domestic slaves, and the disappearance of children from local authority care has been mentioned today. That is one of the areas in which it is important to identify migrants as victims of crime and as potential witnesses. We ask how the inherent difference of approach between the police, who are anxious to obtain evidence against traffickers, and the BIA, whose remit is to enforce immigration control, can be best resolved.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000288"></a>5.41 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000208"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08012485000318"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, is a doughty fighter for those who are trafficked, and I am glad that she has been able to generate this debate again today. It gives us an opportunity to acknowledge her experience, authority and conviction on this matter. I also wish to thank Stop the Traffik because it has generated two debates&#151;one in the House of Commons and one today in the House of Lords&#151;which are designed to draw attention to the Vienna conference.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000209"></a>First, much has been said about the Vienna conference&#151;the questions that I would have asked have probably been put&#151;but it is important that the Minister should let us know who is attending on behalf of the Government so that we can see the level  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at which interest is being taken. How will the Government let us know what comes out of the conference? What does the Minister hope the conference will achieve?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000210"></a>Secondly, the debate today has reminded us that this country is a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, but we still have not ratified it. I know that the Home Office decided earlier this month to &#147;accelerate&#148; doing so, but it is hardly the foot down in the fast lane to say that it will not be done until the end of the year. Every other European country appears to have managed to get on with it, apparently without trouble, and we are still pussyfooting around waiting for &#147;necessary legislative and procedural changes&#148; to bring it about. Can the Minister confirm what has already been asked about the legislative programme? Can he confirm that legislation will be passed in this Session?</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000211"></a>Thirdly&#151;and this is by far the most important aspect&#151;the debate has underlined once again the sickening nature of this terrible affront to humanity. It would be easier perhaps, but still not let us off the hook, if we were able to say with hand on heart, &#147;This awful thing did not happen here&#148;. But as other noble Lords have pointed out today, we cannot do that. We are a receiving country of countless men, women and children who are abducted from their homes or persuaded to leave on the grounds that there are good jobs on offer. They arrive illegally through our porous borders and then find themselves bound to the traffickers, often being forced into debt bondage or into the sex trade, kept in appalling conditions and, because of their illegal status, unable or too frightened to turn to anyone in authority.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000212"></a>As others have said, we are not alone; this is a world-wide problem. It is a tragedy for the millions of people caught up in the trade which, as the <I>Guardian</I> recently reported, is estimated to be worth&#151;figures have been bandied around today and this is another one&#151;in the region of $44 billion globally. The United Nations estimates that up to 27 million people are currently held in slavery, the majority of whom are Asian women. It is an appalling situation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000213"></a>Let me concentrate for a minute on the situation in this country. It is not as if nothing is being done to address the problem&#151;it is&#151;but can the Minister tell us whether the Government would consider introducing separate interviews for women and children travelling into this country? They have not done so, but this would identify the children who are being brought in illegally and against their will. Furthermore, why did the conviction rate for trafficking offences under the Sexual Offences Act actually fall by 40 per cent between 2006 and 2007? However, we know about the police operations taking place in the form of Pentameter 1 and 2, and it is good news that the London police have today made further moves in this respect.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000214"></a>In closing, I want briefly to touch on the POPPY project, which is a fantastic but underused resource. It is almost incomprehensible that the most vulnerable victims of trafficking, children, are excluded from access to it. I would like to ask the Minister whether  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he will look again at the Home Office&#146;s own criteria which stipulate that people under the age of 18 should not have access to this project. Social services can deal with many of the problems associated with children, but they often need expert help. It is ridiculous to deny people under the age of 18 access to this resource, one that is funded by the Government. We might as well make proper use of it.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000215"></a>There is an enormous amount to be done. We have had great contributions from all those who have participated in the debate. For my part, I hope that the convention in Vienna is not only a success, but provides some really purposeful proposals for the future.</p>
<h5><a name="08012485000289"></a>5.46 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012485000216"></a><b><a name="80124-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012485000319"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> I begin by joining in the thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for raising this issue, and indeed I have great admiration for all her work in this area. I thank also other noble Lords for their contributions, which have reflected clearly the abhorrence all of us have for this foul practice. I share that deep abhorrence. It is a modern form of slavery, as has been said. As a Government I think that we have a good story to tell, and that is not least because of the engagement and involvement of a number of noble Lords which have helped to make things move forward. However, there is a long way to go in some areas, and having noted the number of questions put to me in the debate&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, had 18, and the average of each noble Lord who spoke was eight or nine&#151;there is merit in making more regular progress reports in some form. I am not sure how we can do that, but I will talk to officials and see if there is a way. I do not know how easily it can be done, and I should take care because I am always getting into trouble for saying that I will do things without knowing quite how to achieve them.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000217"></a>I should say, as an admiral, that the Royal Navy was a huge force for good in suppressing the slave trade. We lost something like 17,000 men, mainly from sickness, in that task. The period of 35 to 40 years in which the navy was engaged in that effort is something we should be proud of. It is not directly applicable to this debate, but I have to get a plug in for the navy in some way.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000218"></a>There is no doubt that human trafficking is a very evil practice. It is perpetrated for profit by organised criminals across the world who have absolutely no regard for victims or society as a whole. It is a multi-faceted phenomenon, one that knows no borders and occurs both within nations and across international boundaries. As many speakers have emphasised today, trafficking needs to be fought on many fronts, and the key to a successful response is effective collaboration and partnership working. I believe that the Government have embraced this approach, and an important part of that is an active involvement with our international partners.</p>

<p><a name="08012485000219"></a>That brings me to the UN Vienna forum, which was set up by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to co-ordinate the global fight against  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC210"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>human trafficking and build on the platform provided by the Palermo protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, although it focused particularly on women and children. This is the arena in which we can address many of the proposals that have been raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Cox, Lady Nicholson, Lady Thomas, and others. The United Kingdom has supported the UN initiative from the outset, the formal launch having taken place in London on 26 March last year and at which my honourable friend Vernon Coaker spoke on behalf of the Government. Vital Voices, through my noble friend Lady Goudie, arranged the event, and we are indebted to my noble friend for all her hard work in this sphere.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000220"></a>The Vienna forum will bring together representatives from member states, the United Nations and other international organisations, the business community, academia and non-governmental organisations with the objective of raising awareness and facilitating the co-operation between stakeholders that a number of us have talked about and realise is so important. The United Kingdom will be an active participant at the event. My honourable friend Vernon Coaker intends to attend the opening meeting to make a statement about the United Kingdom&#146;s approach to tackling human trafficking.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000221"></a>The United Kingdom delegation will include representatives from the UK Human Trafficking Centre, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Border and Immigration Agency as well as officials from the Foreign Office and the Home Office. The UK Human Trafficking Centre has been asked specifically to chair the &#147;From Protection to Persecution&#148; session at the forum and give a presentation on UK Operations Pentameter and Pentameter 2, which speakers have already mentioned. The UK representatives will also speak on the international projects in which we are currently engaged in the special event called &#147;International Co-operation: Identifying and Overcoming the Problem&#148;.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000222"></a>The UK Government have a comprehensive end-to-end strategy in place to tackle human trafficking, and have made considerable progress in that area with the publication of the UK action plan in March 2007 and, on the same day, our signing of the Council of Europe Convention. The action plan pulls together existing work and sets out future action. It applies to all forms of human trafficking and sets out proposals in the key areas of prevention: enforcement and prosecution, protection and assistance to adult victims and child trafficking. Other recent progress includes the introduction of comprehensive anti-trafficking laws, resulting in a number of successful convictions.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000223"></a>We established the Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2006, which has tackling human trafficking as one of its top priorities and is now also supported by a new police-led multi-agency UK Human Trafficking Centre, which became operational in October 2006.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000224"></a>We are also continuing to work with the POPPY project, which has been mentioned, to provide secure support and accommodation to adult female victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. In 2006 the first  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC211"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of our major national anti-trafficking operations took place. Operation Pentameter 1 was a great success. We established the UK Human Trafficking Centre after that to support, develop and co-ordinate our response. We recovered 88 victims, of whom 12 were children. That shows the sort of success that is possible. Operation Pentameter 2 was launched in October 2007 and is currently ongoing. It is another catalyst designed to encourage proactive policing, which some noble Lords touched on. That needs to be done. It is an illustrative process of teaching people how they need to approach this issue, and showing that it is core police business.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000225"></a>Human trafficking does not always involve immigration issues. However, it always involves serious criminality including rape, false imprisonment and often violence. It is a very serious crime. We have had 70 convictions to date&#151;and I would like there to be more&#151;for trafficking for sex and exploitation under the Sexual Offenders Act 2003, resulting in sentences between two and nine years on specific counts, while convictions for several counts have resulted in sentences of up to 21 years&#151;and quite right and proper too.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000226"></a>Intelligence from Pentameter 2 is already further developing our understanding of the nature and scale of trafficking across the UK. Part of the problem is that we do not really understand that, and we really must. Following the conclusion of the operation, the UK Human Trafficking Centre in conjunction with the Serious Organised Crime Agency will produce an updated strategic assessment of human trafficking in the UK, which will help us improve upon estimates in previous research and will further enable us to respond to the reality rather than the perception&#151;and I fear that the reality is probably worse.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000227"></a>A significant number of victims have been identified already&#151;I cannot talk about that in detail; the situation is ongoing&#151;and are receiving support as appropriate. It is not possible yet to give exact numbers because we are still in the middle of this operation. However, more than 542 premises have been visited. A large percentage of them has been residential, which shows just how hidden the crime is&#151;it could be taking place in the house next door&#151;which is a very worrying aspect of it. In excess of &#163;400,000 has already been seized in cash, with a number of money-laundering investigations taking place and a number of restraint orders instituted. I believe that we will find much more money, because a lot of it is involved.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000228"></a>The G6 initiative is linked to Pentameter 2 and is another example of this Government&#146;s commitment to working in collaboration with international partners. The initiative is led by the United Kingdom and Poland, and is running from July 2007 until July of this year. The UK proposed that G6 countries should undertake a period of joint operational activity along the lines of Operation Pentameter. A number of noble Lords asked whether there is some way of doing this. We are looking specifically at that to see what we can do.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000229"></a>A number of activities and meetings have now taken place, with the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland committed to this project, supported by Europol, Interpol and Eurojust. The project involves a number of strands of activity. It looks at how traffickers can be tackled more effectively and how best practice can be shared among the participating states. It looks also at whether there is any benefit in undertaking joint awareness projects, which there probably is.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000230"></a>Further European engagement took place at the international seminar on the Council of Europe convention against trafficking in December. The seminar was jointly hosted by the Home Office and the Council of Europe. It discussed the development of policy and sought to identify the most effective responses to all elements of anti-trafficking work. There were around 80 participants, with more than 10 member states invited as well as a large number of United Kingdom stakeholders. We greatly value the participation and input of such stakeholders as part of our collaborative approach&#151;a number of noble Lords mentioned the importance of collaboration, which I re-emphasise&#151;and we have sought to involve them also through our ministerial non-government organisation group.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000231"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that the Home Secretary announced on Monday the Government&#146;s intention to accelerate plans to ratify the Council of Europe convention. We have worked hard and consulted widely since signing it. For example, we have piloted a model of victim identification within the Pentameter 2 operation, identified gaps in compliance, and developed models of victim support. There is much still to do, but our progress means that we now believe that we can make the necessary legislative and procedural changes to achieve ratification later this year. However, we can succeed only with the full support of both Houses, because legislation is involved, and colleagues in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000232"></a>The Home Secretary also announced on Monday the Government&#146;s intention to review the UK&#146;s immigration reservation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

However, it should be noted that our reservation has no effect on how victims of trafficking are treated while they are in this country: their protection and safety already become the responsibility of local authorities within our child protection legislation.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000235"></a>We have worked with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to develop an advice and information line for social carers and other professionals to help them identify and support trafficked children. The advice line went live in October last year, and multi-agency guidance was published in December to provide comprehensive information to all front-line professionals on the identification of victims and the actions required.</p>

I hope that the Minister will have time to mention that important matter before he sits down.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000238"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, spoke of urging companies to ensure that they comply with the benefits of not proceeding with slavery. We strongly support that responsible business behaviour. International business has an important contribution to make, but we promote adherence to OECD guidelines on multinational enterprise. NGOs and trades unions can, and have, raised complaints against companies. Under OECD mechanisms, we are investigating complaints and producing conclusions as necessary to try to make a move forward in that area.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000239"></a>Will DfID commit to the mainstreaming of anti-trafficking strategies? They are committed to addressing the underlying problems that make poor people vulnerable to trafficking, and that includes helping to build states that work for poor people. We are addressing those issues by supporting nationally developed poverty-reduction programmes.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000240"></a>There was mention of the possibility of a Royal Commission. This is the bicentenary of the abolition  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the slave trade. There is already extensive parliamentary and public scrutiny of action in this area, and there are regular debates. The Joint Committee on Human Rights undertook an inquiry into the Government&#146;s efforts, and therefore we do not believe that a Royal Commission is necessary.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000241"></a>On the EU anti-trafficking hotline, we fully recognise the need for transnational work. However, we foresee some real difficulties with the hotline, including issues relating to management and dissemination of information.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000242"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, referred to Romanian child trafficking. The Metropolitan Police work very closely with the Romanians and we have two Romanian police officers working with the Metropolitan Police at the moment.</p>

<a name="80124-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012485000243"></a>I have a number of questions still to answer, including one about the rapporteur to which there is a rather long, one-page answer. Perhaps I may write to noble Lords on the issues raised. I hope I have given some oversight. There is still much to do but I would not want the Committee to be in any doubt about our resolve to curb this absolutely loathsome traffic. I believe that those involved will be identified; we will track them down and they will suffer the full penalty of the law. That people should treat their fellow human beings in this way in the 21st century is very depressing. We intend that the culprits should have nowhere to hide. We are intent on getting them and rescuing and looking after those involved. I apologise for being over long.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08012458000009"></a>I have today announced the publication of a consultation document looking at a number of ways of making the blue badge scheme more secure and ensure it continues to benefit those who need it. We are consulting on the eligibility criteria for the scheme together with better ways of administering and enforcing the scheme in order to cut down on levels of abuse.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08012458000010"></a>I have also announced today the publication of revised local authority guidance for England and the launch of a new &#163;500,000 Blue Badge Centres of Excellence Fund, to promote best practice and improve consistency on the administration and enforcement of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08012458000012"></a>The disabled person's parking badge scheme (&#147;the blue badge scheme&#148;) was introduced in 1971 to provide parking close to essential amenities and services for people with severe mobility problems.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08012458000013"></a>The scheme is designed to help severely disabled people to travel independently, as either a driver or a passenger, by allowing them to park close to their destination.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08012458000014"></a><I>Consultation document</I></p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08012458000015"></a>In May 2007 an independent consultant, Rob Smith, was commissioned to conduct a review of the blue badge scheme.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08012458000016"></a>The final report has been published today and is available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/bluebadge">www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/bluebadge</a> and addresses the following issues:</p>
eligibility (who should qualify for the scheme?);concessions (which concessions should apply?);better administration (how can the scheme be more consistently administered and enforced?) and;choice and alternatives within the scheme.
<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08012458000017"></a>We are now consulting on a number of issues that arose from the report. The department's draft response to the review, which is included as part of the consultation document published today, reflects our preliminary thinking and is designed to help us to modernise the scheme within the context of current transport policy, making it more consistently administered, tougher on fraud and easier to understand. The department will be working closely with stakeholders, including disabled groups, throughout the consultation period.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08012458000018"></a>The consultation document includes proposals to:</p>
extend the reach of the scheme, for example, ensuring more parents of severely disabled children are eligible for a badge;

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08012458000019"></a>The consultation also asks if individual local authorities should be given the opportunity to run aspects of the scheme in a way that responds to local circumstances.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08012458000020"></a>The final date for responses to be received by the DfT is 17 April 2008. The full consultation document is available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations">www.dft.gov.uk/consultations</a>.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08012458000028"></a>The Government have today laid before Parliament the<I> Review of Voting Systems: the experience of new voting systems in the United Kingdom since 1997</I> (Cm 7304).</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08012458000029"></a>This report delivers the Labour 2005 manifesto commitment to review the experience of the newly introduced voting systems for the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies, the European Parliament, and the London Mayor and Assembly, to inform the ongoing debate about the voting system in the House of Commons.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS13"></a><b>24 Jan 2008 : Column WS13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08012458000030"></a>Since 1997 the Government have embarked upon a major programme of constitutional change: devolving power away from Westminster, enshrining fundamental rights in the Human Rights Act, introducing freedom of information and completing the first stages of reform to the House of Lords.  New voting systems were introduced when the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1998. In addition, a new voting system was introduced for elections to the European Parliament in 1999, and for elections to the Greater London Assembly and the London Mayoralty established that year.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08012458000031"></a>Our constitutional arrangements have never been fixed, nor should they be.  A strength of the British constitution is that it evolves to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of our democracy. </p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08012458000032"></a>To that end the Government established the Jenkins commission to report on a suitable voting system for the House of Commons. In 1998 Jenkins proposed a completely new voting system for Westminster called the alternative vote plus. At the time my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, stated (as Home Secretary) &#147;we need to see how the new elections systems settle down in Scotland, Wales, London and the European Parliament... a great deal of constitutional change is under way, and the British people would not thank us for moving too quickly without thinking carefully about how changes fit into the whole&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/11/98; col. 1038.] This view was widely supported across the House of Commons. </p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08012458000033"></a>The Government therefore decided to review and assess how the new voting systems would perform, and then consider the implications for Westminster. </p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08012458000034"></a>The new voting systems introduced since 1997 have now been in place for some time and provide experience of up to three elections in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and two elections for the European Parliament, London Mayor and London Assembly.  We therefore have a wealth of practical experience from within the United Kingdom upon which to draw.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08012458000035"></a>This review provides a summary of the experiences of the new voting systems introduced over the past decade and on that basis sets out the advantages and disadvantages associated with each.  It uses a range of commonly accepted criteria for assessing the experience of the new voting systems.  These include the degree of proportionality under different systems, the impact on voters in terms of the choices available, voter turnout rates, the impact on political campaigning, social representation, government formation and administration of elections under different systems.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08012458000036"></a>The experiences of some other countries, including New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, which have similar systems to those introduced within the United Kingdom, is also examined.  In addition, the review refers to the findings of other studies into voting systems within the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08012458000037"></a>The review is intended to inform the ongoing debate about the voting system in Westminster but does not make any recommendations. </p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08012458000038"></a>It remains the Government&#146;s strong view that since the voting system for Westminster Commons elections could fundamentally change the way parliamentary democracy operates, any proposed changes would need to be endorsed by a referendum.</p>

<a name="80124-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08012458000039"></a>At this point, it would be premature to seek to reform the electoral system for the Commons while the voting system for a reformed and substantially or fully elected House of Lords is still to be determined.  Reform of the electoral system for the Lords to a wholly or 80 per cent elected chamber was supported by the House of Commons free vote in March 2007 and the Government are committed to formulating a comprehensive package of Lords reform, including developing detailed proposals for a wholly or mainly elected second Chamber. Good progress is being made on the cross-party talks on Lords reform and the Government intend to publish a White Paper in the first part of 2008 reflecting the outcome of these discussions. </p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08012474000041"></a>On 21 December, my officials announced that the UK is now in a period of low-vector activity as winter temperatures mean that midges are either dying off, inactive and/or unable to transmit virus. This means that, upon receipt of negative test results, farmers can move their animals out of the surveillance and protection zones to the bluetongue free area. It is hoped that the relaxation of movement restrictions during the vector-free period will alleviate some of the problems the industry has been facing during the bluetongue outbreak.</p>

The reporting requirements have varied over the period for which information is requested due to the introduction of Local Area Agreements (LAAs) in Lancashire with effect from 1 April 2006 when NRF was pooled in the two unitaries. The detailed performance management of projects funded by NRF has been the responsibility of local authorities, as accountable bodies, in consultation with their Local Strategic Partnerships.</p>

The tables below reflect the information which local authorities were required to submit in their quarterly returns and statements of grant usage. In the current year, 2007-08, NRF is paid as part of the LAA grant and is unringfenced, meaning there are no separate reporting requirements.</p>

In certain circumstances, the Environment Agency can carry out remediation work itself.</p>
