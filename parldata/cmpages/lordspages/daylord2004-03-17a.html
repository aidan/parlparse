<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action is being taken to combat anti-Semitism in the United Kingdom.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, the Government have in recent years strengthened both the legal framework against race discrimination and the criminal penalties for offences such as incitement to racial hatred and for racially or religiously aggravated assault and criminal damage. Police forces continue to be alert to crimes being committed against members of the Jewish community and take appropriate steps to safeguard people and property. Furthermore, we support and are encouraging the growing amount of dialogue that is taking place between communities, including faith communities, in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that positive Answer. Does she agree that we are witnessing the return of the oldest hatred? Figures recently released by the Community Security Trust speak for themselves. In 2003, there was a 15 per cent rise in anti-Semitic assaults; 104 synagogues have been vandalised in just over three years; and the damage and desecration of Jewish property in 2003 alone rose by 31 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40317-01_para1"></a>Does my noble friend agree that this country has a long history of combating anti-Semitism, but that this recent resurgence has been coupled with claims that the Jewish community is suffering as a result of its support for and affiliation with the state of Israel? Does my noble friend further agree that the conviction of racially and religiously aggravated offences we have witnessed should not be conditional upon people of the Jewish religion having to denounce the state of Israel? What is being done about that?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I totally agree with my noble friend. Expressions of hatred of Jewish people, let alone attacks on persons and property, are simply unacceptable. Criticisms of the policies of a foreign government cannot be used to justify such behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister consider that the provisions relating to the incitement of racial and religious hatred are adequate? How many cases have been brought before the court involving those who have perpetrated racially and religiously aggravated crimes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we now have appropriate legislation to deal with these issues. There have been increasing figures. The CPS figures for racist incidents show that in relation to the period 2001&#150;02, there were 5,764 charges and 3,597 of those were prosecuted. Those are the most recent figures we have.
<P>

<a name="40317-01_para2"></a>The figure for the total number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United Kingdom for 2003 is 375; that is 25 more than last year. It is a worrying figure, but we have some good examples of prosecutions which are robust and successful. The most important was that for which a period of nine years' imprisonment followed. We are therefore giving the clearest signal possible that this behaviour is wholly and totally unacceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is important to understand the reasoning behind the numbers? Is she aware that the Institute for Jewish Policy Research&#151;I declare an interest as its president&#151;has been allowed by the Metropolitan Police to have access to their records so that a proper study can be made of the nature of these incidents, their location, social context and motivation? Is it not important to understand those aspects so that we can then understand more fully the exact nature of anti-Semitism and racial hatred in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend says, it is very important for us to understand the basis of such prejudice and dreadful behaviour, because it is only by understanding it that we might be able to craft something that will work to stop it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness is well aware, there is much discussion about the possible interconnection between the policies of the state of Israel and the rise of anti-Semitism. Will she encourage other organisations to follow the good example of the Government and remind people that, however critical they might be of this Israeli Government&#151;and some of the most critical voices come from Israel itself&#151;that state has legitimate security needs which need to be publicly recognised?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we have made that plain and it would be right to underscore it. All the efforts that are being undertaken by ordinary men and women who come together to try to change the culture are equally important. I commend to the House the efforts being made by the Women's Interface Network. It was started by Lady Levy and brings women together from across the board to discuss, share and develop a better understanding that we should all try to generate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, as the Government acknowledge that incitement to religious hatred is a growing evil and that actual offences motivated by religious hatred are increasing, why have not the Government found time to debate the report of the Select Committee on Religious Offences?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, all debates have to go through the usual channels to find space. I know that the noble Lord may wish that the Government had a greater say over the usual channels. We may wish for that as well, but we simply do not have it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, despite the comments of my noble friend, does she agree that anti-Semitism and other racial crimes have increased, but should not have done so? The whole House will understand her unconditional repudiation of all racial crime. In my view, that is what we should stand for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. There has been a rise in racially motivated crimes&#151;both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. I condemn both.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the French Minister for education has just launched a pamphlet that gives guidance for French schools to deal with and counter the worrying rise in anti-Semitic incidents there? If the Government are not already doing so, would they consider giving such guidance to schools in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware that the French Minister of education was doing that. I can reassure my noble friend that the Department for Education and Skills is fully supportive of all that we do and tries to ensure that children and people in education are aware of our firm views on appropriate behaviour and comments; and that they form an important part of citizenship and other educational programmes in our schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to continue to pay the salaries of Members of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly and those of their support staff after 9th April 2004 if by that date the Assembly has not been convened.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spmin1"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  My Lords, the question of the salaries and allowances paid to Members of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly and to parties is being kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that brief Answer. Is she aware that in the 19 months from the suspension in October 2002, until Good Friday this year, the Assembly will have cost the taxpayer just under &#163;10 million? Your Lordships' Chamber is reckoned to be the cheapest legislature in the western world and Stormont is the most expensive, because it has not done a stroke of work since 2002. When will the Government call a halt to that pointless expenditure? Stopping the pay of MLAs might just spur them at last to enter into meaningful negotiations. Would not Good Friday be an appropriate day to start?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, is aware of the justification that we have given for the payment of MLA salaries and allowances, as well as party allowances, following the election. MLAs carry out constituency duties and have done so since the elections in November 2003. I do not consider it right to keep people engaged in politics without an income and, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, is aware, some are participating in the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, does the Lord President agree that this situation has occurred because of Sinn Fein's continual refusal to give up terrorism? Furthermore, does she agree that the privileges granted to Sinn Fein by special resolution of another place should also be withdrawn? She may be aware that only today, or perhaps yesterday, Sinn Fein spent &#163;25,000 in America taking a full-page advertisement decrying the PSNI.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, knows that I have said many times from this Dispatch Box that we want to see an end to all paramilitary activity. As part of the review process, since the Tohill incident, focus has been placed on the need to end paramilitary activity and the Government are working towards that. We want to see the peace process in Northern Ireland enshrined and the people of Northern Ireland want to see that as well. The Taoiseach and my right honourable friend the Prime <P>


<a name="column_263"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 263</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister will try to reinvigorate the process in their meetings next week and we should give them every support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, would the Leader of the House be good enough to have another shot at answering the Question that was put to her? Do the Government intend to continue to pay the salaries of Members from 9 April, which is in about four weeks' time? As I understood it, the noble Baroness said that the matter was continuously under review, but will salaries continue to be paid or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the fact that I said that the process is under review means that a decision on stopping payments has not been made. The payments will continue and the process will be reviewed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness have a view on the question asked by my noble friend Lord Glentoran concerning the advertisement placed in the American press?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter for Sinn Fein.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness indicate whether she considers satisfactory the non-activity of the Assembly and the fact that this House and the other place spent three-and-a-half hours in total scrutinising the budget for the entirety of Northern Ireland? If direct rule continues for much longer, will there be some other way in which such scrutiny can be properly achieved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords will know that I am as concerned as they are that we are having to deal with some complicated and quite technical information in a Grand Committee. We would all like to see devolution restored as quickly as possible and we have made that absolutely clear. That is what we are working towards.
<P>

<a name="40317-02_para0"></a>One issue that we discussed in this House recently was the importance of support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the fact that, for example, we want to see Sinn Fein included on the Policing Board in Northern Ireland. Reference has been made to the advertisement in the United States. I deeply regret that but it is a matter for Sinn Fein. However, we all feel that Sinn Fein's role&#151;for example, on the Policing Board&#151;would take the peace process much further forward. We would like to see devolution restored and that is what we are working for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, does the Lord President agree that, in the context of the Question, the newspaper advertisement to which reference has been made is not entirely a matter for Sinn Fein? Basically, the Question concerns how long the Assembly will remain suspended, and Sinn Fein's acceptance of the policing of Northern Ireland has a direct bearing on that. Therefore, the two issues are interlinked. We <P>


<a name="column_264"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not say that this matter is entirely for Sinn Fein; it is for this Government, the Irish Government and, at this moment, this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the use of its money for the placing of advertisements in the United States is a matter for Sinn Fein. The policy implications of that and the fact that we, the Irish Government and others have worked tirelessly to bring all parties to the table is of course a matter for this House and for all of us. But there is a distinction between those two issues. I was asked specifically about the amount of money spent on an advertisement. That is not a matter for the British Government, but the policy implications arising from that and from the work that we are doing to restore devolution and to bring peace to Northern Ireland are, of course, matters of great concern to this Government, this House and the Irish Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, have the Government taken, or do they intend to take, any steps to point out publicly in America that, when the PSNI was set up, Gerry Adams said that Sinn Fein would treat anyone who joined it, including the young Catholics whom everyone hoped would join, as it had always treated the police&#151;that is, they would be killed? The first young graduate was, indeed, shot at. What steps are the Government taking to set these matters right publicly in the United States, as opposed to talking behind the scenes, very properly, with government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness may be aware that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is in the United States at this very moment. He will be engaging in talks on these matters not only with US Government representatives but with others. In relation to employment within the Police Service of Northern Ireland, we have worked very hard with regard to 50:50 recruitment and we have seen the number of Catholics recruited increase from 8 to 14 per cent. There was some controversy in this House surrounding the renewal of that order. However, we remain committed to trying to bring about a more integrated service in Northern Ireland because we need a police force that reflects the community that it serves.

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="40317-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, we are working with the Equal Opportunities Commission, Opportunity Now, trade unions and employers to meet our target of 35 per cent of large organisations completing pay reviews by 2006. We have provided funding for the EOC to develop equal pay toolkits for both large and small employers and funding for trade unions to train representatives in equal pay issues. We are also supporting the EOC's sectoral approach to promoting pay reviews.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that response, but is the Minister aware that in financial services, for example, the pay gender gap is as large as 43 per cent? I am very grateful to the Government for the encouragement that they have given and for the work that is done with the EOC. But can we perhaps move a little more towards compulsion as encouragement does not seem to be working as well as it might?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge the sterling work which my noble friend carries out on these issues. Typically, she has identified one sectoral area of greatest concern&#151;that of financial services, where the gap between men's pay and women's pay is by far the largest of any sector. That is why, as a government, we are addressing that matter and indicating that other sectors are doing far better and that financial services need to improve in this respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, in responding to the Question, the Minister mentioned the Equal Pay Task Force and the work that it is doing. But will he acknowledge that the EOC's recent report stated that 54 per cent of large and 67 per cent of medium-sized employers said that they had no intention whatever of conducting such equal pay reviews? Equal pay for work of equal value has been part of our law for at least 30 years and perhaps longer. Is it not time that the Government now began to use compulsion rather than just encouragement to ensure equal pay for work of equal value?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the Government are setting the best example. It will be recognised that in the Civil Service we have made very substantial progress indeed with regard to equal pay, although we have not achieved the full objectives that we have addressed. The noble Baroness is right. She will recognise that by next year a substantial section of major employers will have completed the pay reviews. They are the lead organisations on these issues and we expect them to make real progress. Having done that, it will then be necessary to address ourselves more to the problems of others and particularly to smaller businesses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, in the Minister's first reply he mentioned that the Government are producing toolkits for equal pay. Are those toolkits readily available? Will they be extended to the private <P>


<a name="column_266"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sector, so that, in turn, that sector can put a spanner in the works to stop the leapfrogging of pay, which is started by high pay rises in the public sector?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the toolkits are widely available. I hope that the response of industry will not be to put a spanner in the works. I believe that industry will look at certain aspects of the equal pay issue. Perhaps I can give one example of the use of the toolkit. Merely shortening the band on which promotion is effected can often advantage women, as very long bands require them to serve for many years before they reach the same top point to which men graduate more readily because they have been in employment longer. Such an aspect of the toolkits, which perhaps is not widely known, will be of advantage to private industry. I believe that industry will consider that to be a progressive position that it can take up without undue cost.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </B>   My Lords, do the Government support the directive that is being prepared by Commissioner Diamantopoulos on gender equality, which, if commentators are accurate, will ensure that women pay higher insurance rates than at present in the name of equality and receive lower annuity rates, again in the name of equality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, we believe that the commissioner may marginally have misdirected himself as regards the insurance industry. We seek to emphasise the obvious fact that insurance is about risk and risk with regard to life expectancy differs according to gender.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will know that in 2001 the Bett report identified in the academic sector a systematic discrepancy of 20 per cent between male and female pay. Are there any indications that the move towards locally negotiated pay will widen or narrow those discrepancies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, it came as a surprise to the wider public that progress in academic circles was not as rapid as had been expected and that the same level of discrimination against women academics was occurring as in other areas of pay. On local versus national, provided that local negotiators follow the concepts that we seek to advance, and which are represented by the way in which we develop Civil Service pay, there is no reason, whether the negotiations are local or national, why women should not make the proper advance.

<P>
<UL>
<a name="40317-03_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what action they are taking to improve the healthcare provision for women living in rural areas in Afghanistan.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="40317-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we provided 19 per cent of the EC's &#163;282 million Afghanistan package for 2003&#150;04 (&#163;17.5 million is for health) and &#163;34 million through the World Bank. The EU and World Bank fund basic healthcare through non-government organisations. The UK also funds UNICEF which supports emergency obstetric care services, including in rural areas, and is refurbishing many maternity hospitals in major cities. Our bilateral programme to Afghanistan focuses on government capacity building and income generation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Leader of the House for her Answer. Is she aware that Afghanistan has one of the world's highest rates of maternal mortality, with over 50 per cent of deaths among expectant mothers and one rural woman dying every 20 minutes? What assessment has DfID carried out regarding female access to basic healthcare facilities in rural Afghanistan&#151;not in the cities of which she spoke? With the welcome increase in the aid budget announced today, what support is DfID planning to provide for the education and training of rural midwives, thus reaching women living in the countryside who are banned from leaving their homes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right with respect to the high levels of maternity and infant mortality in Afghanistan. DfID has not carried out any assessment. The most recent assessment is part of the WHO Afghanistan appeal, a copy of which I shall be happy to send to the noble Baroness. We have contributed to the Afghanistan ministry of health, which has prepared an interim health strategy.
<P>

<a name="40317-03_para2"></a>On the issue of funding, our funding is targeted on capacity building and working at a strategic level with the Afghan interim administration. On health, the World Bank, USAID and the European Union are the main funders. They provide those funds through a mechanism pioneered in Cambodia, where the Government are contracting NGOs to provide services across Afghanistan, particularly in rural areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister provide me with a more precise Answer to a question that I asked last Wednesday about whether NATO has agreed a timetable for the expansion of the number of troops to be deployed in Afghanistan, given that last Thursday there was a NATO meeting, and given that everyone agrees that, unless there is improved security, we shall not improve the welfare of Afghan citizens? Can she also tell the House what proportion of the money that the Chancellor announced today for Afghanistan, Iraq, and the fight against terrorism will go to Afghanistan?

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planned expansion of the provincial reconstruction team in Afghanistan and, as part of that, we are also looking at whether US troops can be focused in the south-east of the country where there is a particular concern about the re-emergence of the Taliban. What that will mean in terms of the deployment of troop numbers is still being worked out. I shall also write to the noble Baroness on the spread of money between the three areas that she mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that she heard the same words as I did from the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, which was a welcome for the announcement of increased aid? Is she as confused as I am about exactly where the Conservative Party's public expenditure plans now stand?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, welcomed the increased aid to Afghanistan. We all welcome that. On the public expenditure plans of the party opposite, there is absolutely no doubt that they are in some confusion. Perhaps noble Lords opposite will enlighten us at some future date.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, following the question from the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, does the Leader of the House see the urgency for an extension of the military intervention in Afghanistan linked to the need to get the elections going? At present, I understand that very small numbers of electors have registered. Humanitarian activity and electoral activity are severely inhibited by the breakdown of the security arrangements in the south-east.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, in relation to the issue of military intervention and increasing numbers, there are two different strategies. The provincial reconstruction teams are a mix of the military and development specialists who are working not only in terms of the security environment but to bring development in key areas of Afghanistan. Of course, there remains a concern with respect to security, particularly in the south-east where there is a re-emergence of the Taliban, and a different strategy has to be deployed in those areas. On the specific issue of the elections, some 1.466 million were registered by 15 March. We are receiving daily updates on that, and they hope to complete the registration of some 10 million before the elections. There are eight regional centres, and there will be a focus on rural areas from May.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister is going to answer on behalf of the Conservative Party, could she could get properly briefed from this side of the House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I certainly did not answer on behalf of the Conservative Party. I said that I thought that there was some confusion, and we look forward to some clarity in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, returning to the question of health services, would the noble Baroness <P>


<a name="column_269"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agree that there is a disproportionate responsibility on non-governmental organisations, and not nearly enough effort is going into reinforcing government services, especially health management? How can new emphasis be placed on this sector?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, if I understand the question asked by the noble Earl, one of the reasons that the focus of our assistance is on working with the Afghan government administration is precisely to strengthen government systems, including the health sector. We have worked with the Ministry of Health precisely in that kind of area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, returning to the subject of women's health, has the noble Baroness seen the report of the United Nations rapporteur on violence against women, which indicates the extreme levels of domestic violence and the lack of any redress for women who are the victims of these activities? Does she think that the Government should increase the level of support for women's organisations in Afghanistan, such as the one that has recently been reported as being very active in the Herat region, so that women can take action against the deprivations that they are suffering?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-03_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I have not seen the report by the UN rapporteur, but I am aware of the issues of violence against women in Afghanistan. They are of considerable concern, not least in the context of the registration of women for the elections. For example, only some 25 per cent of those who have registered to date are women. Many women are being prevented from registering by their husbands. This issue affects women's daily lives, and it will affect their longer-term contribution to the democratic process.

<A NAME="40317-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the resources available to the British Transport Police are a matter for the BTP committee, which oversees the force and sets its budget. For 2004&#150;05, the committee has agreed an increase of &#163;25 million, taking the budget to &#163;162 million. The rail industry is responsible for providing the necessary funding for the force. In addition to this funding, the Government have agreed to provide the BTP in 2003&#150;04 with an additional &#163;2.3 million for anti-terrorist response vehicles and equipment in London.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I am sure that he will want to join me in expressing a tribute to the officers of the British Transport Police for the courageous and effective work that they do in protecting the travelling public on the London Underground and on the national rail system. Notwithstanding the figures that he has just given in his reply on the funding settlement, is he aware that because of the need to provide for pensions and VAT, that settlement is still far short of what the force needs if it is to avoid a cut in the number of serving officers next year, rather than the increase which in order to counter terrorism most people would agree is reasonable? Does he further agree that it is wholly unreasonable for the railway companies and their passengers to pay the entire cost of the BTP anti-terrorism measures, which should more properly come out of national security budgets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the British Transport Police. We all know the strains and stresses that all our police forces are under at present. My noble friend will recognise that there has been a substantial increase in the budget for this year. The number of officers serving in the British Transport Police is the highest that it has been for the past 10 years, and 100 extra officers are being deployed on the London Underground. I hear what my noble friend says about extra resources. There are two glimmers of light on the horizon in that respect. First, VAT judgment is such as to ensure that the budget is increased by another &#163;3.7 million for this current year. Secondly, the Government will certainly take account of BTP's needs in the comprehensive spending review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the British Transport Police faces a Herculean task and we all wish it well. However, yesterday a spokesman for the British Transport Police said that its budget left the service facing a real challenge. Indeed, the British Transport Police Federation chairman, Alex Robertson, said that funding cuts would mean 50 fewer officers. Can the noble Lord give the House a categorical assurance that, when we are facing what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens called "an inevitable attack", there will be no cuts in officers during this difficult time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to repeat the statistic that I quoted in my original Answer. The budget has gone up by &#163;25 million to &#163;162 million. That is difficult to describe as a cut. The number of officers employed will increase over this coming year, and I have also given the indication that <P>


<a name="column_271"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for obvious reasons the Government are keeping this budget under very close scrutiny, given the circumstances that we are all in at present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, would the noble Lord be very kind and answer my question? Can he give an assurance that there will be no cuts in serving officers during this present time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I have just quoted the budget, and I have indicated that the number of serving officers will increase. The concentration on the London Underground and an increase there is fully justified and supported by the Mayor of London, for the obvious reason that we recognise that the London Underground presents an obvious and conspicuous possible target.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Imbert: </B>   My Lords, notwithstanding that there is an increase of &#163;25 million in the British Transport Police budget, and that the Government have made a grant to the BTP, and in the light of the press revelation in the past 24 hours that only 95 per cent of London Underground stations are covered by closed circuit television, does the Minister agree that, however much it costs, every effort should be made to provide full coverage of closed circuit television on every London Underground station and every overground station in the country, not only in the interest of the travelling public, but in the interests of the nation as a whole?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will recognise the resource implications of applying CCTV to every overland station in the country. He will appreciate, as I do, that the fact that 95 per cent of our Tube stations are covered by CCTV is an important defence. We will be looking at the question of the other 5 per cent. Closed circuit television clearly plays an important role in defence against any possible terrorist activity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister concede that the worrying word in the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, is "jurisdiction"? Is he absolutely sure that the various security and police forces now operating counter-terrorism are operating with the fullest co-operation: that there are no turf wars, no squirreling of information and that there is real joined-up government in this war against terrorism?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I should have thought that co-ordination could be improved in every organisation, but I assure the noble Lord that effective co-ordination between all authorities concerned with counter-terrorist activity has been the source of very substantial activity in recent months. I would certainly want to reassure the House on this factor. Noble Lords may well have seen advertisements going up only this week about care with regard to the Underground and packages left unattended on it. That process was not <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40317-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B>   rose to call attention to the role of marriage in securing the well-being of the nation's children and their parents in 21st-century Britain; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, last week I mentioned to an acquaintance that I was introducing a debate on marriage. He said, "Are you for or against?". My answer is that I am for healthy, happy marriages and I am against dysfunctional, unhappy ones. Healthy marriages are good for children, for parents and for society as a whole, whereas dysfunctional marriages are hell for everybody.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para2"></a>I am going to argue this afternoon that there are many things which can be done and should be done to help those who have made the choice to marry to have a more healthy and happy marriage, and to help those who are wondering whether or not to marry to make the choice wisely.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para3"></a>It is very much in the interest of us all that more marriages should be happy marriages, and that couples before they enter into marriage should understand what it is all about. Since I introduced a debate on marriage five years ago, the Government have said, in their consultation document, Strengthening Families:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This Government believes that marriage provides a strong foundation for stable relationships. This does not mean trying to make people marry, or criticising or penalising people who choose not to. We do not believe that government should interfere in people's lives in that way. But we do share the belief of the majority of people, that marriage provides the most reliable framework for raising children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-04_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40317-04_para5"></a>I agree. The decision to marry is a private one. But that does not mean that it is not one which has huge consequences for society and for the state, particularly where children are involved.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para6"></a>The state has a major stake in marriage. For example, a much higher proportion of single parent families than married families are on benefits. The cost of marriage breakdown is about &#163;5 billion a year, and that is not to mention the human cost, which cannot be quantified. The state should encourage and not compel. It should provide practical help and not moralise. But it cannot afford to ignore the problem.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para7"></a>Marriage is a delicate subject to debate. I know many noble Lords have strong feelings on the subject. None of us wants to hurt or offend those whose lives have taken a different course to our own. I will do my <P>


<a name="column_273"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>best to present a balanced picture, but I hope noble Lords will have compassion on me&#151;I have only 15 minutes.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para8"></a>Fifty years ago in this country marriage was the norm&#151;at the very heart of family life. Children born outside marriage&#151;and there were a tiny minority of them&#151;were called illegitimate and they were stigmatised and disadvantaged. Although there were reasons for this, it was cruel for the children and often cruel for their parents. Also in those days, some children suffered because their parents were locked together in a miserable, confrontational marriage. Today all that has changed. There is no longer any stigma to being born of parents who are not married. Few parents today stay together in unhappy marriages. In 2002, 40 per cent of children were born outside marriage, and in the same year more than 147,000 couples divorced.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para9"></a>Alas, today we have a different set of problems. The sad truth is that still far too many of the nation's children are growing up in family circumstances which will deny them the chance to develop to their full potential, which will deny them equal opportunity in adult life. I hesitate to quote these educational statistics, but it is said that about 17 per cent of all children today leave school functionally illiterate, and last year only 55 per cent of girls and 44 per cent of boys got more than five passes at A to C level in GCSEs and GNVQs.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para10"></a>These statistics reflect not only on the schools but also on the families in which those children grew up. I believe that the time has come to have another look at marriage. I suggest that the mission for any review of marriage should be to see if we can increase the percentage of the nation's children who grow up in a family which enables them to develop to their full potential, while at the same time providing a fulfilling life for their parents.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para11"></a>I want to look at the needs of children. The physical needs of children and their parents are basic to well-being. Poverty, unemployment, inappropriate housing, inadequate services and so forth, all affect the ability of parents to give what they need to their children. This Government have boldly started to address many of these problems and I congratulate them on doing so. It has, however, to be said&#151;which they realise&#151;that there is very much more still to be done. However, due to the limited time this afternoon, I shall focus on the emotional needs of children which are also absolutely fundamental to children's well-being.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para12"></a>Every young child needs to grow up in a cocoon of security, based on a loving, long-term relationship with one or two or more adults. In the majority of cases that will mean parents. A child needs to feel safe as it gradually explores the world into which it has been launched by birth. Children need routine. They fear change because the unknown is threatening to them.
<P>


<a name="column_274"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para13"></a>In the debate in 1999, the noble Lord, Lord Laming, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Disruption to family life and to the relationships which children have with the adult on whom they depend usually results in children becoming insecure and fearful of the future".&#151;[Official Report, 24/3/99; col. 1324.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-04_para14"></a>
To feel safe, a child needs guidance and boundaries, to know what is expected of him and a secure framework in which to grow up. A father's role in the home is important. Children thrive on the "father/mother" relationship. Every child will seek out male and female role models whom they can respect and learn from. Parenting is a tough job; it is easier if there are two to share the burden. All these things, and many others, point to the advantages for a child of having two parents working together in a long-term, stable, committed, harmonious relationship. It also emphasises the case for a structure within which that relationship can be sustained.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para15"></a>It is often said, particularly by the professionals and politicians, that family relationships matter more than family structures. Of course that is a perfectly true statement, but it is not the whole story. Committed relationships are very much more difficult to sustain without a structure of commitment and clear understanding by the parties who have entered into them. Today 50 per cent of all cohabiting couples with children part within 10 years, as against only 12 per cent of married couples with children.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para16"></a>In this country today&#151;it may be a pity but it is a fact&#151;the only legal structure that we have for formalising a long-term commitment is marriage. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, introduced the Civil Partnerships Bill last year which contained provisions for heterosexual partnerships. The government Benches shot those proposals down in flames, and as far as I can see the Government have now backed off from heterosexual civil partnerships, which means that for the foreseeable future healthy marriage seems to be the best chance to secure for more children the support they need for a good start in life.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para17"></a>In saying that, I acknowledge, of course, that marriage is not the only way. We all know of children who have grown up in single-parent families, cohabiting families and reconstituted families and have had a happy and successful life, but statistics show that, overall and on a range of measures, children brought up in a stable, happy, two-parent family will, on average, do better in school and in later life than those who are not. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The research is clear. It tells us that children are best nurtured and cared for by two people living together in harmony on a long term basis".&#151;[Official Report, 24/3/99; col. 1319.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-04_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40317-04_para19"></a>I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not advocating trying to persuade people to marry, if they do not want to. I am not advocating trying to persuade people to stay married, if they do not want to. I am advocating positive action to help those who are married to have a full, healthy and happy marriage and to give those who are considering marriage a sound understanding of the advantages and challenges. The United States Congress has just voted 1.5 billion dollars for a programme that will attempt to achieve exactly that objective.
<P>


<a name="column_275"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para20"></a>I must admit that the social background in the UK today is not promising for a healthy marriage. Many young people today, especially young women, are unconvinced of the need for marriage. At the other end of the scale, uneducated and disadvantaged young women have trouble finding a decent man who will make a commitment. The father's traditional role in a low-income family as protector and provider has largely been taken over by the state. In 1999, David Sheppard said that if a father was excluded from regular employment, it had "crucial effects" on family life. He was also quoted as saying that he had been told that, in some disadvantaged communities,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Men are regarded as redundant'&#151;in the home as well as at work".&#151;[Official Report, 24/3/99; col. 1298.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-04_para21"></a>
I have more on that subject, but I will not delay the House. I will move on to what I have marked as the action plan.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para22"></a>I would not wish to end without giving the House some positive thoughts about things that could and should be done in this country today. Research over the past five years by One Plus One has shown that, by the time that a healthy marriage has degenerated into a dysfunctional marriage, it is usually far too late for intervention to be effective. Much more time and resources should be devoted to enabling young people to acquire the knowledge and the emotional and interpersonal skills that they will need before marriage, in the early years of marriage and at the transition points, before trouble sets in.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para23"></a>Action should be concentrated in five areas. First, I should mention the physical and environmental problems to which I referred briefly. I shall say no more about those; we all know about them. The second point is that we should define more clearly the respective rights and responsibilities of parents and of the state, in respect of parenthood and in respect of marriage. The Government should, after careful consultation, define more clearly the respective rights and responsibilities of parents and the state for the care and education of the nation's children. They should explore the idea recently canvassed by the National Family & Parenting Institute of having a parents' charter, compact or contract between parents and the state.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para24"></a>Many young people today are surprisingly ignorant about marriage and cohabitation. Research from 2002 shows that 50 per cent of the population incorrectly believe that unmarried people who cohabit have the same legal rights as married people. They do not. Government should take steps to correct young people's misconceptions about marriage. Marriage is not just an excuse for a party. Marriage is not a prop to shore up a failing romantic love affair. Marriage is not admitting defeat or sacrificing individuality but joining forces to be stronger together. It is creating a lifelong commitment with a partner, and it is a sign of maturity and courage. Marriage is a long-term committed partnership in which love can grow and mature.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para25"></a>My third point is that we should work with parents, not against them. Nearly all parents want the best for their child. The Government have&#151;I must make a <P>


<a name="column_276"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>modest criticism&#151;made a major mistake with regard to the family: they have inflated the value of direct state intervention and tended to undermine the influence and confidence of parents. I believe that we should all value, respect and empower parents more and recognise the sacrifices that they make and the tough job that they do raising the nation's children. The state should provide and procure support for parents where and when they want it, and we should find more effective ways to consult parents of all backgrounds and listen to their concerns. We should provide or procure affordable, universally available education in relationships and communication skills at school and later in life. We should provide or procure affordable parenting education and support for all parents where and when they want it, especially around the birth of their first child.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para26"></a>My fourth point is that the state and society should encourage and support healthy marriage. We should foster programmes to educate and help married parents to improve and enrich their relationships. We should foster programmes to inform young people about the nature of marriage and the sacrifices and advantages involved in a long-term commitment through marriage. We should support and encourage changes to make it easier for committed parents to reconcile family responsibilities and the demands of employment. We should find ways to support young men in becoming good fathers and contributors, not just financially but in an emotionally and morally supportive sense, so that their children can be truly proud of them.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para27"></a>Finally, I turn to what is, perhaps, a controversial point. Governments should send strong signals of support to those who serve society. If long-term commitment between parents is best for children and therefore for the nation's future, governments should support those who decide to make that commitment. Words are not enough. At the least, we should consider making personal tax allowances transferable and examine the possibility of some sort of tax breaks or support. We should do so not because it would make a huge financial difference but because it would show parents who had made a long-term commitment to marriage for their own sake and for the sake of their children that we wanted to support them because we recognised that they were doing good for all of us.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para28"></a>So far, I have referred only to the advantages to children and to the state of long-term commitment in marriage. There is another fundamental aspect: the spiritual strength and wholeness that it can bring to those who enter into the marriage commitment. I have run out of time, but I hope that the right reverend Prelates and other noble Lords will speak about the advantages of marriage for parents themselves. I beg to move for Papers.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para29"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, about the importance of bringing up children within a stable marriage, preferably, as he put it, in a long-term, committed and harmonious marriage. A long-term marriage or relationship benefits the adults as well as the children. There is plenty of research to show that people are happiest and healthiest in a long-term stable relationship. I imagine that that is because there are enough other unstable elements in our lives that we must put up with.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para30"></a>Within marriage, such long-term stable relationships are recognised in law and, to a certain extent, encouraged. They are encouraged by the state pension arrangements and by tax allowances between spouses, especially on death. Presumably, that is because they look after each other and are less demanding on the public services. What about long-term stable relationships outside marriage? Sadly, they are discriminated against and not recognised in law.
<P>

<a name="40317-04_para31"></a>Noble Lords may remember the late Lord Montague of Oxford. He entered your Lordships' House in 1997. Sadly, he died three years later. He and his companion were wonderful friends of my family for 25 years. They had that special relationship with my children that adult family friends sometimes have&#151;a relationship free of the baggage that exists between parents and children. Lord Montague and I both worked in business and frequently exchanged ideas. He built up a successful engineering business, which was quoted on the London Stock Exchange. We were both friends of the late John Smith, and we worked together to build up the relationship between the Labour Party and the business community. When Lord Montague died, he and his companion had been together for 32 years. A real "'til death do us part" relationship. But the tax and pension benefits available to a surviving spouse were not available to his companion. They were not available because his companion was male. The home they shared had to be sold, because death duties did not recognise the surviving partner.

<A NAME="40317-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I wonder if I could draw the noble Lord's attention to the fact that the Motion specifically refers to families with children. The object of that was to focus on families with children, rather than on the vexed question of homosexual partnerships and marriage, which I felt would distract from the particular, rather narrower, issue which I hoped the House might wish to debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I apologise if the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, feels I am trespassing on his debate, but I put my name down to speak and prepared this when the Motion on the Order Paper was just a debate about marriage. So I felt that it was relevant then. I would like to continue making this point because I have come to a point the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, mentioned in his speech.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para0"></a>These benefits were not available because his companion was male, and the home that they shared had to be sold because death duties and pension arrangements did not recognise the surviving partner. This is the injustice to which I refer. Does my noble <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>friend the Minister not find this discriminatory, intolerant, lacking in humanity and perhaps a little bit mean spirited? Because I do. But it is not difficult to put it right.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, told us that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, introduced a Civil Partnerships Bill. It had its Second Reading in your Lordships' House on 25 January 2002. The Government indicated that they would introduce their own Bill, and so the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, did not proceed. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, there was some discussion about whether the Government's Bill would apply to same-sex partnerships or heterosexual partnerships, or both. I have established that the Department of Trade and Industry is handling the Bill, and it did briefly surface on 5 February this year in response to a Written Question to the Minster in another place, Jacqui Smith. She said that the Government hope to introduce the civil partnerships Bill into Parliament in this Session. The purpose of my intervention is simple. It is to try to speed it up.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para2"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on moving this debate. He has raised matters of enormous importance. Perhaps it might have been apt if I had said something about children who have been adopted by, or who are living with, same-sex couples. But my purpose is to try to shame the Government into speeding up the introduction of the civil partnerships Bill, because delay means that the injustice continues.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject. I have been married three times and am still married, which does not make me an expert but does make me an addict. If I use the word "marriage" in this debate, I would personally intend it to extend to a civil partnership should we get a Bill on that subject, which I very much hope we will. The essence, to me, is of a public commitment made between two people: a commitment to sharing, to sacrifice when that is necessary and to accommodation with each other. All these words can be quite frightening if you have not experienced them at some stage. People can find commitment and sharing quite difficult, and the idea of sacrificing oneself so that someone else can succeed in something is, in some ways, quite alien to the spirit of our times. So if we are to encourage marriage, we ought to be looking for ways to encourage that sort of attitude in people. The best way to do that is to give people experience of it. The sort of place we ought to be doing that is at school.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para3"></a>I certainly do not mean adding a few days to PSHE lessons and rather dry, didactic teaching about what a marriage should consist of, but giving people actual experience. I suppose that it used to be thought that sports offered such an opportunity but today, by and large, even team sports tend to be looked at as collections of individuals rather than teams. One or two, like rowing, are quite clearly team sports where people do rely on each other enormously. But sports have become a very individual thing. The opportunity is much more apparent in areas like drama, public <P>


<a name="column_279"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>speaking teams and various other extra-curricular activities. There are some very good examples around, where pupils form small teams or groups and really rely on each other to make a success. Keeping the group together, supporting the weaker members of the group, taking your turn and the success of the group are what is important rather than the success of the individual. This is the sort of experience that you can gain from engaging in such activities. We could do more to support such opportunities in schools and make it easier for schools to find and participate in such events. The Department for Education and Skills website is really getting quite good these days. The web is probably the right way in which to go. It would make it easier for schools to find these things and to say "If you're organising something like this, put it up on the website". People will know where to get to it. If someone comes up with an innovative idea that requires a little starting finance to get it running, there should be schemes to allow that to happen.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para4"></a>I should also like to see the return of stories in schools, a long-time favourite subject of mine. I should like to see the return of teaching that is about people and the way people interact, react and behave. It used to be what history was about and, to some extent, what geography was about. Now it is not about people, it is about documents. You build up an understanding of how people are and, particularly, you build up an ambition to be like something, if you are learning about people. There is room for much more of the curriculum to have that slant, rather than a sort of pseudo-scientific approach to history. That has its function, perhaps at A-level, certainly at degree level. But most of us give up history at GCSE, and at GCSE it should be about people.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para5"></a>I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that we should make some public recognition of those people who make a public commitment as it is for the public good that they do such things. We should encourage that. There should be a definite advantage to being married in all its aspects. There should be small tax advantages. One way or another, you should be better off&#151;not enormously, but you should be better off. Again, I would extend that to civil partnerships, as and when we get them.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para6"></a>Beyond that, we are looking at how we can support an environment from which children and parents, in whatever relationship they find themselves, can benefit. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, knows, I am very much in favour of parenting classes. Such things exist, perhaps, but I have never come across them. They are not part of the package you are given when you get a young child, and that is the point when you need to have access to them. I have learnt a great deal from watching on television the noble Lord, Lord Winston, in his programme "A Child of Our Time". It deals with the problems that occur when bringing up children and how to solve those problems when things go wrong. The web is the obvious route to have access to that advice in an easy way and to be able to know where to turn to.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para7"></a>The Government have produced an excellent service, NHS Direct, which I have used several times now. It is just easy. If there is a problem with the kid&#151;it is developing spots or is behaving in a certain way&#151;you ring up, you get treated well and you get an early diagnosis. The whole thing can be done without feeling you have to troop off to the hospital at two o'clock in the morning. You can do it while you are looking after the child in bed and your partner is getting some sleep. That sort of facility, which is easy to use, with someone helpful and interpretative at the other end, would be a useful way to go.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para8"></a>Something else we should try and spread the word about is the joy of parenting&#151;the sheer pleasure to be had from bringing up a child. One thinks of this as a problem for men; indeed, in many cases it is a problem for young men, who do not understand that participating in bringing up a child can be immensely pleasurable. Particularly for those whom my wife spends her time working with in prison, it is a revelation when, in the course of the project that she organises, they come to realise what pleasure they might get from being involved in their child's upbringing and how they can do it well. The problem then is that their womenfolk have become so used to the fathers not being there that they rather resent them saying that they want a role in bringing up the children. None the less, we need to make progress in that direction.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para9"></a>Some good things are being done in schools, where the older children mentor the younger children and help bring them through education. In business life, many of us have been mentors to younger people who need some help making it in the world. But there is a gap; young people in their twenties never really get a chance to mentor school-age pupils, to learn the process of taking pleasure in looking after young children. We have become rather frightened by the prospect of paedophiles and pederasty. The immediate image that that sort of closeness conjures up is one of evil. There was a Coca-Cola cab parked outside the House of Lords when I arrived. It said, "Coca-Cola, the worldwide hug" and had a picture of a lot of people holding hands. If that is what "hug" means these days, we really are in trouble when it comes to understanding the pleasure that can be had with relationships between adults and children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para10"></a>One way in which we might look at this issue is to give extra support to schemes that develop relationships between adults in this country and children in the third world. If they were supported and made easy, and young people were encouraged to get involved, it might give them&#151;or some more of them&#151;a taste of what it means to be involved in bringing up a child and sharing the pleasures of a child's achievements.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para11"></a>Finally, for people bringing up children on their own, it is an extremely hard and lonely business. We need to look at ways of making available to them the sort of support and community which they would get if they were part of a family network of a successful marriage. It strikes me that the people who really have this help to offer are the old. In many instances, the old <P>


<a name="column_281"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are extremely lonely, but still quite capable of support and love. Something ought to be done in terms of the way we organise housing&#151;we should not stick old people in ghettos where all they see are other old people just because it is easier that way. We ought to look at mixing communities, so that old people who are capable and willing to give support find themselves in close proximity to single parents of children, in particular, who would appreciate having that support. Perhaps in that way we can offer opportunities to recreate some sort of informal extended family.

<A NAME="40317-05_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lord Northbourne for initiating this important debate, and for his persistence on this issue. He has dedicated his life to ensuring that as many children as possible in this country are truly wanted and receive the nurturing they need. Marriage can be a means to promoting that goal. If parents have a mechanism by which they can clearly establish that they wish to make a lifetime commitment to one another and to have a child together, the child's prospects must be improved.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para12"></a>This issue must be approached with great sensitivity, of course. Many parents choose not to marry; many children are not born to married parents; many married parents divorce; and many children whose parents are married have a very unhappy time, unfortunately.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para13"></a>Fortunately, the media do a very good job of promoting marriage. In HELLO! magazine, one sees each week so-and-so getting married, with lots of lovely photographs. This is show, I know, but it is popular and it promotes marriage. It is interesting that apparently, more middle-class couples are choosing to marry; it is becoming more fashionable to get married. That is good news.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para14"></a>What other means do the Government have to support parents, families and children? There are many roads, and the Government are vigorously following many of them. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill before the House is part of the Government's strategy to increase the numbers of houses. I believe that there are more families who are statutorily homeless than there were several years ago. When visiting families living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, it is terrible to see the suffering they have to endure in those conditions. I welcome the Government's commitment to improving the supply of housing. I welcome what they are doing with Sure Start, intervening early to support families. I welcome what they are doing in investing in health and education. All this work is so important when it comes to improving outcomes for children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para15"></a>My noble friend referred to a parents' charter. Are the Government being careful to engage with parents as far as possible? I know that Sure Start comes from what the local people in an area want, and I welcome that. However, I should like to highlight the danger of not making sufficient effort to consult with parents.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para16"></a>In other areas where adults take on the role of parents, we have often neglected that role. I am thinking particularly of residential childcare. Until recently in this country, 80 per cent of residential childcare workers, working in children's homes with children who have been neglected and abused, had no relevant qualification, and this was an important parenting role.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para17"></a>We have neglected foster carers for many years and I am very pleased that the Minister is making such determined efforts to improve conditions for them. We had a debate last week on conditions for elderly people with dementia, many of whom are in residential care. It was quite clear in that debate that the staff working in those homes were not adequately prepared for that work. This is an important parenting role, if you like: when people are coming to the end of their life, they are very vulnerable, and it is as if they are parented.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para18"></a>Your Lordships may be surprised at my bringing up the issue of prisons, but 10 per cent of children who go into care have some involvement in the criminal justice system, and more than 50 per cent have experienced abuse or neglect. I am sorry to bombard your Lordships with figures, but, sadly, 50 per cent of children in the criminal justice system have had experience of care, as have 25 per cent of prisoners in the adult population. For many male prisoners, their first experience of the father figure is their relationship with a prison officer. Those who are experienced in this area emphasise how very important those relationships with the prison officers are.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para19"></a>In this country, prison officers have nine weeks' training before they take up their job. Prison officers who work with children have three or four additional days' training. That is deplorable. In Norway, I believe that they have a year's probationary period, a year in a special college, where they study the theory and then they practise in a mock-up prison. They also have opportunities to travel abroad to see how people practise, in England for instance, before they are fully paid-up prison officers.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para20"></a>Martin Narey spoke to members of your Lordships' House yesterday evening. He was disappointed that prison officers receive only these nine weeks of training and pointed out that most probation officers have a degree and postgraduate qualifications. So what is going on here? That is my concern: that in the past these people, with this important parenting role, have been neglected.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para21"></a>I very warmly welcome the Government's child poverty strategy but there has been concern about the emphasis on getting mothers into work&#151;even mothers with very young children. We know that is the best way to get children out of poverty but parents, especially those with very young children, need to be able to choose whether to go to work or whether to care for their children. There has been concern that such a choice has not been made as easily available as it should be, especially given the lack of availability of good-quality childcare. I note with interest that a forthcoming conference, run by the One Parent <P>


<a name="column_283"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Family charity, will concentrate on this issue of parents having the choice of whether to go into work or to care for their children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para22"></a>I recognise the commitment that the Government are making to this country's children, but I would be grateful if the Minister could offer an assurance that the Government really are seeking to engage parents as much as possible. Perhaps the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Northbourne, of a parents' charter, would be one way of encouraging engagement with parents. I thank my noble friend Lord Northbourne for calling this debate and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for introducing a subject of such crucial importance to our society.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para23"></a>Our present society is characterised by a wide range of different kinds of relationships: single parents struggling, very often heroically, to bring up children on their own or people who are cohabiting for a variety of reasons. Some people do not feel quite ready to commit themselves fully; others have had a bad experience, either their own or their parents' experience, and they have been hurt; others are against marriage on principle; and, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, drew to our attention, there are people of the same sex in lifelong partnerships. Why any government should give the marriage relationship a special place in their policy is therefore a very serious, searching question .
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para24"></a>The first and most prosaic reason, of course, is that it is good value for money. We know from the study undertaken by the House of Commons Library that in 1994 the cost of relationship breakdown, in terms of legal costs, court costs, benefit costs, and a whole range of other costs, was in the region of &#163;4 billion. Compare that with the mere &#163;5 million which is put into marriage and relationship support. Simply on economic grounds, therefore, it is clearly very wise and prudent of government to do all they can to prepare people for marriage properly and to support the marriage relationship.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para25"></a>Secondly, and more directly related to the debate, support for children, and more generally the family, crucially is provided through supporting marriage relationships. I am personally very glad to be associated with a number of organisations, such as our own diocesan organisation PACT&#151;Parents and Children Together&#151;the Family Nurturing Network, the Mothers' Union, and so on, all of which are fully committed to supporting good parenting and to supporting families.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para26"></a>We can all agree that children need to be supported in any way possible. That does not divide anybody in this House and I hope nobody in our society. We need to do all we can to support children, whatever the context in which they are growing up. However, research shows that a stable and loving marriage relationship has enormous benefits for the children. The effect of relationship breakdown is shown in the children's poor <P>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>performance: at school very often; leaving school early; difficulty in getting a job; a range of illnesses; themselves getting married too young, and so on.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para27"></a>Under the present government arrangements, MARS&#151;Marriage and Relationship Support&#151;brings together family support and marriage support. The voluntary organisations can see many advantages in this, but it is very important, within that overall field, not to allow support for marriage in any way to be downgraded. As I have tried to suggest, supporting marriage is one of the very best ways in which we can actually support and help children to grow up with the kind of emotional, physical and spiritual health we would like for them.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para28"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has mentioned&#151;I do not have time to develop the thought but I agree with a great deal of what he said&#151;we cannot separate support for marriage from wider considerations of economic policy, social policy and political policy, in a whole range of areas. This is a subject which includes the whole gamut of government departments and government policies.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para29"></a>We need to do all we can to support those organisations, bodies and institutions which are trying not only to support family life but also to support committed relationships. I was very struck recently to read of a new initiative by One Plus One called "Couples Direct", which is an interactive Internet service. Its research has shown that marriage preparation and marriage support, whether done by Churches or anybody else, is extremely patchy, not always accessible to people, and that the vast majority of people who need it probably do not draw on it. They are therefore trying to make marriage support more accessible and more user-friendly through this interactive Internet service. It seemed to me to be a very valuable initiative.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para30"></a>First, there are therefore the economic benefits of supporting marriage and, secondly, the crucial importance as far as children are concerned of long-term, committed, stable, loving relationships.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para31"></a>I now come to my third point, which is a rather more difficult one to make. At the heart of marriage is the idea of a clear, public, lifetime commitment. From a Christian perspective, this commitment reflects a fundamental commitment or covenant between God and humanity. That is symbolised most beautifully in the Hebrew scriptures by the great overarching rainbow after Noah's flood. It is a sign of God's undeviating good will, unswerving love for humanity as a whole and a covenant into which the people of Israel consciously entered; and from a Christian point of view a covenant which comes to its focus in Jesus in whom earth and heaven are joined, never to be unjoined.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para32"></a>The Church has always held out the wonderful ideal that the relationships of men and women at their best should reflect that covenant of God and humanity that runs through the different marriage services. The marriage relationship is meant to reflect that covenant of God and humanity. I believe that it is right that the <P>


<a name="column_285"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>law of our country, or any country, should have a high ideal of that relationship expressed in one way or another through its public policy and through its laws.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para33"></a>A few years ago there was a famous debate between Lord Devlin and H.L.A. Hart, the philosopher, on the relationship between morality and law. Lord Devlin's point was that nothing in life is value-free or neutral and that the law of every country reflects, through its history, culture and religion, a particular understanding of marriage. So it is in this country.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para34"></a>I suppose the question arises of why we should continue to give marriage a very special place in our law and public policy. Marriage belongs to all human beings; it is not an invention of the Christian Church. In fact, the Church of England believes that when two people make promises to each other in public that brings about a marriage. You do not have to be in church to get married. Of course we would love everyone to come to church to receive God's blessing upon their marriage; and Jesus performed his first miracle at Cana of Galilee. As a character in one of Dostoevsky's novels said, Jesus performed his miracle to increase people's joy.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para35"></a>However, many people today get married in register offices. Of course those are valid marriages. From the Church's point of view I believe that we should support the work of registrars, who do all they can to prepare people for marriage properly and who also indicate to them the kind of help they can get. In that connection, I ask the Minister when we shall hear more from the Government about what is going to be asked of registrars under the new dispensation to Parliament of the regulatory reform order and explanatory document. The Church of England is also revising its laws on marriage and it would be interesting to know exactly where the Government stand on that. Therefore, whether marriages take place in a Church or in register offices we need to do all we can to support them.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para36"></a>I move on to a slightly more difficult point. I bear in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said. I totally accept that people of the same or opposite sex cohabit and live wonderfully mutually supportive and loving lives. There is absolutely no doubt about it. In many cases they put married relationships to shame. From a philosophical point of view, however, I would say that those relationships are in some way parasitic upon publicly stated vows, above all the vows of marriage. After all, when people enter into cohabitation, in their hearts in some way or another they want to make those kind of life-long vows. The fact is that most young people still want to get married. Even people who have divorced, although they have had a bad experience, still would like to find the right person to whom they can make a lifetime commitment.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para37"></a>So, I do not think that the Government should be timid or frightened about continuing to maintain in the law of this country a very special place for marriage. I do not think that it denigrates other relationships which in their own way can be very special, and from which we can learn.
<P>

Indeed, long before I was privileged to join your Lordships' House, I have since discovered that the noble Lord instituted many debates on marriage and the importance of the role of fathers and so on. Since I have been here, he has certainly continued to keep our minds firmly focused on these subjects through a number of different means.

<a name="40317-05_para38"></a>If I look back over my lifetime&#151;it is a shock to realise just how long that now covers&#151;I am amazed at the changes that have taken place in the pattern of domestic family life. I refer not just to changes but also to diversification.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para39"></a>At the start of my adult life&#151;now half a century ago&#151;marriage was certainly the conventional norm; the norm for young people from all walks of life, wishing to start a life together and raise children. It was the norm not just for them but for their neighbours as well and it lasted, in most cases, for the rest of their lives.

<a name="40317-05_para40"></a>I was powerfully reminded of this the other day when I looked again at the 1957 seminal research by Michael Young and Peter Willmot, Family and Kinship in East London. Your Lordships will recall their brilliant description of the everyday built-in extended family support systems that then prevailed and the extent to which those were weakened as the younger generations moved out to the new housing estates in the suburbs. But what for me today is most significant about that book is that from beginning to end the term used is "marriage"&#151;certainly not "cohabitation".
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para41"></a>That is clearly not the case today. We seem to have moved from an almost total marriage convention&#151;sustained by fairly draconian divorce laws&#151;to a situation where far fewer young people actually marry; 13 per cent of women between 18 and 49 were cohabiting in 1998&#151;up from 8 per cent 10 years previously. If they do decide to marry it will be considerably later&#151;most probably only at the long delayed moment in their thirties and sometimes their forties when they decide to start a family. Even for those who do marry, divorce&#151;with or without remarriage&#151;is increasingly common, as we have already heard&#151;and, all too often while their children are still young. Like it or not, the trend towards cohabitation and more frequent divorce is here to stay. Almost 30 per cent of children experience divorced parents by the time they reach 16 years.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para42"></a>Of course many factors have been at work to bring this about. The divorce laws have been relaxed considerably. The stigma of divorce that once kept many couples together has almost disappeared. Women, who in the "old days" more often than not had no other means of support for themselves and their children but their husband's income, are now a considerable part of the workforce and are either in jobs or able to return to employment relatively easily.

<P>

<a name="40317-05_para43"></a>Since the 1970s and the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts women have far greater economic independence. "Women's Lib" really did liberate women in this country. Sadly, we have heard of other countries where it has not done so in the same way. It included liberation from the ties of broken marriages. That may be seen perhaps from the fact that women initiate seven out of 10 divorces.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para44"></a>Of course a number of other factors have worked in the same direction: the liberalising effect of the pill; the lack of social stigma in having children "out of wedlock"; the fact that many of the younger generation earn considerably more than their parents; and the fact that people now wish to "enjoy life" before settling down later than used to be the case&#151;considerably later, incidentally. A great deal is explained, is it not, by some of those happenings?
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para45"></a>Even so, we need to remind ourselves that by no means all those changes are bad. Your Lordships would not expect me to say they were, not least with my interest in equal opportunities over many years. In the past, there were far too many appalling cases of women locked into violent, nightmarish marriages who did not dare to complain. There were also cases of women who unwillingly had abortions or put children up for adoption. I listened to a number of those cases and worried about them. Women today can be spared that kind of anguish as a direct result of changes in attitudes.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para46"></a>Even so, many Members of this House, of which I am certainly one, continue to believe that the institution of marriage is the best way in which to bring up children and that it is the most likely way to succeed. We believe that it is the best way to provide the mutual love, support and background that are so important for the development of young human beings.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para47"></a>However, we can, and should, do far more to promote the value of the institution of marriage to young people. The Government's 2002 report Moving Forward Together rightly makes clear their intention to improve the delivery of marriage and relationship support services. I believe that it identified 10 areas for future development and action. The Government's intention was confirmed in a reply to a Parliamentary Question from David Kidney MP in another place a little while ago. Perhaps when she replies the Minister will be kind enough to bring us up to date on what has been achieved so far.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para48"></a>In tackling this question, it is important to be realistic about the situation on the ground. Like it or not, the trend towards cohabitation and more frequent divorce is as I have already mentioned. So we should, and must promote&#151;via parent contracts; citizenship classes; in schools, where action is possible very early indeed; and by other means&#151;a true understanding of marriage as a long-term commitment and as the best possible way to bring up children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para49"></a>It is also vital that we give far greater respect and priority to the important role of parents. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and other noble Lords have said, we need to listen to what parents want. It is very <P>


<a name="column_288"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fashionable today to consult and listen to many groups including, rightly, children but, sadly, parents do not seem to be a high priority.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para50"></a>Far more authoritative research is needed on the effect of family break-up on children. There is not much research on that subject.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para51"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, also said, we are facing a long battle. We are not likely to turn back the clock completely, however long and hard we try. Above all, we must think about what else we can do to mitigate the damage that is beyond doubt inflicted by the family conflicts and poor parenting that can flow from the decline in the institution of marriage.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para52"></a>As I know all too well from my many years in juvenile courts, Moving Forward Together rightly identified family conflicts and poor parenting as key risk factors for adolescent problems of drug abuse, youth crime, school-age pregnancy, school failure, mental health problems and homelessness. In other words, we must try much harder to prevent the social exclusion of such young people. The Government want to achieve that; indeed, we all do.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para53"></a>A good start has been made by our increasingly firm commitment, as expressed by the Government on our behalf, to put the interests of the child first. We have excellent programmes such as Sure Start. As the Minster knows, I am enthusiastic about Sure Start and many other noble Lords are clearly enthusiastic about it too. At last, we have a Children Bill, even if that Bill does not yet contain all the powers that some of us hope for, and a proposed child commissioner for England.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para54"></a>But should we not now be looking harder for new ways of harnessing the extended family? As has already been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, we are all living much longer and healthier lives. The voluntary sector has long played a crucial role in sustaining cohesive communities. Today, those of us who have arrived at what might euphemistically be called "the retirement age" are, and should be, an increasingly obvious target for voluntary organisations to recruit to help to provide active and experienced support for failing families. Home Start is a good example of that.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para55"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, also mentioned grandparents&#151;if he did not, I am sure that he intended to do so. It remains an absurd situation that grandparents, who are immensely willing to take charge of grandchildren in the sad event of a family breakdown, find themselves less adequately resourced to do that job than they would be as foster parents. With the right practical, as well as financial support, we know that many more grandparents would be willing to take charge of grandchildren.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para56"></a>Returning to the Wilmot and Young description of family life, surely what we need is a new form of extended kinship support. In some cases, perhaps we even need to be able to make use of the wider familial network that can arise as a result of several marriages and co-habitations.

<a name="40317-05_para57"></a>Making it possible for parents to have time to spend with their children is, perhaps, most important of all. Here I am referring to the vital need to rearrange all working patterns in sufficiently flexible ways to allow parenting to be effective parenting. I refer not just to women's working patterns but to patterns for both sexes.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para58"></a>The future citizens of this country are our responsibility, whether we have children of our own or not. Above all, as we plan for the future, we need to remember that the UK is a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is therefore committed to work towards what is best for each child.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para59"></a>The institution of marriage is still the best, even if not the only, means of achieving that objective. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has done us a great service in reminding us of that principle. This should be our guiding principle in all that we try to do.

<A NAME="40317-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, we must all be in a permanent state of gratitude to my noble friend Lord Northbourne for yet again giving us an opportunity to emphasise the importance of marriage, the family and the upbringing of children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para60"></a>Marriage is never easy. It is not always a bed of roses; there is the odd thorn. Sometimes it does not work out and that is a sadness for everyone concerned. There are many reasons why it collapses, but the trouble is that we are all human beings and none of us is perfect. Sometimes when everyone is trying hard, it still does not work out. 
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para61"></a>As a family, we have all been very lucky. My parents were happily married for 46 years, and at every anniversary my father would quote how long they had been married, and say, "In all that time we have had only one fight", and then he would add, "of course, we do have an armistice now and then". We celebrated their ruby wedding in this House in 1968 with a small party. Our ruby wedding was also celebrated here with children and grandchildren, pages and bridesmaids, and the best man. I made a three-tier cherry wedding cake but somehow I got the mechanics wrong and the top tier flew off to be caught by Miss McWilliam. My middle sister celebrated her ruby wedding on a cruise and we had a family ruby dinner for my youngest sister here last December. We went for gold in 1952, and so did my husband's parents in 1966. That is so much for which to thank God. If I did not collapse into sleep at night I would still be praying.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para62"></a>Families are at the heart of everything. They are that small warm place that you retreat to when you can think of nothing else. Those of us with happy childhoods and happy families always have some place that we can retreat to when all else goes wrong. The world can be a big cold place, and what everyone needs is one place where they can throw off their hat, take off their shoes and know that give or take, and despite all the criticism and advice, everyone is on their side.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para63"></a>There are fashions in morality, in commitment between two people. Fashions change just like clothes; they come and go like the tide. I read recently that today's teenagers are all for marriage, against teenage pregnancies and for children being brought up in a family. The tide is turning. For the tide is part of the sea and that does not change.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para64"></a>Marriage is like the sea, one of the eternal values, which does not change, though it has fashions like the tide. Better and worse tend to get mixed up. Richer must be nice, though poorer is what we usually end up with. With luck we have quite a bit of health, though sickness is always lurking round the corner. But for the mutual society, help and comfort one cannot beat marriage, nor as a means of bringing up children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para65"></a>Marriage has been going on for a long time, as long as there were people. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford mentioned the marriage at Cana in Galilee. An old cousin, Albert Baillie, who used to be Dean of Windsor, said when he married us that it was no accident that the first miracle occurred at a marriage&#151;at Cana in Galilee. It was simply putting the importance of marriage first.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para66"></a>The cycle of marriage is the cycle of life&#151;you start as a child and grandchild, you end up as a parent and grandparent. But throughout life there is a commitment at both ends. Marriage anniversaries start close together with paper and flowers and wood, but after the 15th year with crystal and glass&#151;very useful too after the wedding presents have all got smashed and there are no longer six of everything&#151;they stretch out to every five years. Twenty is china, which fills a splendid gap. Perhaps they are celebrated every five years because time has already begun to whiz; you are always living through tomorrow before yesterday has even finished.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para67"></a>My husband and I are working up to 52 years and many of your Lordships have much longer to celebrate. When I go to the AGM of the War Widows Association at the end of this month, I am always conscious of how short a time of happiness they had together and it makes me count my own blessings. We have also been blessed with children who are nearly all married themselves and we have the joy of grandchildren. Many of my noble friends share this joy with grandchildren, great-nephews and great-nieces and godchildren. Happiness is hearing four year-old Alfred say: "Excuse me, Grandma, will you read me another story?". However, I have my fingers crossed for next Friday when my 13 year-old French granddaughter, Pelagie, is bringing 65 of her French school friends to tour the Palace of Westminster. Watch this space, as the advertisements say.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para68"></a>Last month, I was with the Arts and Heritage Group in the Royal Academy looking at 15th-century Flemish and Burgundian Books of Hours. There were many visions of people suffering the torments of hell. But there did seem to be one or two escape routes through purgatory for which I felt one might qualify: "The good but not so good", "The bad but not so bad" and "The long and faithfully married". I think there is hope for all of us there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spnew7"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Leicester: </B>   My Lords, I too welcome the opportunity for debate provided by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. He is right to say that healthy marriages are good for children and adults and to point to the importance of supporting marriage and enhancing awareness of its benefits. Whoever said that marriage was not so much a noun as a sentence got it badly wrong. Marriage remains the major institution of family life, upheld by the teachings of the Churches and other faith communities and the values of civil society. The Churches believe that marriage is a gift from God to the whole of creation, which enables the whole human family to flourish and not just those who are themselves married.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para69"></a>The Church of England in its response to the Government's consultation document Supporting Families recognised the lack of consensus in society about marriage and family life and the difficult task of helping government to forge constructive policies to support families. However, it went on to say this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have argued that families are simultaneously public and private institutions . . .  But it is simply not possible to have a 'value free' or neutral policy . . .  An ideological commitment to pluralism, which rules out any possibility of one family form being judged better than another, provides an inadequate basis for developing a sound family policy."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para70"></a>
The response of the Church of England went on to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"urge the Government to develop its family policy with a clear commitment to the support of marriage as its basis."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para71"></a><P>

<a name="40317-05_para72"></a>There remains a reluctance to prioritise one family form over another. We face a problem here in perceiving as mutually exclusive support of marriage and other forms of family life, including individuals in situations of hardship. In reality, marriage needs to be supported alongside parental relationships outside marriage for the benefit of children and adults within all family situations.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para73"></a>We need a framework that recognises the institution of marriage and the reality of those who do not choose it, for both are part of the fabric of our society. We need a family policy towards children with clear commitment to supporting marriage as its bedrock while addressing the realities that we encounter in society. With its clear teaching on marriage and family life, the Church can be seen as standing for an ideal while at the same time serving in an enormous variety of ways individuals and communities for whom this is not an option. The Church is involved in supporting marriage and in working with those who are victims of broken relationships, both in marriage and other family patterns.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para74"></a>In a confused society there are three particular contributions which those of us outside government can make to the national understanding of marriage. First, we need better teaching about the nature of marriage. The bishops of the Church of England in their recent teaching document have said that there is a great deal in our culture which discourages us from making binding and public promises. That is undoubtedly a difficult thing to do and requires courage but the promises are an important part of entering marriage.
<P>


<a name="column_292"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para75"></a>If love is to grow, it needs an explicit commitment of the couple to stay with each other through changing circumstances, through personal development and growth and through the process of growing older and approaching death. But the promises are also liberating. Through them we focus our intentions and offer one another a shared future in a way that we could hardly dare to do otherwise. By making our promises in public, we call on a community of well-wishers to support us in our resolve to be a couple, an important assistance in a culture that is generally unsupportive to any kind of commitment.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para76"></a>Secondly, there is much that many of us can do in contributing towards preparation of couples for the married state. The Church invests considerable resources in this kind of preparation for marriage and in supporting people in their married lives. Over 90 per cent of marriage preparation&#151;a major aspect of relationship support and education&#151;is conducted by the voluntary sector. A great majority of this is carried out by the Churches, including the Church of England, often in partnership with other agencies such as Relate. This provides secure, well-managed occasions for couples to discuss their subconscious impressions of marriage implanted at an early age by their own parents. Such discussions are often a way to address relationship problems which can otherwise surface later in life in a much more troublesome way. This points us to the need not just for marriage preparation but also for marriage exploration&#151;ongoing packages of support for people that enable relationships to last for a lifetime.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para77"></a>We need an understanding of marriage as a process not just an event. We may need to see that cohabitation might for some be part of that process by which couples explore marriage, demanding similar social obligations as a formally married couple. We need to recognise better the work of organisations involved in marriage and relationship support. Despite the increasing rise in the rate of divorce and the added choice couples now have on where they are married and by whom, the Church of England still conducts about 25 per cent of marriage ceremonies a year. In the year 2000, 65,000 couples were married according to the rites of the Church of England.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para78"></a>Thirdly, we need to do more to support the victims of relationship breakdown and especially of marriage breakdown. For example, the Children's Society estimates that some 100,000 children, some as young as six, run away from home or from care each year and risk being attacked on the streets. In partnership with the Churches, the Children's Society has established family mediation programmes and schools education packs to prevent children running away. It has developed outreach work and drop-in centres to get them off the streets if they do run. Safe emergency accommodation is available and missing persons interviews can be conducted when the police return children home to find out what made them run in the first place.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para79"></a>These are examples of practical support for children that go beyond gesture politics. Verbal support for marriage and the family is easily given but concern for <P>


<a name="column_293"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>marriage often comes too late. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford pointed out, the cost of picking up the pieces of broken relationships resulting from demands made on health resources, social security and social services, legal aid, court, tax and benefits, is enormous.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para80"></a>The crucial point that needs to emerge from this debate is the need for clearer government policy towards supporting married relationships. The bishops' teaching has stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By marriage a new unit of society is created: a couple, stronger than the sum of its members, held together by the bond of domestic friendship. Together the couple can extend love to other people . . .  Their love enables them to make a strong contribution to society so that the weakening of marriage has serious implications for the mutual belonging and care that is exercised within the community at large".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para81"></a>
It is, therefore, vital for all of us that the Government support marriage, as well as parental relationships more generally, because of its crucial role in providing a basis for bringing up children, as well as further benefits for the couple and for wider society as a whole.

<A NAME="40317-05_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I should like to join with others in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for initiating this very interesting and important debate.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para82"></a>I also have to declare an interest. I cannot claim 52 years of successful marriage, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Strange, but I can claim 42 years of successful marriage. I am the product of a happy marriage that itself lasted for more than 55 years and provided a happy family background for four.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para83"></a>The debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, concerns the role of marriage in securing the well-being of the nation's children and their parents in the 21st century. As he said, he is not trying to persuade those who are not married to do so, but he nevertheless argued both that the framework of marriage provides a bulwark to support long-term relationships that are so important, and that the state might encourage marriage through tax incentives and similar policies of support for the process of marriage. That theme has been echoed by a number of speakers, including the two right reverend Prelates. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester has just said that the Government should provide a clearer, more overt policy to support marriage.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para84"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, quoted from a publication issued in 2002 by what is now the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but was then the Lord Chancellor's Department, Moving Forward Together. A paragraph in that publication points very clearly to the importance for children of long-term stable relationships. The document states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a significant relationship between parental experiences and the outcomes experienced by children once they reach adulthood. In general, children brought up by birth parents experience the lowest levels of conflict and early difficulty. Children brought up by two birth parents until the age of 16 have higher levels of life satisfaction and more family support, fewer psychological problems and less conflict at every age".

<a name="column_294"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Conversely, the report concludes:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Parental conflict is an important influence on a number of adverse outcomes in both intact and separated families".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para86"></a>
There are knock-on effects for children even in families that stay together if there is parental conflict.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para87"></a>The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a greater probability of poor outcomes for children from separated families than others. Outcomes for children who have suffered disruption and multiple family structures are worse than for those living continuously with a lone parent or step family. Constant changes to residence and contact arrangements have a particularly negative impact. A 'bad' divorce or relationship breakdown is therefore particularly likely to affect children adversely".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para88"></a><P>

<a name="40317-05_para89"></a>As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford stressed, the costs of family breakdown are substantial. The House of Commons Library put them at &#163;4 billion to &#163;5 billion a while back. In Greater London alone the cost for the police and social security services of responding to domestic violence is put at &#163;278 million.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para90"></a>The position that these Benches adopt is that it is not for the state to lay down moral rules. The role of the state is to give people the opportunity to fulfil themselves in any way they choose as long as, in the process, they do not harm others. But what becomes clear from the debate that we have had is that in the process of marriage breakdown children may be harmed. That in itself provides a case for legitimate intervention on the part of the state. In that respect these Benches have backed a succession of children Acts from the 1948 Act onwards. I am delighted that we now have a Children Bill to bring these procedures up to date. These Benches support many aspects of that Bill.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para91"></a>It seems to me that in all respects the role of the state is to encourage but not to compel, to provide practical help but not to preach. Therefore, our emphasis is not on marriage per se but on the means of providing the safe, secure, loving long-term relationships that children need. It is the quality of the relationship that is the key issue rather than the precise legal institutional framework of that relationship.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para92"></a>That said, I think that one can perhaps exaggerate the degree to which there has been a breakdown of relationships. I was interested in evidence produced by Kathleen Kiernan of the Department of Social Policy and Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion, London School of Economics in an article that appeared in Population Trends in the summer of 1999. On cohabitation across western Europe she stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We found little evidence that pre-marital cohabitants in their first union are more likely to experience marital breakdown than those who marry directly. Pre-marital cohabitation may be an effective way of selecting out partnerships with an enhanced risk of breakdown . . .  Undoubtedly, the evidence from this and other studies show that most European countries are experiencing changes in the ways that men and women become couples, but whether countries are on a trajectory to an ultimate destination where marriage and cohabitation are largely indistinguishable or even where cohabitation overtakes marriage as the dominant form of union awaits the future".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-05_para93"></a><P>

<a name="40317-05_para94"></a>On balance, the evidence still suggests that most people will spend most of their lives in a family environment. I will sum up some of the statistics.
<P>


<a name="column_295"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para95"></a>There are 16 million families in Britain and 11.7 million children. Four fifths of those dependent children live in a family with two parents. Four out of 10 babies are now born outside marriage, but many of those parents go on to marry later. Two in five marriages are likely to end in divorce, but, again, people remarry. One in four children is likely to experience the break up of their parents' marriage by their 16th birthday. That statistic was quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. It is the most frightening statistic. If that break-up is violent and leads to distress, there are problems that knock on for the children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para96"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester quoted the fact that each year 1,000 children run away from home because they are frightened of what is going on there. We know from the experience of Childline that many children ring up who are enormously distressed by their parents quarrelling with each other.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para97"></a>The problems caused by the break-up of relationships and the development of new relationships should also concern us. In the earlier quote that I gave, the problems of the multiple break-up and complex relationships should not be underestimated.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para98"></a>In a school where I was a governor for some time, we had a number of children from disturbed homes. I remember the reception class teacher talking to me about one young lad. She talked about school being an oasis of stability in a very turbulent little life, where the mother was likely to have different boyfriends from week to week and where the child was sometimes loved and sometimes not loved. We know that such relationships later on create children who are disruptive in school, drop out of school and cause all kinds of problems. If possible, we want to be able to intervene on such relationships and prevent those problems emerging.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para99"></a>Yesterday I attended a meeting organised by the group against corporal punishment. They had invited Professor Joan Durrant, a Canadian academic who has made a special study of the effect of the abolition of corporal punishment in Sweden. In this country we are experiencing an increase in hooliganism, youth theft, drug use and drug-related problems. If Professor Durrant's statistics are to be believed, Sweden has experienced a substantial drop in all of those over the past two years.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para100"></a>The most significant thing that she said was this: "Do you know that when a child is born in Sweden the parents are provided with an enormous amount of information and help with bringing up that child? When I had my first child, did anybody talk to me about how I should bring it up? Did the doctor or the midwife talk to me? No. You learn about the little baby, but nothing more&#151;not about how to cope with the terrible twos, the seven year-old or the 13 year-old."
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para101"></a>That struck a bell with me. Parenting classes need to be pursued when there is a captive audience. The right reverend Prelate is right. We need to teach people more about bringing up children&#151;and this is the point when we should do it.

<a name="40317-05_para102"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. We should put more effort into parenting and teaching parents about the importance of stable relationships.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on instigating this highly valuable and significant debate. One cannot say that it is timely, because it is timeless and always of consequence and concern to many of us.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para103"></a>Marriage has been for me a wonderful experience and I have been blessed with 53 years of amazing happiness and contentment. I appreciate that I have indeed been fortunate, and I hope that it does not sound smug to say that both my sons have extremely happy marriages, and my elder son has passed the 25-year mark. I am therefore a strong believer in the institution and value the satisfaction that it can bring to all members of the family.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para104"></a>Some would say that, with such limited experience, I am not the one to speak on this subject. However, I am acutely aware of the difficulties experienced by those who have not been so lucky and find themselves having to raise their children alone.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para105"></a>I think that raising children with two "live in" parents in the same home helps to give children that stability which is, and has been throughout the centuries, essential to enable them to thrive and develop. I could weep for those children who live out of a suitcase, spending half of each week with one parent and the next half with the other. Often each parent has formed a new relationship, and there may be other children from different liaisons, so that the child can become bemused and disorientated as to where home really is. I cannot think of a more confusing background in which to grow up&#151;being tossed from one to the other. Sadly, my father died when I was 10, so I grew up in a single parent family. I really believe that it was for me a more stable atmosphere than being pulled and pushed in all directions.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para106"></a>In July 1994, I had the privilege of piloting the Marriage Bill through this House, which allowed weddings to take place outside a conventional venue&#151;though, as we stressed at the time, the location had to be appropriate and dignified. I enjoyed the experience and hoped that it would be a small gesture in bolstering the tradition of marriage.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para107"></a>Sadly, statistics reveal that today more than 40 per cent of marriages end in divorce, and in 2002 the number of divorces granted was 160,000, with the average length of the marriage only nine years. That says to me that in less than 10 years of marriage, 320,000 young people&#151;bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, full of hope&#151;have become disenchanted, and many, in spite of all the difficulties of caring for young children, have decided to lead separate lives.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para108"></a>Of course, the choices available to young people today are very different from when I was young. More women work, earn their own money and want to pursue their own careers. They are having children <P>


<a name="column_297"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>later in life, and fewer of them. For some, marriage does not seem to be such an obvious and desirable path as it once was.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para109"></a>I want to stress the idea of a stable family relationship being the essential environment in which to raise a child. Children from permanent, secure and strong family units are more likely to leave school with qualifications. They have the loving support of their parents to help them through school, university and perhaps even raising their families. This support is stronger when it comes from two parents who live together in the same house.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para110"></a>It is the breakdown of the relationship between parents, be they married or not, that causes unhappiness and distress for children. This distress can manifest itself in many ways. Of the 60,000 children living in care, 98 per cent are there due to family breakdown. Aside from the huge cost to the taxpayer, it is worth bearing in mind that 39 per cent of all male prisoners under the age of 21 have been in care.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para111"></a>At the same time, young people are maturing much more quickly. The number of girls having under-age sex in this country had doubled in the past 10 years and in 2000 there were 98,000 teenage conceptions. Abortion rates nearly doubled between 1971 and 2000. It seems to me that the quality of life for many young people today is poorer and certainly much harder than it was. Truancy is up, as well as anti-social behaviour, crime, drug addiction and violence.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para112"></a>Being a parent today is a tough and difficult task. One of the figures that I found shocking when researching this speech was that during May 2002, more than 900 "truancy sweeps" were carried out. Twelve thousand children were stopped and about half of these were accompanied by a parent. If parents actively encourage their children not to attend school, then perhaps it is because neither do they see education as important, nor the state as helping them or their children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para113"></a>The rise in the number of pupils excluded from school is another area I would like to touch on as I feel that education is of absolutely vital importance to all children. According to figures from the Department for Education and Skills, released in May 2003, permanent exclusions in England increased by 4 per cent from 9,135 in 2000&#150;01 to 9,540 in 2001&#150;02. More parents appealed against expulsions in 2001&#150;02 compared with the year before, but the proportion that were successful fell from 32 per cent to 24 per cent. We need to keep these children in some form of schooling and address the problems of disruption, violence and truancy by helping parents and their children to understand that education is crucial, rather than alienating them. Stable families are more likely to produce stable children and a strong parental influence will ease the burden on teachers, care workers and, therefore, the state.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para114"></a>I believe that we need to do as much as possible to make life as easy as possible for parents, as they face the daunting challenges of raising children. Times have <P>


<a name="column_298"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changed and we have to be progressive and open-minded, but not at the expense of the wellbeing of children today. Relationships last longer when they are not put under pressure, whether financial or social.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para115"></a>I, too, want to mention taxation. Apart from anything else, our taxation system no longer favours married couples. The married couple's tax allowance was replaced in 2000 by a children's tax credit which enables people with one or more children under 16 to reduce their income tax bill by up to &#163;520. There is, therefore, no financial incentive to be married, unless one has children. Of course, financial reasons should not be cause alone to enter into marriage, but, as my noble friend Lord Lucas said, any encouragement we can provide should not be ignored.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para116"></a>Finally, I feel I should finish on an upbeat note. Many speakers have looked at the surrounding problems of marriage. But my message is one of optimism and hope that with the right encouragement and support many more parents will be able to enjoy the contentment, companionship and pleasure of a long and flourishing relationship within marriage.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-05_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, I join all noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for initiating this debate. I cannot compete with the longevity of your Lordships' marriages, but I declare an interest as a married woman, a parent and a step-parent. I hope that to that extent I bring a little experience to the debate.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para117"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, covered a great deal of ground and, as always, he focused on his desire to support children. I pay tribute to him for that. Like him, the Government and I recognise that marriage is the surest foundation for raising children. The stability, love and support for children that we wish to see in all relationships between adults who have children should be paramount and we recognise the importance of marriage in that.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para118"></a>However, I noticed that the noble Lord also seemed to be saying that, on the one hand, the state needs to be part of the solution by providing the support while, on the other hand, criticising the state for taking away responsibility. I do not believe that we have taken away responsibility, but I accept that the support we provide is critical to enable our children to flourish.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para119"></a>My noble friend Lord Haskel spoke with passion and I will ensure that his comments are passed on. He will be aware that we announced in the Queen's Speech on 26 November our intention to bring forward a civil partnership Bill. I will ensure that his comments are taken forward.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who described himself as an addict, is a good example of someone who recognises the importance of marriage and I will pay regard to his comments about education as I continue my remarks.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para121"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, talked about the need to engage parents. That is a critical part of the agenda, and one we have neglected in terms of our development and thinking, which I am sure we will be able to debate more fully. The right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Oxford talked interestingly about the good value for money, with which I agree, that marriage brings. But there is also the recognition of marriage and relationship support and the role and work of the voluntary sector in particular. The right reverent Prelate asked me how we are going to make clear what we are doing in relation to the regulatory reform order on registrars. We are considering the consultation responses and we are putting proposals before Parliament to be in place before the Summer Recess.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, reminded us of the extended families and the work of Michael Young, taking us through the changes that have taken place since the 1950s and the vast range of experience that we now have of family relationships. She spoke also in the context of her own experience.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para123"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Strange, spoke with emotion of what we all yearn for in marriage&#151;that one place, the total support, the caring for each other, and the need to instil those values in our children. I offer her good luck when the 65 children come to the Palace of Westminster next week.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para124"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester spoke of the importance of the contribution of those outside government, in particular better teaching about marriage, preparation for marriage and support for victims of relationship breakdowns. I echo his sentiments in all of those areas.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para125"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, brings support from the Benches of the Liberal Democrats to the work we are doing on supporting children and recognises the role of marriage within that. The noble Baroness talked about the quality of marriage, which is critical. I, too, am interested in what is happening in countries such as Sweden. HomeStart is an interesting example of what is happening here and, in a sense, emulates what is happening in Sweden.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para126"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, raised in particular the difficulties for children in adapting to changes that happen in their life when there is a breakdown and the critical importance of stability. I could not agree more.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para127"></a>It is always an indication of the importance of the subject when one has the breadth of debate that we have had today. In response, I want to set out the Government's strong commitment to supporting our children and families. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, strong families are at the heart of our strong communities. Successful and confident parenting is essential if we are to create healthy families. We know the importance of good parenting and good family relationships to children's chances of success in later life. As I said, the Government believe that marriage is the surest foundation for raising children and it remains the choice of the majority of people in Britain.
<P>


<a name="column_300"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para128"></a>Our aim is to make the support available for parents and carers at the heart of our approach to improving outcomes for children and of developing more and better universal services open to all families as and when they need it.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para129"></a>As the right reverend Prelates the Bishop of Oxford and the Bishop of Leicester said, it is important. I hope that this investment, in combination with the integration of a wide range of family support services, will go some way towards widening access to support and removing the stigma of seeking help.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para130"></a>We recognise that parents are the most important influence on children and young people. Parenting, as noble Lords have indicated, can be challenging and the majority of parents want help at some stage. By enabling parents to access early support and deal with problems before they become acute we can improve outcomes. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the need to involve parents in our discussions. Work is under way across the department to bring together our work with parents in the broadest sense, and to enable us to consult and discuss such issues more fully with them.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para131"></a>We share the belief that has been expressed in your Lordships' House, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, said, that stability in a couple's relationship is the best foundation for raising children and protecting them from the wide range of risks and negative outcomes. We hope that by bringing together in one department, the Department for Education and Skills, responsibility for policy and services for children, young people and their families, the Government should now be able to respond more easily to the needs of children and families in providing appropriate, accessible and timely support at all of the key stages in the lives of families.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para132"></a>The Moving Forward Together strategy report for marriage and relationship support recommended supporting couples at times of challenge and crisis. Convinced by the evidence, leading researchers are now moving beyond the basic question of whether parents and their relationship affect their children's well-being, to questions about interventions and the impact they have on families as a whole and children in particular. For example, in a study by One Plus One, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the birth of the first child, while of course a time of great joy, can also be challenging. Existing research indicates an emerging trend that many couples report a drop in marital satisfaction upon the birth of their first baby. So, initiatives such as Brief Encounters, which trains and equips health visitors and midwives with the necessary skills to identify potential relationship problems during their statutory home visits&#151;and act as a referral route to enable parents to access a range of support services at that early stage&#151;are critically important in the support that we provide for families.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para133"></a>We recognise that the missing link in our preventive policies has been a serious focus on supporting families, relationships, carers and parents. We want to shift the balance towards prevention, through tackling child poverty, improving the work in early years' education and childcare, raising school standards and <P>


<a name="column_301"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supporting families and parents. We know, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, that family relationships and parenting have a critical influence on educational potential and increasing a child's health chances.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para134"></a>But not enough attention has been paid to how the state, working with the voluntary sector&#151;who are critical partners&#151;can support families and parents. So, in the Green Paper Every Child Matters and our other work we have set out our objectives to ensure that every child can reach its potential, to build on the progress we have made and identify the main areas for further action to support our children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para135"></a>We know that if family breakdown does occur it can have pervasive ill effects on children as well as having an impact on the wider family. It is a major cause of poverty, as noble Lords have said, inequality, ill health, and social exclusion. The outcomes for children who have experienced disruption and multiple family structures are generally worse than for those who live continuously with a lone parent or a stepfamily. We know that at least one in three children will go through parental separation before the age of 16. We also know that most of them will go through a period of great unhappiness. Many experience low self-esteem, behaviour problems and loss of contact with the extended family.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para136"></a>We also know that children can be helped by good communication with both parents and, fortunately, that both can be enabled to settle back into a normal pattern of development. We also know that there are different approaches to conflict and the extent to which it is resolved; and that those different approaches can have different outcomes for children. We know as well that persistent and intense marital conflict can erode good parenting. It therefore makes sense to help and support couples to promote stability in their relationship. However, the targeting of that support must continue to recognise the choice that couples make about whether they marry.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para137"></a>I was delighted when the Chancellor announced today a 17 per cent increase in the Budget for the Sure Start programme between now and 2008 and I was pleased that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, mentioned that. It is at the heart of our strategy to support families and to give children, particularly those from disadvantaged communities, the best possible start in life. Its principles underpin the Green Paper. The combination of health, family and parenting support with early education and childcare is critical. We have 524 Sure Start programmes that touch the lives of 400,000 children under 4 years old and reach about a third of children living in poverty.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para138"></a>All of those programmes provide an element of parenting support. The nature of that support is determined by local needs&#151;and rightly so. It includes drop-in sessions for families, parenting courses that have proved hugely popular, and specific support for fathers&#151;a point raised by both the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. We intend to build on that commitment by extending family support through our children's centre programme <P>


<a name="column_302"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and through extended schools. Children's centres provide that combination of family, education and health support, accessible in a "one-stop" way, and extended schools enable, in partnership with other services, support for families in a site that is recognised as a place of education and where children can receive those benefits.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para139"></a>We recognise that the importance of that work is in the impact it can have in what happens to our children. Most parents strive to do the best for their children, but how they do that will depend partly on their own experiences. So it is important that we are there to give them that support when they need it. We know how important that is for children's life chances. It is perhaps summed up by Professor De Forges' work, commissioned by my department, which showed that good parenting in the home can make over a 10 per cent difference to children's outcomes at school. So programmes like Sure Start are critical.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para140"></a>Regarding the references to what happens in Sweden, and references by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, to the HomeStart programme, noble Lords will know that we have outlined our intention to roll out nationally home visiting support to one in 50 families. The HomeStart programme particularly enables families with young children to receive that vital support at the beginning&#151;which noble Lords have described as the joy of new parenting, which also brings challenges. The programme enables us to offer support to families who need it. That will be important.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para141"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has not come across parenting classes, but yesterday I received a leaflet from my children's school inviting me as a parent to go to parenting classes if I so wished. Although we are parents of teenagers, I may yet take it up. Having met the noble Lord's beautiful daughter, I suspect that she is teaching him everything he needs to know about parenting.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para142"></a>Both right reverend Prelates, the Bishop of Oxford and the Bishop of Leicester, talked about the voluntary sector and the need to engage other partners in our work. I believe that it is critical that we engage and offer direct support for the voluntary sector. We are establishing a framework to do that more efficiently and to recognise that we also need to facilitate public education, through best practice, in our work with the voluntary sector. Most organisations with which I have had the privilege to work recognise how important it is to work in partnership with us and to offer those special services to families.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para143"></a>In addition to Sure Start, we are providing funding through a number of grant programmes such as Family Support and the Parenting Fund. While we are debating this matter, the families division within the department is looking at the wider funding programme that we need to put in place to ensure greater cohesion and effective rollout of family related funds for the future.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para144"></a>Organisations such as Parentline Plus, Relate, HomeStart, Fathers Direct, 2as1 and the Asian Family Counselling Services work in partnership with <P>


<a name="column_303"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government on evidence-based policy as well as providing family and relationship support services at a national and local level. That is critical to the work that we want to do.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para145"></a>Noble Lords referred to the importance of recognising the issues that concern our lone parents, many of whom are alone not by choice but by circumstance. They need help to enable them to support their families financially through work, where that is the right thing to do; they need support in childcare; and they also need help to enable them to get out of poverty, where so many of them are.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para146"></a>However, we also recognise that children are better in a stable, loving relationship with one parent than in an unhappy, chaotic or possibly violent relationship. That point was made clear by a number of noble Lords. We should not penalise such children and families; we should support them. Under no circumstances should we make any child feel that his relationship is inferior, nor make any parent feel guilty.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para147"></a>Noble Lords raised the issue of fathers, and I have referred to that. It is critical that we engage fathers, particularly at a time when we see families changing and when fathers may not necessarily feel so sure about their role. Again, an important part of the Sure Start programme is engaging fathers.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para148"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about the role of schools and education. I agree with what they said. I am pleased that the noble Lord likes the website and I shall feed back that information. It is important that the curriculum reflects people, and I believe that it does. No doubt we shall engage in further discussions on that topic. I was particularly pleased that the noble Lord referred to mentors and the critical importance of role models. We know that to be very important in many of our schools where we have learning mentors. It is important that some boys have the role model of an adult male, who is perhaps the only role model that they have in their lives.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para149"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Northbourne and Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, talked about taxation. I acknowledge the replacement of the married couples' tax allowance with the child tax credit and the working families' tax credit, which are marriage blind. But the focus of these new tax arrangements is on tackling child poverty. We consider that to be critical, and it is more important than discriminating against children because of the marital status of their parents. As a government, we want to tackle social exclusion across all families. However, there continue to be substantial tax advantages for married couples in capital provisions and in death and inheritance arrangements. Those do not directly benefit children but they are a tangible recognition of the support of the state for married couples.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para150"></a>In conclusion, I want to make a few points on which I believe we all agree. We are all committed to supporting all children and all families, and we share the view that promoting family stability is essential if we are to achieve a better outcome for families and children. I hope that, having heard about some of the <P>


<a name="column_304"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>things that we are undertaking, noble Lords will agree that we are attempting to ensure the provision of better support.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para151"></a>We know that parents and families have a critical influence on a child's life and life chances and that, where children grow up in stable, happy family units, they usually do better in life. We agree that marriage can act as a bedrock for many families but, increasingly today, families take many forms: single-parent families; same-sex families; stepfamilies; and blended families. Children who grow up in all such stable, healthy families, enjoying the love and support of a committed parent or parents, thrive.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para152"></a>We are committed to supporting marriage but we are committed, too, to supporting all parents in building and maintaining stable relationships and a stable family life. We remain committed to saving marriages which can be saved but, where a marriage has irretrievably broken down, we feel that the best way forward is to support parents in establishing a good, ongoing relationship between themselves and their children.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para153"></a>Families are all different, whatever form they take, and their need for support varies, too. By bringing together into one department the different responsibilities for policies relating to services for children and young people and their families and, more importantly, by joining up those services on the ground, we believe that we shall be able to respond more effectively. We recognise the importance of our voluntary sector partners. We remain committed to investing in the voluntary sector, which remains an important and integral partner in our support for families.

<A NAME="40317-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, what a joy it is to have a Minister who can speak with so much enthusiasm and genuine commitment on this issue, and what a joy it is to have a government who have done so much in this area. I believe that I have about two minutes in which to speak. I can see noble Lords who are to take part in the next debate watching me with eagle eyes, but I want briefly to make two points.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para155"></a>First, what has emerged from this debate is that we are talking about all kinds of different things when we talk about committed relationships, stable relationships and quality relationships and, in particular, when we talk about cohabitation. Cohabitation covers a whole spectrum. It may be worthwhile to think a little more carefully and to try to define what is and is not good for children, just as, if I may say, I have done in relation to marriage. If I may make so bold as to correct the noble Baroness, I am not talking about promoting marriage; I am talking about promoting healthy marriage, which is <P>


<a name="column_305"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>different. That is what I should like to see the Government do more of&#151;if that is a legitimate use of the English language.
<P>

<a name="40317-05_para156"></a>This debate is not about a nanny state and it is not about moralising; it is about the nation's future. I thank all noble Lords for their contributions. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.

<P>

<a name="40317-06_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in opening this debate, I declare myself a lifelong supporter of the British public library system and a former chair of Cheshire County Council's libraries' committee. A number of my immediate family work, and have worked, in libraries.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para1"></a>I feel that I was almost brought up in my local library, Bury Knowle Library in Headington, Oxford, and in the old City Central Library in Blue Boar Street. I well remember the day in the 1950s when, as a callow 12 year-old, I received my first ever inter-library loan&#151;a copy of the mammoth A History of Chess by HJR Murray. This exotic volume had come from sunnier climes&#151;well, from Southampton Central Library, to be precise&#151;but, to me, its very arrival betokened an undiscovered world of mystery, romance and learning. I had begun down the path taken years before by Virginia Woolf, of,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40317-06_para3"></a>Many of us must have had that experience when young and, most especially, when the local library represented the major source of books in the family home, as it did to me. Today, public libraries are still held in high esteem by the public, but they are almost wholly ignored by politicians other than as venues for surgeries&#151;a service I prized as a councillor and an MEP. Indeed, I yearn for the day when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition at Prime Minister's Question Time throw the book at each other over the quality and funding of the public library service.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para4"></a>In today's Britain, when improving public services is the current catchword of party politics, our libraries are left largely speechless. Indeed, today's debate in the Lords is the first that we have had on the subject for many years, and in the other place only one such abbreviated debate has taken place in the recent past.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para5"></a>That is more the pity, given that this is the first government in decades to invest new moneys in the libraries, as exemplified by the outstanding People's Network programme of furnishing all our public libraries with on-line facilities and also by the publication <P>


<a name="column_306"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>last year of the ground-breaking A Framework for the Future, which gives new direction to a public service which has survived rather than marched into the 21st century. I very much welcome the contribution that will come from my noble friend Lady Blackstone, who pioneered A Framework for the Future. I hope that today's debate can help the process of raising the profile of Britain's most used and most loved public service.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para6"></a>The Audit Commission's recent report on public libraries highlights some of the stagnation that has silently overtaken our libraries and which A Framework for the Future seeks to address. It points to deficiencies in libraries' traditional roles: book funds have diminished by some 33 per cent over the past 12 years; loans are down 23 per cent and visits by 17 per cent; and the number of libraries that remain open longer than 30 hours a week has declined by 9 per cent. Too many of our current libraries are in old buildings, poorly furbished and often wrongly sited to meet today's mobile populations.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para7"></a>Of course, some of those problems can be resolved by injections of cash into councils' budgets which have seen increases both in central funding and in centrally imposed new responsibilities and targets. A better use of current resources to refocus our libraries on serving current needs can also be beneficial. I give an example. At the moment certain categories of books, like cult and fantasy fiction, gay and lesbian books and 20th century American and world literature are neglected in favour of other, sometimes more traditional categories that are declining in popularity. Likewise, too many libraries fail to buy sufficient copies of regularly issued books through lack of book funds and perhaps through a fear of being accused of dumbing down by concentrating on bestsellers. But surely the customer should be king.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para8"></a>With regard to opening hours, too often they reflect past life and work patterns. Staff should be flexible to the idea that large libraries in the hearts of towns and cities, for instance, should open on a Sunday, now a traditional shopping day, as Wednesday was once early closing day. Sometimes we must take the book to the customer, not the other way round.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para9"></a>In recent years there has been a renaissance in building new libraries of considerable architectural merit and utility. Such new designs get closer to the customer and are attractive both inside and out. But not all is well. My own 1984 Chester City library is an attractive, if small, library of modern design, incorporating the charming older fa&#231;ade of the former Westminster coachworks. I fear that its replacement, as Chester undergoes significant retail redevelopment, will rejoice in modernised facilities, but I regret its loss of a groundfloor window on the world as its main facilities are posted upstairs, out of sight and hence out of mind.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para10"></a>We middle-class users too readily forget that the 30 per cent of our fellow citizens who never use libraries find them all too often in buildings that are both inaccessible and forbidding. I have often wondered too why the insides of our libraries are not more welcoming to the public. Coffee bars can add to <P>


<a name="column_307"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the general welcome, without disturbing the peace, if wisely located; and toilets should be a facility offered, not concealed from the public. Truly, we need our libraries to spend a penny or two on satisfying the customer.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para11"></a>Many staff perform with dedication the pivotal role of linking borrower to the borrowed in a job which is neither well paid nor well regarded, nor replete with opportunities for promotion. Some reform is needed here, too, so that, for instance, a culture of floor-walking by staff can bring their skills closer to the customer, skills, as Charles Medawar describes, which are underestimated and largely underemployed. Commensurately, greater use of self-issue can free librarians from their rubberstamping role to one of active engagement with the borrowers, a plus for both parties.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para12"></a>I also endorse the growing practice of librarian job swaps which help to spread the adoption of best practice. But all this needs greater investment in time and energy to help to propel the library service into the 21st century. I invite my noble friend to suggest how the Government might deploy their admirable philosophy of coupling reform with public investment to achieve those aims.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para13"></a>So far I have concentrated on reinvigorating the traditional role of promoting books and reading, but I would like to touch on other themes of A Framework for the Future, including the People's Network, which, alongside learndirect, helps to promote learning and the expansion of digital citizenship. Indeed, the People's Network, an inspired initiative, for which we must thank my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, illustrates the Government's desire to use the library service to support and to supplement other government and local authority objectives, including the promotion of education and gaining jobs. For those members of the community hitherto excluded, the network has found jobs for some 8,000 people, some 27 per cent of whom have never before used the Internet. But I am unclear about the future funding and expansion of this and other clearly successful initiatives, whose cost-effectiveness must be unparalleled across the gamut of the public services, sponsored by the Government. Perhaps my noble friend will reassure us.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para14"></a>In preparing for this contribution I have been impressed with the arguments for concentrating on the young, indeed sometimes the very young, to break the impoverishing cycle which sees those excluded from the worlds of learning, skills and meaningful employment rearing the next generation, similarly bereft and excluded. That libraries have a unique role here has been revealed by the success of the Bookstart scheme, piloted in Birmingham in the 1990s and unusually supported privately by Sainsbury's supermarket chain. Its efficacy is illustrated not only by its beneficial effect on very young children's preparation for formal school, but also by the fact that their parents, often from target social classes D and E, are themselves drawn into the libraries and hence into the world of learning.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para15"></a>The issue of book packs, through local health visitors, is particularly innovative and successful and illustrates the benefits of joined-up government. It <P>


<a name="column_308"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be helpful to learn from my noble friend what steps are being taken to secure enduring funding for those cheap but cheerful and effective initiatives. Indeed, what other initiatives might be fostered by better liaison with national, but more especially, local businesses? My instinct is that currently, despite some sporadic green shoots of enterprise, the worlds of business and library services are still ships passing in the night.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para16"></a>Similarly that is the case with libraries and the tourism industry. I am one of those sad people who finds libraries tourist attractions. I fondly remember visits to the New York public library and the Harry E Widener library at Harvard. There are practical reasons why tourism and libraries should team up, if only to dispense tourism literature better&#151;but more could be done.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para17"></a>I am told that in Canada libraries encourage tourists to use their e-mail and Internet facilities to stay in touch with home&#151;simple but effective. That leads me to another missed opportunity for our libraries. They advertise everyone else, but themselves. Libraries, so often the notice board of their local community, signally fail to market themselves in the high street. I am heartened by the experiment in Luton whereby local cinemas collude with the library authorities to advertise to the young people streaming through the doors of local cinemas that there is another world of fantasy, fact and fiction down the road: their local library. Our public libraries must be nimble in spotting where they can collaborate with and buttress other public services. Education and tourism are but two examples. The Prison Service is a third, where good dynamic libraries are the touchstone for rehabilitating prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para18"></a>The first door on which to knock is surely that of the wealth of other library providers found in our towns and cities up and down the land. I do not simply mean college and university libraries. What about private libraries and those attached to business and industry? They should also be brought in. Britain should become a mosaic of a single library service, not a maze of separating libraries where high hedges separate treasures that can be shared by us all.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para19"></a>In this respect, I am particularly pleased to learn of the British Library's recent receipt of &#163;2.4 million from the Treasury's "Invest to Save the Budget" scheme, helping the British Library to respond to its yearly 160,000 requests from local libraries. As welcome is its involvement with local libraries in Newcastle, Birmingham and Liverpool to provide specialist material for a touring football exhibition aimed at football fans young and old, whose current reading may be limited to fanzines and football programmes.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para20"></a>In promoting the spread of best practice in modern libraries, we should share experiences with our European neighbours and Commonwealth colleagues. I am not sure whether this is done at anything other than anecdotal level. I understand that in Belgium it is practice to provide post boxes to return borrowed items outside libraries when they are closed. That reminds me of the new Norfolk and Norwich <P>


<a name="column_309"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Millennium Library, which provides in its lobby a fast book service for the borrower in a hurry, again matching the service to the customers' lifestyles.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para21"></a>I would like to put some concluding questions to my noble friend. As this is Budget day, I invite the Minister to suggest to his friend the Chancellor that he make a significant hike in the funding of our public libraries at his next spending review. Spending currently stands at some &#163;800 million. Is it really beyond the wit of the Treasury to round that figure up to &#163;1 billion, given the cost-effectiveness of libraries and their major contribution to other government policies? Will my noble friend also approach the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;which has a slightly confusing relationship with DCMS in respect of responsibilities for libraries&#151;and suggest that it is intolerable to have so wide a variation in local library service spending? Some authorities spend a mere &#163;1 per head of population, and others &#163;2.50, which is two and a half times as much. Is it not time to expand the local authorities' statutory duty to run a library service and to hypothecate a percentage of councils' budgets to their libraries?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para22"></a>Can my noble friend help local councils to do a more effective job in overseeing the library service by establishing an "Oflib", or "Ofbook", tasked to inspect our libraries on a rolling basis? Incidentally, do the Government believe that the 21 standards that they set out four years ago as benchmarks for an improved public library service have been met? I am informed by one local authority that only two of the original 21 can be said to have been fulfilled.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para23"></a>In conclusion, I remind the House that the ancient library at Thebes had inscribed over its portal its role as "the medicine chest of the soul". Our public libraries are far from expiring, but they need some remedial first aid to help them and us to minister to our people in the coming century. I hope that the Government agree. I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="40317-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to my noble friend Lord Harrison for introducing this debate on public libraries. I am only sorry that there are so few speakers in this debate. I know that it is Budget day, but nevertheless public libraries deserve something better than this from your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para24"></a>I am speaking in this debate to reconfirm my strong commitment to sustaining a strong public library system. Public libraries should be at the centre of all of our communities. They must be at the centre of our communities in promoting reading, but there are other things too that they can and should do. I will say more about those later.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para25"></a>As the Minister for the Arts, I was delighted to discover that public libraries were part of my remit. I was proud to have that responsibility for two years. I discovered that they had had far too little attention from government for some time. Perhaps the more glamorous areas in the arts, such as museums, were <P>


<a name="column_310"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taking precedence. Perhaps public libraries had been taken for granted for far too long. Perhaps, as my noble friend Lord Harrison said, expenditure on public libraries is not under the control of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and there is a slightly uncomfortable split responsibility between the DCMS and the ODPM.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para26"></a>Having discovered that they were part of my remit, I then went on a wonderful voyage of discovery through visits to public libraries, including the library in Chester that my noble friend played such a big part in developing back in the 1980s. I went to conferences, and I read about libraries. I then decided that it was sensible to set up a series of seminars in the DCMS, bringing in experts from a variety of different fields to consider the key issues in ensuring that our public library service should be as good as it possibly could be. I am grateful for what my noble friend just said about my part in developing A Framework for the Future, but it really was a team effort. I want to express my gratitude to the many participants in the process, of which those seminars were a key part. What A Framework for the Future tries to do is provide a national vision as to why libraries matter and to set out what they should do. I also wanted to start a debate on how to improve them. I wanted them to have greater visibility, and I wanted to promote their importance, although I do not seem to have had a great deal of effect in the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para27"></a>The general public has an enormously high regard for libraries. Some 60 per cent of the population are members; 90 per cent think that libraries provide a valuable service to local communities; and 90 per cent of 16 to 24 year-olds share that view. This is a very high level of support for a public service, and it is a tribute to the dedication of many of those who work in libraries. In the light of this, one might ask whether anything needs to be done about libraries. My answer is a resounding, "Yes". The library service is not just one service; there are 149 different library services in England, and they are all autonomous, so it is a fragmented service. What is on offer varies greatly, and so do standards in our public library system. There are a great deal of gains from that autonomy and variety. It allows for innovation; it allows different means of delivery in different kinds of communities. However, there are also benefits from shared aspirations and high standards across authorities rather than huge disparities from place to place in the benefits that public libraries provide.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para28"></a>Moreover, the ways in which libraries are being used have changed, and we must take this into account. Libraries must be aware of this, and they must adjust to it. Between 1992 and 2002, library visits dropped by 17 per cent, and book loans dropped by the remarkable figure of one quarter, which is a cause for concern. Library book issues went down, whereas book sales went up. That need not in any way spell the demise of public libraries&#151;certainly not. As my noble friend has already said, libraries are not just about book loans, although that will always be an important function of libraries. We must provide books that people want to read, and we must do so in a cost-effective way that reflects contemporary needs. To <P>


<a name="column_311"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>give an example, renewals should be possible through a 24-hour telephone service. It should not be necessary for people to carry large bags of books back to the library to renew them.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para29"></a>Libraries are about other things than supporting reading for pleasure, which is the greatest of all pleasures in my view, for at least many people. They are about providing information, and they are a repository of information of all kinds. In the digital age, no public library should be unable to help people to find the information that they need. As my noble friend has already mentioned, one of the valuable services that the British Library provides to the public library system is the supply of documents remotely. This is being modernised by a Treasury grant, as my noble friend said. That certainly enhances the information services that libraries can provide. A very important part of the job of public libraries is to enhance learning and support the work of schools and colleges.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para30"></a>Anybody who has been into a children's library on a day when there are a couple of primary school classes there cannot but help to find that an enjoyable experience. Every primary school should be instilling in children the habit of reading. Every primary school should regularly be taking its classes into children's libraries. I am afraid that is not always the case. Similarly, every secondary school should be encouraging its pupils to use their local libraries for project work, which is true for FE colleges, too. Even before school begins, toddlers should, wherever they live, be in reach of a public library for story-telling sessions and benefit from services such as toy libraries, which I have seen in a number of public libraries but not in all of them. What discussions has my noble friend the Minister had with the DfES and his colleagues there to promote more effectively schools' use of public libraries?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para31"></a>Of course, learning in libraries is not just about young people. It is also about life-long learning. One of the recent success stories, as my noble friend mentioned, has been the People's Network, and the lottery grant which was provided to link up all libraries to the web has been immensely successful. That has been achieved. Associated with that are exciting programmes for IT training in libraries for adults, especially for elderly people, sometimes in partnership with learndirect. Again I have a couple of questions I want to put to my noble friend the Minister. I do not know whether any data have been collected on how far links with learndirect are leading to expanded provision in public libraries for people to acquire basic skills. Libraries, of course, can and should be helping the Government to reach their overall goal of Internet access for everyone.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para32"></a>My second question concerns the end of the NOF money and builds on what my noble friend has already asked. It has been said that the library service will run into difficulties in sustaining free Internet-connected services once that money dries up. I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister thinks that is a legitimate worry, and if so what plans the Government have to intervene.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para33"></a>As well as promoting learning, public libraries have a very important role in promoting social cohesion and a sense of pride in a local community. It is one of the few <P>


<a name="column_312"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>free community spaces still available. Anyone can go into a library; they can come off the street and benefit from what libraries have to offer. That space should be used imaginatively. It ought to be available for art exhibitions by local members of the community; for the work of young people in secondary schools or FE colleges who have taken part in a poetry competition&#151;their poems should be up on the walls. There are many other ways in which we can use space in our local libraries. Perhaps it is relevant to say on Budget day that one library I visited had invited the Inland Revenue to come in and provide regular sessions for people who needed advice on how to fill in their tax forms. A little bit of that could be extended to other advisory services and perhaps across the country in other library services. Some libraries provide music clubs for young people. I could go on: there are so many uses for this space in buildings which should be used to their maximum by the local community.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para34"></a>One of the most pressing tasks for libraries is to reach out to those who do not use them, such as people who are likely to be socially excluded from many other areas of life. That requires libraries to undertake good outreach work, particularly in deprived inner city neighbourhoods&#151;libraries should go into housing estates&#151;but also in cut-off rural areas, or go to those who are in residential care or to people who are housebound.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para35"></a>Making libraries welcoming, warm and attractive places is important, as is ensuring that they are open at times that people want to use them. That means that they have to be open at the weekends, on both Saturdays and Sundays. But good buildings that are in the right place and which are easily accessible are enormously important. If your library building is run down, depressing and in an area hard to reach by public transport, that does not help to make it accessible to the maximum number of people. There are many new libraries in beautiful buildings, such as Norwich, Bournemouth and Peckham&#151;just a few examples of libraries that have a great buzz about them.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para36"></a>Anyone who says that one cannot make inroads in encouraging more people to use libraries should look at what has happened at Tower Hamlets. That authority found that only 15 per cent of its residents were regular users. By taking the initiative to develop what it called idea stores, and turning around 100 year-old libraries&#151;refurbishing them, making them cheerful and providing cafes and opportunities to use the web&#151;they have had a trebling in their use. Issues of books are up by over 60 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para37"></a>Much of that is set out in Framework for the Future, but that was not an action plan&#151;it was a vision of what public libraries should be like. In order to help make this vision a reality, we appointed a new advisory council on libraries. What advice has that group provided my noble friend with so far and what action has he been able to take as a result? Clearly there is an important role for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in funding local authorities adequately. Also important are the decisions made by local authorities on how to spend the funding they receive. Will the Minister reassure us that the reduced weighting of <P>


<a name="column_313"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>libraries as an indicator for CPAs will not be allowed to result in a lower priority for public libraries in local authorities? Has he yet been able to use his persuasive powers to talk to local authority chief executives and leaders? If he has not yet, I hope he will do so soon.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para38"></a>The other important issue is how to drive up standards across the public library service. Our best libraries are superb; our worst are pretty miserable places. At one time I thought that inspection was the answer, but on reflection I think that is too heavy handed and too costly; local government is already over-regulated and over-inspected. Has the Minister been able to develop a scheme to get the best authorities to work with weaker library authorities in their own region? Can he tell us whether any funding might be made available to bring this about? I am sure that he would agree that that approach ought to be developed.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para39"></a>When we published A Framework for the Future we agreed that annual library plans were over-complex, over-demanding and encouraged a tick-box mentality. We decided that much simpler public library position statements should be asked for instead. These position statements have now been analysed and I hope that my noble friend will say something about what he draws from them and what action is required following this analysis.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para40"></a>I end by saying that free public libraries were invented in the 19th century. They flourished in most of the 20th century, but there has been some under-investment and lack of a public profile for them in the 1980s and 1990s. That has meant that there is a danger that they might start to decline and end up on a downward slope that would be hard to climb up again. In the 21st century, libraries must reinvent themselves to meet the expectations of a different era to the time of Andrew Carnegie. They need political and financial support, but, above all, they need energy, drive and inventiveness from those who run them and work in them. We must recruit the best people to do the job. If that is done and a framework is established that will reward excellence and reinvigorate the dull and the mediocre with good leadership where it counts, our public library system can be the envy of the world.

Nevertheless, the noble Lord has had the good fortune to hear from one of the greatest experts on the matter, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. I have the honour and rather fearful duty of following the noble Baroness in the debate. She has covered many of the points.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para41"></a>It has always been my view&#151;shared, I think, by many in the House&#151;that the library system, in common with our museum and gallery service, must either modernise or die. Both are going about the <P>


<a name="column_314"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>business of trying to modernise. The library system has been more successful than any of us could have hoped. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, that we owe a lot to the fact that, in the short time for which she was Minister, we had in the noble Baroness a fervent supporter of literature and reading. If she will forgive me, I will pick out a few words from her launch of A Framework for the Future. She said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Great literature is, without question, our country's greatest gift to the world's cultural heritage, and libraries are the means by which we share and celebrate it. Reading is essential to modern life, and a major source of pleasure for millions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para42"></a>
How right she was. How right that must now seem to a larger number of people than when she said it.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para43"></a>We have had some very good initiatives. The modernisation that is taking place includes the huge success of the People's Network. There are now 32,000 terminals in libraries throughout the country, funded by the New Opportunities Fund, which I am glad to have the opportunity of praising. There have been other initiatives, not least BBC2's recent initiative, "The Big Read". One might be sniffy about attempts of that kind to promote cultural activities, but it was enormously successful. The list of books to which the public attached some importance was somewhat limited, but, nevertheless, the programme attracted a great deal of enthusiasm and provoked a great deal of interest among the public at large in buying books again, particularly backlist literature. As your Lordships know, backlist literature is always vulnerable to the increasingly competitive world of publishing, where the sharpened focus on new titles means that it is always competing with backlist literature. Forty per cent of the fiction market has, in recent years, been backlist literature, but it is a tough battle.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para44"></a>It is not surprising that the lists that young people create of their preferred reading are limited to quite recent works. I was fortunate enough&#151;and unfortunate, I suppose&#151;to have a fairly peripatetic early childhood because of the war and because I was an only child. I spent a lot of time on my own. The other day, my noble friend Lord Thomson of Monifieth, who was giving a talk at a birthday party in the Cholmondeley Room, mentioned a book of which, he said, no one would have heard. I had a slight flush of pleasure when I realised that it was, in fact, a book that had set me off reading seriously at the age of seven: WW Jacobs's collection of sea stories, Many Cargoes. I was so enthusiastic about that book, although my noble friend was right to say that it was now completely unfashionable. I do not think that young readers are likely to have heard of WW Jacobs. However, initiatives such as "The Big Read" will encourage such interest.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para45"></a>Reading, of course, is for pleasure, in the sense in which I understood the noble Baroness's remarks in the introduction to A Framework for the Future. It is so important that people should read for pleasure, not least because they can talk about it afterwards with their friends. For a while, television took over from reading, and we all disliked its effect on reading. Now, television has reversed the situation and actually encourages people to read. There is now less of a gap <P>


<a name="column_315"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between the world of reading for pleasure and watching television. When we come to consider the charter of the BBC and its role as a public service broadcaster, the BBC's role as a supporter of reading and literature will be an important part of the debates that will take place in your Lordships' House and in the other place.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para46"></a>I mentioned my peripatetic childhood. I went on to read all kinds of authors who did not figure in the lists produced after "The Big Read". Perhaps, I will be permitted the luxury of mentioning one or two. Graham Greene is, of course, still on the main lists. He is an important author for all kinds of reasons, not least because his work creates a great deal of discussion. George Orwell is still on the main lists. Aldous Huxley and DH Lawrence, who used to be seen as writers for people going through their adolescence, have almost disappeared. Others whom I like, such as Forster and others, are still there but are, seemingly, rather dated to the younger generation. The women authors that I liked when I was at school&#151;Pamela Hansford Johnson, Pamela Frankau, Rosamund Lehmann and others&#151;seem to have disappeared completely, although a very good biography of Rosamund Lehmann was published recently, and I recommend it to others. It is rather like a book group now; one indulges oneself in telling fellow members of the group what one likes. I would not like to leave the Chamber without mentioning a minor master, Patrick Hamilton, who wrote just after the war. His psychological novels based in seedy Brighton and London were minor masterpieces, if not major masterpieces. He has disappeared to some extent, and his plays&#151;Rope and Gaslight&#151;are not often seen, because of the disappearance of the repertory companies.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para47"></a>Happy to have got that off the page to your Lordships, I must say that it is important for libraries to introduce people to translations. Introducing readers to translated authors such as Chekhov or Tolstoy or to French authors, who are somewhat different and can be difficult to translate, encourages the learning of languages and interest in other cultures. That is an important function of libraries.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para48"></a>I am a little dismayed by the figures that were quoted. The noble Baroness quoted some figures. It is dismaying that recent statistics that I have seen show that only 9.6 per cent of the amount spent by libraries is spent on new books. There may be a good reason for that, and the Minister may be able to cheer me up on that point. It may not be such a significantly low figure as I take it to be.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para49"></a>The modern side of making computers and IT technology available to people is very important. But such technology is quite expensive and the certainty of core funding is, of course, always important. There is always a doubt about that in all areas of the arts. The continuity of core funding and the reassurance that it gives is absolutely vital. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to say a few words about that.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para50"></a>Children are taking to books now. I am very encouraged. I have an 11 year-old who has become an avid reader thanks to JK Rowling and Anthony Horowitz, two of the leading children's writers. He has <P>


<a name="column_316"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>become, thanks to computers, a dedicated writer as well. I do not know where he gets this from. I am far too lazy to do that, although I have always been interested in writing. He also illustrates them, so there must be something right going on in the world which prompts children to take these kinds of steps forward.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para51"></a>Broadcasting and literature are now much closer friends and I am hoping that this impetus will continue. I do not know whether noble Lords are aware of it but, for what I think is the first time ever, there is an All-Party Book Group, which is very encouraging. I went to its inaugural meeting and it was very interesting. I am pleased to see the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who is the inspirer of that book group, on the Benches behind me. I thought that was a wonderful initiative. I was told by a very prominent member the next day, "You must be careful about book groups. You will find that inevitably the majority of regular attendees will be women. They will like to talk about books, in particular about their frustrated ambitions to be writers". I said "Oh no, no! That won't happen in the Houses of Parliament". We shall see, but I am quite sure the noble Baroness will give us a programme which will be varied and stimulating, and navel-gazing will be kept to a minimum. On the first meeting of her group there was such enthusiasm among the small group that I would encourage other noble Lords, who may not be aware of it, to attend regularly.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para52"></a>That is all I have to say, except that I would select one quotation from the reactions to A Framework for the future, which I think hit the nail on the head. It is an extract from the remarks of the Poet Laureate, when he said that libraries,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are vital to the intellectual health of the nation, and as such, should be properly funded, developed and cherished".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para53"></a>
I hope the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, will give us some hope that that will the case.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_time3"></a><H5>6.13 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   My Lords, I very much welcome this debate and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, on giving us the opportunity to assess the impact of this DCMS publication, Framework for the future. As noble Lords know, this report was actually published over a year ago. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said that there had not been any debates about libraries since then, but in fact there was a debate about facilities in public libraries for those who have difficulties accessing books last June. I shall come to that in a minute.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para54"></a>There has also been the publication, yesterday, of library statistics since the last annual appraisal on 20 February 2003. These statistics show, once again, that this Government's keenness about targets really does not work. For instance, out of the 18 public library standards targets set by DCMS, only two were met by all libraries across the country. These statistics also show that, far from increasing library usage, the number of people visiting libraries seems to have been decreasing since the standards were introduced.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para55"></a>What is the reason for this rather depressing situation? Like the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, I certainly do not believe that the library system is <P>


<a name="column_317"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 317</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about to collapse. I wonder, however, whether opening hours do not suit as many people returning from work as they might? Or is it that libraries do not carry enough of the kind of facilities, which have been mentioned by several noble Lords, that the general public are now looking for?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para56"></a>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has a statutory responsibility to promote the development of the public library service under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, and to ensure that local authorities provide a
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"comprehensive and efficient"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para57"></a>
library service. The public library service is administered by local authorities and funded through what was once the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Would the Minister tell me why it is that the public library service is the responsibility of the DCMS, but it appears that the funding of the service is the responsibility of a different department? Is this not illogical?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para58"></a>When the new public library standards were issued in April 2001, it was stated that these standards would be reviewed from time to time, partly to ensure that the administrative burden placed on local authorities required to achieve these standards does not become disproportionate. As I have already said, it appears that these standards are not working. Is this because the administrative burden is, perhaps, excessive?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para59"></a>The DCMS publish an appraisal of the annual library plan, as submitted by each library authority, every year. This appraisal forms a key planning tool, and facilitates the assessment of each authority's performance against locally set standards and targets. Would the Minster explain why an annual appraisal has now been substituted by a Public Libraries Position Statement? Perhaps he could also explain to me, because I do not understand it, the reference to a "post steering group discussion" on 26 January this year.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para60"></a>I notice that the 2003 DCMS appraisal of annual library plans clearly states that it is unlikely that the targets will be met by the authorities in March 2004 as planned. Thus the performance of public libraries will fall beneath standards set by the Government. This appraisal, published in February 2003 and now updated by the position statement, details a number of strategic failures. For example, the first DCMS objective was to ensure that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"library authorities must enable convenient and suitable access for users of libraries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para61"></a>
This target has not been met. We want the potential in all our public libraries to be utilised, to ensure that everyone has access to resources, knowledge and information&#151;particularly the groups in society that would otherwise be disadvantaged by not being able to do this. Again in February 2003, the report A Framework for the future was published, and it offered,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a long-term strategic vision for the public library service".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para62"></a><P>


<a name="column_318"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
In the report, based on the extensive consultation and research with the MLA&#151;previously Resource&#151;the Government states that they are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"committed to public libraries and all that they stand for. Our strategy for their future makes promoting reading their key priority. Libraries also have&#151;and will continue to have&#151;a central role in helping people from all walks of life to be part of the communications revolution sweeping the world".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para63"></a>
The Government press release on the day of the report's publication stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The launch of Framework for the Future is the beginning of the action phase. The Culture Department, together with Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries, and a newly-constituted Advisory Council on Libraries, will work with leaders from local government, libraries and education services to make this vision a reality".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para64"></a>
In May 2002, the Audit Commission published a report entitled Building Better Library Services, which concluded that local libraries focused on current users, rather than on attracting new users. We welcome the new initiatives and ways of encouraging new users, such as offering limited free Internet access in libraries. It is self-evident that libraries need to renew and communicate their purposes to the communities they serve.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para65"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, we welcome the development of new libraries, such as the new Central Library in Bournemouth, pictured in the report. This new library is in the central part of the town and maintains excellent transport links, with the bus terminal positioned directly outside the building, in addition to a multi-storey car park. The old library in Bournemouth, which was built in 1913, was on the outskirts of the main town centre. The new library, built very recently, has 45,000 more books and over 50 computers available free for an hour's Internet use. It even has toilets and baby-changing facilities, something which your Lordships' House does not have and which the old building in Bournemouth lacked as well. The surroundings are very pleasant and offer open-plan reading tables, an easy reference system and well trained staff in a modern and accessible environment.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para66"></a>This new library is always busy and has become a focal point for the town, highlighting how such a facility can considerably improve social cohesion while making valuable resources available to all members of the community. The library hosts events to raise public awareness of national initiatives such as the Big Read and the Orange Prize. In addition to the numerous books stocked, the library boasts a collection of spoken word CDs and cassettes, which are available free of charge to those who are visually impaired. Initiatives such as this should be warmly welcomed. However, I am afraid it seems that Bournemouth library, however worthy, is unfortunately not the norm.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para67"></a>I now return to the debate on 8 May 2003 when Her Majesty's Government were asked:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"what measures are being taken to remove all barriers to literature for those who have difficulties accessing books in traditional print formats".&#151;[Official Report, 8/5/03; col. 1295.]

<a name="column_319"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 319</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para69"></a>In that debate, I referred to the report Framework for the Future, the subject of this debate. In the report, the Government argue passionately&#151;and rightly&#151;for the importance of reading and access to literature. While detailing a number of ways in which problems of illiteracy and increasing skills can be addressed, there is no mention of any strategy to assist the blind or visually impaired. With today's increased technology, would it not be appropriate for the Government to consider addressing the issues that the visually impaired face by setting targets for public libraries to carry a selection of audio books which meet the demands of the general public?
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para70"></a>It has been established that audio books are by far the most popular method by which visually impaired people can access literature. The drawback, as is so often the case, is the cost. Has there been any progress since the debate on 8 May? In that debate, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, said, when referring to VAT on audio books:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I hope that I can give a slightly more positive response this year"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para71"></a>
that was last May&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"although I cannot promise to solve all the problems of British taxation in regard to the European Community".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para72"></a>
He went on,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am able to say this evening that the Government will engage in the negotiations positively, with a view to getting the rate of VAT down on audio tapes of books"".&#151;[Official Report, 8/5/03; cols. 1309&#150;10.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para73"></a>
I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on that.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para74"></a>This has been a most interesting debate. I think we are all trying our best to improve the services offered by public libraries, as they are an ever more vital part of community cohesion and education. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response. After that, perhaps we could all retire to our splendid Library here and carry on the debate.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, we are all grateful to my noble friend Lord Harrison for introducing this debate. He is right that the subject deserve more attention in your Lordships' House. It is sad, as he said, that so few people have been inspired to take part in the debate. However, we have made up in quality what we lacked in quantity.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para75"></a>I was particularly pleased to have the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Luke. I looked back at the passage of the Public Libraries Act 1850, the first Act to establish public libraries in this country. It was promoted by a Liberal MP, William Ewart, and attacked by the Conservative Party on the grounds that, as one Conservative MP said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"people have too much knowledge already: it was much easier to manage them twenty years ago; the more education people get the more difficult they are to manage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-06_para76"></a>
I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Luke, does not echo those sentiments.
<P>


<a name="column_320"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para77"></a>It is true, we have to admit, that libraries face a great deal of competition for people's leisure time. It is hardly surprising that if people are watching, on average, four hours of television a day, there is less reading of books. In addition, purchasing books is relatively cheap in relation to disposable income than was the case many years ago. Therefore, a lot more books are actually being bought. It really does not matter, from the point of view of our aesthetic and intellectual objectives, whether the books are bought or borrowed as long as people are reading. I think it is a triumph that people are reading as much as they are. But the effect on public libraries cannot be denied.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para78"></a>It is true, as my noble friend Lord Harrison said, that visits to public libraries have been going down, as have book loans, although there is some indication that the number of visits to public libraries, perhaps because of the wider range of services now provided, has bottomed out and is increasing slightly. The MLA figures show that there could have been an increase of 2 to 3 per cent of visits to libraries in 2002&#150;03, and I find that encouraging.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para79"></a>It is also true that declining use of libraries and declining book loans are accompanied by declining funding, because it is thought by local authorities that this is a less important service. But they are profoundly wrong, because of course, despite the decline there has been, as my noble friend Lady Blackstone said, 60 per cent of people in this country are members of a public library. There are more visits to public libraries than there are to professional football matches or to the cinema. As far as the customers are concerned&#151;the users, the readers, although it is more than readers, as I shall show&#151;libraries are one of the most important services that local authorities provide. There are 4,600 public libraries in this country, a lending stock of 84 million books and 32,000 public access computers with access to the Internet. That is quite a service.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para80"></a>It is right that I should say a word about the contribution that libraries make to the priorities of central and local government. Of course they are justified in their own right; of course they are justified on their basic service. But, in addition, they play a very important role, and I shall be responding to the questions of my noble friend Lady Blackstone in a minute. They raise standards in our schools, they provide books for babies, they encourage family reading, reader development schemes and homework clubs and they provide help for lifelong learning. They improve the quality of life for older people&#151;after all, libraries are a safe, warm, community space in which people can meet. This is particularly valuable for older people. I have heard bingo clubs described in the same terms, but I rather think that libraries provide a little more than they do. Libraries provide help in terms of the economic health of the communities. If they provide, as they do, adult basic skills, business information for small and medium-sized companies, then they are an economic resource for this country. If I am asked to say the right words to Gordon Brown then, yes, those are the words that I would use. I think that there is a very significant economic benefit.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para81"></a>I was very pleased to hear the welcome for the People's Network, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. It has been a remarkable achievement, not just to get the lottery funding in the first place but to get it on the ground and to get it working in nearly every one of this country's public libraries. If you extrapolated from a survey of 30 library authorities, you would find that, nationwide, nearly 24,000 people had started a formal education course; over 62,000 people report gaining a new skill; over 105,000 IT training sessions were run in public libraries; and 7,000 people have found new jobs.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para82"></a>There is an issue about sustainability, because you put in computers and train staff but they become obsolete in a period of years. Part of the bid to receive NOF funds for the People's Network, however, was that local authorities were obliged to submit plans, illustrating how they would continue to fund their People's Network centres once the NOF funding ceased. I have confidence that local authorities are aware of that obligation. I am also conscious that it probably will not work everywhere and that we shall have to find some additional funding from somewhere, in order to make sure that it continues.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para83"></a>Let me now turn to the A Framework for the future, which is referred to on the Order Paper and, as has been recognised, is the brainchild of my noble friend Lady Blackstone as a most distinguished Minister with responsibility for libraries. The basis of A Framework for the future was that, although there were plenty of examples of good practice in libraries&#151;and some of them have been given by speakers today&#151;and plenty of examples of local authorities providing modern, high-quality libraries and understanding their potential, there were also plenty of examples of local authorities who do not. That was why A Framework for the future was published: to provide a 10-year strategic vision; to encourage greater innovation and greater efficiency in the library service; to promote books, reading and learning; to encourage access to the digital age; and to develop community and civic values.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para84"></a>It was not just a publication in its own right, however. What happened immediately afterwards was that my noble friend Lady Blackstone commissioned the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council to prepare a three-year plan of activity to turn that vision into reality. That action plan was published in September last year at the Public Libraries Association conference in Torquay, at which I spoke. It is funded with &#163;3 million over a period of three years. There is a long list of targets, and achievements towards those targets, in the action plan and in our reports on that plan. I will return in a moment to the point made about targets by the noble Lord, Lord Luke.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para85"></a>As has been said, one of the purposes is a sort of glorified self-help. If we have a library service which is widely varied in quality, it is enormously important that we should have the best helping the less good. Therefore, with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, we are setting up help teams, using the Improvement and Development Agency and the Office of the Deputy <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Prime Minister peer review system. These teams are already in training and starting to be in operation. They will bring together library leaders and staff to work with individual authorities, to help them to improve their libraries. We will be seconding mentors to libraries and encouraging pairing-up with other libraries. We have a leadership programme for about 450 library staff, developed with the Society of Chief Librarians and with the MLA.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para86"></a>Valid points were made, in particular by my noble friend Lord Harrison, about the marketing of libraries. I heard my learned friend Lady Blackstone praising Tower Hamlets' Idea Stores. She is quite right. I too have been there, and what is being done is terrific. Hampshire is proposing to re-brand its libraries as "Discovery Centres". I rather like the word "libraries". I like Peckham's wonderful new library, which has the word "library", about 100 feet long, on the roof. I would rather stick to that brand, which I think is an enormously important one and describes what it is. I believe that we can build on it, to extend the range of services that a library provides without losing the essential element behind it. It is certainly true, however, that we do need to market our libraries substantially better.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para87"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, referred to the fact that the expenditure on books is only 9.6 per cent of total library budgets. It is also true that, as there is a decline, there is the horrible tendency that more money goes on administration and less on frontline services. That happens everywhere. We have to do something about that. The Advisory Council for Libraries, which my noble friend Lady Blackstone revived and which I have been using intensively, is very concerned on that point. I am not convinced that we are getting the right deals out of publishers and booksellers on books, using our purchasing power. I am certainly not convinced that we are doing the most economical thing. There is one study which shows that it costs as much to purchase and to index a book as it does to buy a book. That cannot be right. We have to find some way round that, and indeed we are actively doing so.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para88"></a>Even though there has not been too much reference to it this evening, I want to refer to learning initiatives. One of the main things that libraries can do to make a real difference to people's quality of life is the promotion of reading and informal learning, and indeed of formal learning. A Framework for the Future identified five learning offers which libraries will make to the community and which will be marketed as national activities. Those are: early years services, to which reference was made by my noble friend Lord Harrison, namely Bookstart, book bags, and encouraging parents to share books with children from an early age; learning for young people, which involves the Positive Activities for Young People programme for the vulnerable eight to 19-year-olds, and to steer them towards reading. That is the work of the Reading Agency, which is particularly concerned with literacy targets and opening up the world of the creative imagination to people whose homes, I am afraid, are book-free zones.

<a name="40317-06_para89"></a>My noble friend Lady Blackstone referred to this as out-of-school learning and referred in particular to project work. She asked whether we were having discussions with the Department for Education and Skills about collaboration in this area, and I can assure her that we certainly are. The Secretary of State for the DCMS, Tessa Jowell, is working with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Charles Clarke, to encourage visits by schools to museums and libraries. Of course that is part of it, as is also the availability of libraries for out-of-school learning.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para90"></a>I am a member of the Cabinet Committee on Adult Basic Skills, and the chairman, Charles Clarke, referred to the locations for adult learning. He of course mentioned universities and colleges and also, quite rightly, the National Health Service and prison populations&#151;where there are quite a lot of people who need adult basic skills. I piped up and said, "Libraries as well", and he immediately added it to his list, because clearly these are obvious places for adult learning.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para91"></a>I discovered to my astonishment that we do not know what libraries can contribute to adult learning. If I was asked, "What facilities are there? How many libraries have room for individual learning workstations as they do for ICT work stations, or room for study circles or seminars and so on?", I find it shaming to say that I do not know the answers to those obvious questions So I am setting in train a survey which will make sure that I do know the answers. When DfES comes to me and says it wants to use the libraries for e-learning, or when Ofcom comes to me and says it wants to use libraries for media literacy, I will be able to give answers on what we can provide.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para92"></a>That leads me on to the issue of adult learning. I can assure my noble friend Lady Blackstone that the links we have with learndirect are absolutely critical. Ann Limb, its chief executive, is very conscious of the contribution that libraries can and indeed do make. These are not projections for the future.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para93"></a>Inevitably there has been talk about funding. My noble friend Lord Harrison wants me to appeal to Gordon Brown for more money. The difficulty is that, as everyone knows, libraries are funded as part of local authority block grants. There is no ring fencing for libraries. If local authorities are either poor or mean&#151;in my experience all local authorities are either poor or mean and sometimes both&#151;there is no way that we in DCMS, who have the responsibility for library standards, can ensure that any given amount of funding will be allocated to libraries.
<P>

<a name="40317-06_para94"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, wants the certainty of core funding. Of course we want it too, but we do not have it. The way to get an improvement in library standards is not with sticks, because we do not have any sticks, but with carrots.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   My Lords, it was in respect of targets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, targets and standards are two approaches to the same thing. The noble Lord must know that for 150 years local authorities have had responsibility for setting their own budgets, including libraries. For the first part of those 150 years, under Conservative governments, there were restrictions on the amount of money that could be spent on libraries&#151;a halfpenny rate comes to mind. More progressive governments have moved ahead, but we have not yet said that central government will prescribe how much local authorities will spend on libraries. I do not believe that we should. I recognise the difficulties that it involves.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para0"></a>We find ourselves in the position of having responsibility in DCMS for standards in libraries but without the means to carry them out. What are we going to do about it? I have hinted at the answer already, in the sense that we have been establishing standards or targets&#151;whichever one wishes to say. We have not achieved 100 per cent compliance with all those standards. We set an ambitious target of the end this month. In almost all these areas we are seeing improvements in the quality of services according to our own standards and targets.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para1"></a>The Advisory Council on Libraries has been simplifying the targets with position statements. We have simplified them by excluding those that are no longer necessary because they are being 100 per cent achieved. So I think that it will be accepted that we are doing the right thing. My noble friend Lady Blackstone asked me about how the advisory council works. It has set its own agenda in those ways. I have set it additional targets for e-learning and for the sustainability of the People's Network. In general, we have a lot of pressure, a lot of collaboration between library services and a lot of things that we can do from the centre, in terms of help rather than force, to improve the library standards to such a level that we can all be proud of them. As we receive future reports on the progress towards the achievements set out as being possible in A Framework for the future, I hope that that it will be seen that we are making that progress.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para2"></a>I have not answered the question of the noble Lord, Lord Luke, on disability. I visited the National Library for the Blind. I agree with him entirely about the value of the services that it provides. I wish I had a positive answer on VAT, but, as he knows, negotiations for VAT last autumn did not come to anything. Therefore, the cautious response of my noble friend Lord Davies was rightly cautious.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para3"></a>I say again that I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. I repeat my thanks to my noble friend Lord Harrison for introducing it. I am glad to have had the opportunity to respond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   My Lords, I hope and believe that tonight's debate has furthered the cause of better <P>


<a name="column_325"></a>

</P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understanding of public libraries. I too would like to thank all noble Lords who have contributed. As the Minister said, we may be few in number but I think the quality was extremely high.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para4"></a>I would like to take up the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Luke, of retiring to our own Library for further discussion, but I fear that we might disturb some of our colleagues who might otherwise like the silence there. The noble Lord prompts me to thank all those who work in our own Library, and especially those at the research desk who have contributed yet again to the background material I have used tonight.

<a name="40317-07_para7"></a>Clause 8 [Auditors' rights to information]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 31:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 11, after "explanations" insert "(in written form where so requested)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-07_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40317-07_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: We move now to Chapter 2, which takes us from the structure of the accounting profession, and Mr Masson's brilliant charts, to accounts and reports. Amendment No. 31 relates to auditors' rights to information and concerns the manner in which statements are to be taken by auditors. It states that an auditor may require information or explanations in written form by inserting the words in the amendment after the word "explanations".
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para10"></a>Under current law, as I understand it, auditors have the right to demand explanations in writing but it is not clear whether that is the case in the Bill. That is why we have tabled the amendment. The value of the provision is self-evident. If director A makes a comment to the auditor which the auditor considers important, the auditor should be empowered to require that the statement be put in writing. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  Clause 8 contains important provisions on the right of auditors to obtain information. These derive mostly from existing law but with the significant change that those required to provide information and explanations to the auditor include employees for the first time. That change reflects clear recommendations from both the Company Law Review Group and the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para11"></a>Auditors should be able to ask for information and expect truthful answers from as many as possible of those likely to have information necessary for the successful performance of the audit. The amendment would specifically enable the auditors to require information and explanations to be given in writing. We do not think that this is necessary. The auditor's right under this clause, as under the existing provision, is to such information and explanations as he thinks necessary for the performance of his duty as an auditor.
<P>


<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para12"></a>As far as we are aware, there has been no difficulty because auditors cannot specifically require explanations in writing. If an auditor is dissatisfied with oral information&#151;perhaps because the subject matter is highly complicated&#151;it will be possible for him to say that he has not had the necessary information for the performance of his duties and to ask for the information in writing.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para13"></a>The noble Lord may see this change as linked to his further proposal, which we shall reach at Amendment No. 44, to restrict the offence of providing a misleading, false or deceptive statement or explanation to an auditor only where it is written. If the amendment is seen as a way of addressing the gap opened up by his Amendment No. 44, I do not think that that is a good enough reason for this amendment. Giving the auditor the right to require a person to provide the information or explanation in writing does not change our view about the desirability of that amendment, to which we will come later.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para14"></a>So, in simple terms, we do not think that this is necessary. The auditor would be able to get a written statement if he so wished.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I can reassure the Minister that Amendment No. 44 stands alone. This amendment is not linked to it in any way.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para15"></a>Our advice is that existing law provides for an explanation to be given in writing. The Minister may say that that does not matter but, of course, his officials have argued strenuously that changes elsewhere in the Bill which drop provisions&#151;this happened in regard to vouchers yesterday&#151;indicate that Parliament's will might be altering. If it stated "written" before but does not state "written" now&#151;which is probably a matter of fact that his officials can confirm&#151;why does not this provision indicate that Parliament's will is changing on this matter? If "written" is to be dropped, surely the courts will interpret that accordingly. Does the Minister wish to comment on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Yes, I do. I do not think that anything I said should imply that we are changing here. There is not a requirement for information to be written now and we are not proposing a change to that. The noble Lord seems to suggest that a barnacle should be added to the ship, rather than taking one away.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. If the provision is not in existing law&#151;our legal briefings suggested that it was and that therefore there would be a reduction or a weakness&#151;and as I do not know the detail, I shall obviously take further advice. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para16"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 32:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, leave out line 14 and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-07_para17"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(a) any officer of the company or those employees of the company engaged in the preparation of the company's accounts;"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40317-07_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: We are still on the same clause. We now come to consider the position of employees for the first time, to which the Minister referred in his reply to Amendment No. 31. Amendment No. 32, which is grouped with Amendment No. 76, would limit the people who must provide information to the auditors not just to officers or employees of the company, but also to those who are engaged in the preparation of the company's accounts. Therefore, the amendment would confine the auditors' source of information to those who are engaged in preparing the company's accounts.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para19"></a>By this and the next group of amendments, we wish to probe the Government's thinking on the position of employees. Although it seems unjust to put every employee in the firing line, we recognise the force of the argument that it is more reasonable to permit the auditor's inquiries to include those involved in preparing the company's accounts, because the verification of the accounts is the auditor's key role. The law should give the auditor access to information relevant to his task. If the auditor asks to look over all information stemming from every possible source within the company, however unrelated it might be to the company's accounts, there may be a risk that the focus of the audit becomes blurred&#151;as, indeed, does the role of the auditor. Some might argue that if the scope of the auditor's duty is to become as extensive as that, is he not in danger of becoming an investigator rather than an auditor?
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para20"></a>As we understand it, it should be noted that those included in the range of the auditor's rights to information under the provisions of this clause would include anyone who was formerly an employee or officer of the company at any such time&#151;that is in new Section 389A(2)(e). The upshot is that the duty of co-operation goes far beyond those responsible for the company at the time of the audit. Rather, the duty would be imposed so widely, with co-operation demanded of not only "any employee" but also of any past employee. That is indeed a wide definition.
<P>

<a name="40317-07_para21"></a>Bringing all employees within that provision with its criminal sanction not only has drawbacks that may be undesirable to companies, employees and even to auditors, but creates what is essentially a duplication. As we shall debate under later clauses, the directors are under a duty to ensure that the auditors are made aware of all relevant information&#151;at new Section 234ZA, page 12, line 11. Therefore, the scope of this clause should be limited to those engaged in the preparation of company's accounts. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40317-08_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Lyell): </B>  I advise the Committee that if Amendment No. 32 is agreed to, I shall not be able to call Amendment No. 33.
<P>


<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I think that the narrowing of those people who would be obliged to provide information to auditors would be very dangerous. An audit is concerned with the verification of accounts, but in so doing it has to take a judgment over many matters and many items that appear in those accounts. In doing that, it will need information from many people who are not directly, or even indirectly, involved in the preparation of those accounts.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para0"></a>I can think, for example, of an organisation such as an oil and gas company and those responsible for the booking of its reserves, which might have a fairly significant impact on the depreciation charges. None of those people would be directly, or even indirectly, involved in the preparation of the accounts, but they would have a very significant impact on the judgments that could be arrived at in so doing. I am afraid that I cannot support the amendment. I think that it is too narrow.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   In the circumstances of oil and gas reserves that the noble Lord has just described, could he envisage that this would be undertaken by a person who was not an officer of the company?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   Yes, I can. There may well be a situation where the individual responsible for booking the reserves of an oil and gas company may not be a director or an officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The amendments would weaken what the Government propose. I shall speak first to Amendment No. 32, which would amend Clause 8. This would restrict the ability of the auditors to require information and explanations to only those employees engaged in the preparation of the company's accounts. Our purpose is to enable the company auditors to carry out their duties more effectively and thus to increase the reliability of and confidence in company accounts. The noble Lord's amendment would restrict the scope to those employees involved in the preparation of accounts. In our view, that would weaken the provision significantly.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para1"></a>It is a little difficult to know who would be covered by the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"engaged in the preparation of the . . . accounts".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-08_para2"></a>
Even if some fairly wide definition could be found, there may well still be others holding relevant and valuable information who should be under an obligation to answer an auditor's questions.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para3"></a>In practice, the auditors talk to and ask questions of a wide range of employees and this is likely to go well beyond those who could in some sense be said to be involved in the preparation of the company's accounts; to cite a simple example, those who are responsible for the company's stocks. The auditor should be able to require information and explanations from all those employees who he feels may be able to provide such information as he thinks necessary for the performance of his duties as auditor.
<P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para4"></a>The idea that the auditor needs information only from those involved in the preparation of accounts seems to be based on a very outdated view of what an audit is about. For example, it is essential, not least to enable the auditors to assess the risks to the entity, for the auditor to obtain a good knowledge of the business of the entity. An excellent way of obtaining that knowledge may well be by questioning those in a wide range of functions, such as computer personnel, internal auditors and senior operating personnel. All are good examples of such people.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para5"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 76 to Clause 12. This clause provides the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the body which reviews the annual accounts of public and large private companies, with a statutory power to obtain relevant information from the company, and from any officer, employee or auditor of that company. This raises similar issues to those we have already discussed in relation to Clause 8.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para6"></a>To date, the FRRP has relied on voluntary co-operation to get the information it requires, and this has worked. Rarely in practice has the panel encountered difficulties in obtaining what it needs to carry out an investigation. However, with the panel moving on to a more proactive footing and increasing the number of accounts it reviews, there is clearly an increased likelihood, if only in pure number terms, of a company failing to co-operate. We have therefore sought to provide powers for the FRRP in Clause 12 which are wide enough to enable it to have access to all the information and documentation it needs to undertake its work&#151;no more and no less than that.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para7"></a>In most cases, the FRRP will be interested in getting documents or information from those employees who are or were involved in the preparation of the accounts, but that need not always be the case. As I mentioned in the context of Clause 8, there are difficulties of definition. What does it mean to be engaged in the "preparation of the accounts"? There may well be other employees holding some information which would be relevant to the FRRP investigation, and in exceptional or complex cases the FRRP may want to talk to a wide range of employees, not just those involved with the accounts. Again, the example of company stock is an obvious one. Clerical assistants and personal secretaries may also hold valuable information. Is the personal assistant to the finance director a person who is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"involved in the preparation of the company's accounts"?.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-08_para8"></a>
That is a debatable point.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para9"></a>This amendment would introduce an unnecessary degree of uncertainty. It is clearer and better to have a general obligation on employees to comply with requests from the FRRP. But I must emphasise that this is not an unfettered power. Whoever the employee is, under subsection (2) the FRRP can only require the provision of information that it may reasonably need for the purposes of the functions it has been authorised to perform.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para10"></a>While I cannot accept these amendments, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving me the opportunity to outline the Government's intention in these matters. I hope that I have reassured the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord that while our version of these provisions is slightly wider than would be the case if this group of amendments was accepted, what we are introducing is proportionate and, in the case of the FRRP, properly safeguarded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   We did not expect the amendments to be appreciated with open arms, but we wanted a chance to discuss them and the wider issues that come in the next two groups of amendments. I understand the difficulties of definition, and see the recommendations made by various review bodies. I also understand the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, although he was a little abrupt on the question of whether an officer should have passed his opinion on a major issue involving a company. However, I am perfectly happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 33:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 14, leave out "or employee"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-08_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40317-08_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 33, 36 and 77 have been grouped together, and I shall speak to them all. They cover a wider aspect of the arguments that we discussed on the previous group, and propose a more radical solution. We hoped to table them so that we could discuss them before the previous group, but were told by the Table Office that, unfortunately, we had to deal with the other group first due to the way in which we tabled them.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para14"></a>The amendments remove every employee from the auditors' potential line of inquiry. There are two parallel and, at times, overlapping issues on which we wish to probe the Government's thinking. The first is the position of employees of a UK-incorporated company or its UK-incorporated subsidiary, whether they are working in the UK or overseas. The second regards UK companies that have subsidiaries incorporated overseas and the position of their employees, which is dealt with in the next group of amendments. However, Amendments Nos. 33, 36 and 77 deal with the first issue; namely, the extension of auditors' rights to information to include employees of UK-incorporated companies and their UK-incorporated subsidiaries.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para15"></a>The first two amendments withdraw auditors' rights to information extending to all employees. Amendment No. 33 leaves out the employee of the company from the list of those from whom the auditors have rights to information. Amendment No. 36 leaves out the employee of any such subsidiary undertaking from the same list. Amendment No. 77 concerns Clause 12, which is on the power of the authorised person to require documents, information and an explanation. That amendment leaves employees of a company out of the scope of the auditors' rights to information.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clause 8 reflects a recommendation in the Company Law Review".
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para17"></a>
The recommendation was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"employees should be brought within the scope of the current duty and its criminal sanction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-08_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40317-08_para19"></a>We have had a very useful briefing from Mr George Bompas QC, a leading commercial Silk. He tells us that the recommendation appears to have been directed at employees of companies subject to audit in accordance with the Companies Act, not at employees of subsidiary companies&#151;whether or not GB-incorporated&#151;and to have been aimed at imposing on that class of person a direct duty to provide an explanation where the auditors think it necessary for their audit. In other words, the recommendation of the company law review would have been sufficiently dealt with by including, in existing Section 389A(1), "and employees" after "officers", and, in existing Section 389A(2), "or employee" after "officer".
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para20"></a>In fact, the new draft of Section 389A goes further. It extends the range of persons from whom the auditors have the power to require information and explanations. Those newly included under it are: employees of the company; persons holding the company's books, accounts or vouchers; officers, auditors and employees of the company's GB-incorporated subsidiaries; and persons holding the books, accounts and vouchers of any such subsidiaries.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para21"></a>Our amendment focuses on the first of those categories: the employees of the company or its subsidiaries. We examined that extension in the light of the extensions proposed in Section 389B in Clause 8 on page 11, which states that any person giving misleading evidence to an auditor is guilty of a fine, imprisonment, or both. It could be argued that it is quite a leap to include "any employee" within that liability, and going beyond what the company law review suggested.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para22"></a>"Any employee" is a broad category, which may usefully need further defining. At what level does "any employee" stop? Does the clause, for example, extend to the postman and the photocopy attendant? How will they be made aware of the serious nature of the inquiries being made of them and of the consequences which may follow from an answer that may be given capriciously or without due reflection? What is their position if they were to give false information after persuasive instructions from a superior? There is an issue of "equality of arms"&#151;equal knowledge, equal sophistication and equal awareness. It could be too easy for very junior employees to become unwittingly caught up in a maelstrom in no way of their own making. We wish the Government to explain more clearly the parameters of the definition of "any employee" and how the new provision will work.
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para23"></a>Furthermore, the main interest of the auditor is to extract relevant material&#151;be it explanations, statements or documents from the company in <P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question. For that to be achieved with maximum effect, total co-operation is needed from the relevant persons. If the relevant persons are junior employees who are aware that they now fall within a liability that could result in imprisonment, will that cause them to be more or less forthcoming with material?
<P>

<a name="40317-08_para24"></a>The law should unquestionably come down heavily upon a director or an officer who submits misleading, false or deceptive information. A director has obvious obligations to a company as well as a full understanding of the consequences of misleading an auditor. The same cannot be said of every other employee, particularly those of minor ranking. "Employees" should therefore be omitted from this field of responsibility. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   First, I apologise to the noble Lord for my abruptness. If he felt that I was abrupt, it is only a reflection of how deeply held are my views.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para0"></a>The issue that we come up against here is one that we touched on yesterday&#151;the conflict between the legal and the accountancy professions. We have enough problems with auditing at the moment; auditing is under pressure, has been criticised widely and, in many cases, access to information has been restricted. If one considers auditing failures, one will find time and again that they happened because of restricted access or because access has been in some way curbed.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para1"></a>I contrast that with the Government's attitude and the general international development towards encouraging whistleblowing. If one is going to encourage whistleblowing, one must have a process that responds to that. Part of that process means that the individual employee has to feel responsible for blowing the whistle when something is going wrong. I find it very difficult to see how one removes the responsibility from the individual employee to provide the information that the auditor wants and at the same time say that he must blow the whistle if he sees something going wrong. There is a conflict here, which we need to be careful in resolving.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para2"></a>I always start from the basis that an auditor must have unrestricted access. To restrict access means effectively that one is saying that one is not going to let him do his job properly. We must be very careful about pulling back those parameters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   In some senses, these amendments cover old ground. I will not repeat the arguments about why employees should be covered. I see no need to set limits on the questioning of employees. Obviously, the auditors will have queries only for those who may have relevant information. Although, in practice, that may involve asking the postman for information, that may be the best way of finding out what is happening in the company. I do not think that we need worry too much about where the line is drawn.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para3"></a>The noble Lord raised one new and very important question&#151;the argument that Clause 8 imposes too great a burden on employees. He argues that the Bill's requirements place an unreasonable burden on the <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employee. Of course, we recognise the need to strike the right balance between the rights of the auditors and the burdens placed on employees. We think that the clause achieves just that.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para4"></a>I emphasise that there are important protections for the employee. The employee does not commit an offence simply by giving information that turns out to be false or by failing to give that information. The information must be false in a material particular. The employee must have known that the statement was false or have been reckless as to whether it was false. The employee is protected against self-incrimination, and the employee is able to show by way of defence that it was not reasonably practicable to provide the information.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para5"></a>There is another issue. The employee may still be in an impossible position when, for example, a manager makes it clear that he does not expect employees to co-operate with the auditor. There may be circumstances in which it proves difficult for the employee. However, those are likely to be cases where the management has something important to hide from the auditor. Placing an obligation on the employee, as this clause does, overrides any duties of confidentiality that the employee might otherwise owe to the company.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para6"></a>Employment law has, of course, long allowed employees, subject to qualifying service, to complain to an employment tribunal if they believe that they have been dismissed unfairly. A dismissal where the employee is simply fulfilling his legal obligation under this clause would almost certainly be an unfair one.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para7"></a>Finally, how will employees be aware of their obligation? We will, of course, expect companies to make their employees aware of the obligation. It is also for the auditors to make the position clear to employees when requiring information from them. I hope that I have demonstrated to the noble Lord why employees should be covered. As for this group of amendments, we think that the employee would have proper protection if he provided information to the auditors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I entirely appreciate my noble friend's case that the auditor must be entitled to the kind of information that he is describing. However, he said that if an employee was in some way disadvantaged&#151;I think he said "dismissed"&#151;then he would "almost certainly" find that he is justified in any other proceedings. Does my noble friend think it would perhaps be sensible to consider striking out the "almost" and making other provision in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   That is an extremely important point, which is quite properly covered in the normal way. If a person were dismissed, that would be a matter for an employment tribunal. I do not think that anything is added to his protection simply by saying that he is protected in that way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister, particularly for listing the protections available to employees, especially junior employees, <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 17, leave out from "company" to end of line 18 and insert "including subsidiaries outside the United Kingdom"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-09_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40317-09_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to the second barrel, so to speak. This is a group of six amendments that deal with the other half of the issue; that is, employees outside the United Kingdom. Here, a distinction is being drawn between UK-incorporated subsidiaries and subsidiaries incorporated outside the UK. At Second Reading, we raised and recognised the difficult questions involving extra-territorial jurisdiction. These amendments are designed to probe and question and to encourage the Government to illuminate their thinking on this point.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para12"></a>Amendment No. 35 alters the auditors' rights to information from being limited to "any subsidiary undertaking, which is a body corporate incorporated in Great Britain" to "any subsidiary undertaking, including subsidiaries outside the United Kingdom". Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 41 are consequential. They seek to remove subsections (3), (4) and (5) of new Section 389A, which explain the distinctions between the treatment of subsidiary undertakings incorporated inside Great Britain and those incorporated outside.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 75 and 78 concern Clause 12 and the issue that we considered in the earlier groups. They face the other way and seek to include the company's subsidiaries within the power of the authorised person to require documents, information and explanations. Nevertheless, they raise the same issues of extra-territoriality, so we have grouped them.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para14"></a>Under the Bill, the officers and employees of a subsidiary incorporated outside Great Britain are not under any duty to respond to requests for information or explanations and, as I understand it, cannot be made criminally liable.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para15"></a>Subsections (3), (4) and (5) of new Section 389A explain that, imposing instead upon the parent company the duty of obtaining from the subsidiary, its officers, auditors, employees, and persons holding the subsidiary's books, accounts or vouchers, or any former officers, information or explanations reasonably required by the parent company's auditors. That different regime applies even though the subsidiary incorporated outside Great Britain may be carrying on business inside the United Kingdom and, indeed, may have a greater UK presence than a GB-incorporated subsidiary of the same parent which is carrying on all its business outside the United <P>


<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kingdom. In other words, an overseas subsidiary may be doing business in the UK greater than that of the parent company itself.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para16"></a>The thinking behind those provisions seems to be that it would be wrong to impose duties and criminal sanctions on foreigners. However, the proposal for separate regimes applicable in the case of GB-incorporated companies on the one hand and non-GB incorporated companies on the other must be seen to be crude and unsatisfactory. That is particularly true when bearing in mind that employees and persons holding documents of a company may have no idea whether the company that employs them is a GB or a non-GB incorporated company, and that their own duty and liability will depend not on the place where they are based or where the company carries on its business, but on the accident of the place of incorporation of the company that employs them.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para17"></a>The Government claim that the Bill is part of their strategy to help restore investor confidence in companies following recent corporate failures. Others have less kindly called it a knee-jerk reaction. But however described, the Bill is largely the product of recent mishaps in America with WorldCom and Enron. The only comparable financial debacle in the UK is the events concerning Barings Bank. Problems and fraud within Barings Securities Singapore as an offshore subsidiary of Barings brought down the parent. Yet under the Bill, there will be no direct authority to go into the affairs of the Singapore company. Is that a sensible and coherent approach?
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para18"></a>The intention of the amendments taken as a whole is to put overseas subsidiaries on a level playing field with UK subsidiaries. The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, said that accountants need unrestricted and unfettered access. So be it. We do not underestimate the difficulties of this approach, but if restoring investor confidence is really what the Government are seeking to achieve, that would be best achieved by including subsidiaries incorporated outside the United Kingdom within the jurisdiction covered in Clause 8, providing for a single regime applicable wherever the subsidiary is incorporated.
<P>

<a name="40317-09_para19"></a>If the Government feel that that is too extreme for foreign jurisdictions and wish to keep the distinction, the rational solution would be to use Amendment No. 36 and remove subsidiaries' employees from these provisions. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40317-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am grateful to have this opportunity to discuss the issues raised by the noble Lord's amendments, which relate to the issue of group auditors and overseas subsidiaries. I should like to begin by addressing the amendments to Clause 8&#151;that is, Amendments Nos. 35, 38, 39 and 41. Perhaps I can explain why we cannot support these amendments and then comment on some of the wider concerns raised at Second Reading about the auditors' right to information from an overseas subsidiary.
<P>


<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, mentioned at Second Reading the example of Barings Bank, where a failed overseas subsidiary brought down the whole company; and, of course, the role of overseas subsidiaries seems to be a significant element in the Parmalat case. I do not think our response can be described as "knee-jerk". We gave careful deliberations to the whole issue before bringing forward these carefully judged changes.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para1"></a>Amendment No. 35, the substantive amendment, would place obligations on overseas subsidiaries, their directors, employees and some others. It would introduce an extra-territorial element into the legal rights conferred on auditors. In all likelihood the only connection such people have to Great Britain is that they are directors of, or are employed by, a company which happens to have a GB company as its holding company. I accept the noble Lord's point that there may be cases where such companies have significant operations in the UK. We do not intend to impose direct obligations and penalties on such persons.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para2"></a>Of course it seems desirable to place such direct obligations on those who have the relevant information, but we do not think this is reasonable or likely to be effective. In practice, it would be very difficult to enforce the obligations that could arise as a result of the amendment. It is not a practical way of ensuring that auditors of an international group headed by a GB parent get all the information they need. In any event, to claim jurisdiction on that basis risks undermining our position in resisting claims by foreign states to exercise jurisdiction in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para3"></a>Nevertheless, we share the concerns expressed that what happens in an overseas subsidiary is all too often the cause of serious problems or worse for an international group. Barings Bank and Parmalat are high profile examples of that. There is a role for the law in facilitating the auditor's access to information on overseas subsidiaries. Thus, both the existing law and the Bill place a specific requirement on a GB parent, when asked by the auditor, to take all reasonable steps to obtain the required information from the subsidiary. We think that is the best approach and we think it is effective.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para4"></a>There is a criminal sanction against the parent provided for in new Section 389B; and, very importantly, the auditor, under Section 237(3), must state if he has not received all the information and explanations necessary for the purpose of his audit. Any indication by the auditor that he may make such a statement unless he gets adequate information about the subsidiary is likely to focus the minds of the directors of the parent company very sharply indeed.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para5"></a>Let me now turn to the similar amendments which the noble Lord proposes to Clause 12. I briefly remind the Committee that Clause 12 provides the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the body which reviews the annual accounts of public and large private companies, with a statutory power to obtain relevant information from the company and from any officer, employee or auditor of the company.
<P>


<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para6"></a>The points raised by the noble Lord about subsidiary companies are interesting and I shall do my best to address them. In order to do so, I need first to distinguish between domestic subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries. In respect of the former, we do not believe that the clause needs to make any special provision. We are trying to keep the powers of the FRRP as straightforward as possible. It seems to us that all that is required is the power to require the documents, information and explanations from the company whose accounts are being looked at. That may include relevant information about subsidiaries where this is pertinent to the group's accounts, because group accounts are, of course, the accounts of the parent company.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para7"></a>If the FRRP concluded that as a result of its investigations into the parent company it should also carry out a review of the accounts of a subsidiary company, it could open an investigation into the accounts of that company and then, of course, use the Clause 12 powers in relation to that company as well. It would have to satisfy the criterion set out in Clause 12(1)&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that there is, or may be, a question whether the annual accounts of a company comply with the requirements of this Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-10_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40317-10_para9"></a>The case of overseas subsidiaries is somewhat different, and what I have just said about the amendments to Clause 8 applies here as well. It is neither straightforward nor generally desirable to empower a UK regulator or auditor to require overseas companies to produce documents. I do not think that it is worth going into all the arguments again other than to emphasise the point that this would introduce an undesirable extra-territorial element. We do not think that that approach would be reasonable or desirable or, above all, effective. So it is not a practical way of ensuring that the FRRP obtains the information it requires to undertake its work. On those grounds, it will be clear why we should like to keep the clause as it stands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   As I said, I understand the issue of extra-territoriality, which is clearly sensitive. Our difficulty with the present proposal may be made clear with a practical example. A UK company has a French subsidiary incorporated in France and shares an office with the French sales subsidiary of a UK-incorporated company. Two people could be sitting next to each other at their desks because they happen to operate out of the same office. However, one person would be criminally liable for information given while the other would have absolutely no obligation. That is where we encounter the hard point of the issue, and whether it is a sufficiently hard point to deal with the question of extra-territoriality&#151;one that is complex and has major inward implications for the United Kingdom&#151;requires further reflection.

But never mind that. We hope that this amendment will provide a nice alternative for the Government.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para15"></a>Subsection (5) provides that when an auditor requires information from an overseas subsidiary, the parent company must obtain the information from the person concerned. However, in line 40 the subsection does not specify that the "person concerned" is a person attached to the undertaking as described in paragraphs (4)(a) to (d). For the purposes of clarity, we believe that the term "persons concerned" in subsection (5) should refer explicitly to the previous paragraph. I beg to move.

I hope that I shall not be accused of unfair prejudice towards accountants if I say that I have some sympathy with the points made by both noble Lords on this.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para16"></a>I do not think that the phrase could be interpreted as referring to any person other than one of those listed in subsection (4), from whom the auditor has required the parent company to obtain information. Nevertheless, the basic thrust of this amendment is right in that it seeks to spell out to whom the phrase "person concerned" refers. However, I cannot accept the amendment as it stands, not least because it refers to persons being "defined in subsection (4)", when in fact these persons are listed rather than defined.

<a name="40317-10_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40317-10_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 43 deals with an issue that we have touched on of late, which I might describe broadly as yet further fettering of the auditors' access. Proposed new Section 389A(7)&#151;an exception for legally privileged information&#151;would, if enacted, result in a scaling back of the auditors' current rights to information. Current practice is that such information is available to auditors. It is quite important in the auditors' forming an opinion, certainly on disclosure of contingent liabilities, where there are major cases of litigation.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para20"></a>If the auditors were denied access to such information, it is questionable whether they would be able to form an opinion on whether the accounts gave a true and fair view. As a result, they would have to qualify their approval. Moreover, I cannot see how disclosure of such information to the auditor would prejudice the matter to which the information related. The auditor needs the information to form a true and fair view. He does not need to publicise it to any other party. If the information relates to litigation between the auditor and the entity, the auditor would of course not be able to act anyway, so he would have resigned.
<P>

<a name="40317-10_para21"></a>We note that, quite rightly, there is no equivalent exception in Clause 9, which deals with the directors' disclosures. The information in regard to such matters would have to be volunteered in some way. Therefore, the exception in Clause 8 is an ineffective anomaly and needs to be removed. I beg to move.

When an audit occurs, the normal format in relation to any form of litigation&#151;potential claims or actual litigation going on&#151;is that the auditors will write to the company, asking for an opinion from the firm of solicitors advising it about the litigation. They will ask whether there is a potential claim and what the potential magnitude is.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para0"></a>As a former practising solicitor, I assure Members of the Committee that, when that letter arrives from the company or the auditors, it is a serious matter for the firm of solicitors. If they write an opinion that indicates that the claim is scurrilous or on the other hand potentially worth &#163;125 billion, there is serious potential liability for that firm of lawyers if the statement is wrong. If the clause were implemented in its current form, as surely as night follows day, any firm of solicitors worth its salt, when asked for that opinion by either the company or the auditors, would simply say, "I'm terribly sorry; that is a matter of legal professional privilege and, under Section 8(7) of the new companies Act I do not have to provide it".
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para1"></a>We will actually have endless company reports where the auditors say, "We have to qualify the accounts because we cannot form a true and fair view". <P>


<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The reason that they will not be able to do so is that the firm involved&#151;Linklaters, Freshfields, Slaughter and May or whoever&#151;will have written a letter quoting the clause and saying, "I'm terribly sorry; we can't give an opinion". It will relieve endless firms of solicitors and insurers of professional firms from their potential concerns on the issue. Therefore, I would have thought that the clause, which is apparently small, would have a devastating impact on the production of companies' accounts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I do not wish to be seen again as the voice of the legal profession, but we have some concerns about the proposal to remove subsection (7) because of the fundamental nature of legal professional privilege and its removal being undesirable except in exceptional circumstances. As we have said in previous debates, we are in favour of facilitating the auditor's right to information, and the immunity of professional privilege embodies a substantial legal right that should not be easily overridden. However, we are not sure that the case made here justifies that approach.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, referred to the impact on companies' accounts but, if I were a director of a company and the result was that my accounts would be qualified, I would go to my solicitors and say, "I would like this sorted out because I do not want to find myself with a qualification on my accounts". That is far more dangerous than anything else.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para3"></a>As a director of a company, I would want the auditors to sign on to a true and fair view. Their great power is to refuse to sign unless they get the information to enable them to do so. In those circumstances, what is proposed here tackles and weakens a fundamental civil and legal right. On the arguments we have heard so far, I am not convinced that we should give it our support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   When a lawyer and an accountant join forces, one should look very carefully at what is being proposed. In this case, I think that the lawyer rather than the accountant is probably on the stronger ground.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para4"></a>The aim of Clause 8 is to increase the ability of auditors to carry out their duties effectively, thus increasing the reliability of, and confidence in, a company's accounts. It achieves this by strengthening the existing rights of company auditors to obtain information and explanations by entitling the auditor to require information and explanations from a wider group of people and by introducing a criminal offence for the failure to provide such information.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para5"></a>The Committee should note that I said "strengthening the existing rights of company auditors". It is not our intention that Clause 8 should change the position in respect of legal professional privilege. Subsection (7) therefore makes it explicit that an auditor cannot require a person to give information which is subject to legal professional privilege.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para6"></a>We believe that it is desirable to make this explicit because the Bill creates a new criminal offence in new Section 389B(2), inserted by Clause 8, where a person <P>


<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fails to comply with a requirement to provide information or explanations. There is an issue as to whether disclosure to the auditors of such information would involve an infringement of legal professional privilege, given the particular nature of the relationship between the company and the auditor.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para7"></a>However, the auditor's duties may involve the disclosure to the public of the information he obtains if it calls into question the truth or fairness of the accounts. Although the arguments are finely balanced, we believe that this would mean that a disclosure to an auditor of information subject to legal professional privilege might lead to disclosure to the public and thus involve an infringement of that privilege.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para8"></a>Thus, as the law stands, we think it unlikely that auditors currently have the power to require officers of a company to produce information in respect of which legal professional privilege could be claimed. The Bill puts that beyond doubt in the context of the new criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para9"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that the problem raised by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is in practice not a serious issue because of the way in which companies would behave. Where an auditor believes that he is not receiving the required information for the purpose of his duties as an auditor, on the basis that such information was subject to legal professional privilege, he would consider whether to qualify his report on the accounts. We believe that, faced with this possibility, the directors would choose whether to waive their right to legal professional privilege and disclose the information to the auditor, or to protect the privileged information and risk the adverse consequences of qualified accounts. We believe it is clear what decision they are likely to take. On that basis, we oppose the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   This privilege is a very important right, but it is not a divine right. What is at stake here, if I have understood the matter at all, is what the auditor has a right to know. It is the very important issue of producing proper accounts. My noble friend mentioned Parmalat and other dreadful matters, of which very little is said here. But that is becoming increasingly important to a wider and wider sector of the community, and to the public interest. Is it really necessary to include a clause that simply makes a pronouncement of legal professional privilege a complete barrier, no matter what the course of action in the litigation or the parties involved, and no matter what else is involved?
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para10"></a>Would it not be possible to produce a more limited clause giving legal professional privilege in some areas its right as an answer but not as absolute as in the Bill? I do not know, I must admit, what is the position of the professional bodies on the matter, but I should be very surprised if all lawyers demanded this absolute subsection, which really seems to go very far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   Following on from that, I should like to give a practical example. If I may dare to be so bold, the Minister, whose brief was probably written before <P>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he heard what my noble friend Lord Sharman or I had to say on the topic, has not actually answered the question.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para11"></a>Let us take the example of Enron. Suppose that we had an Enron situation in the United Kingdom; and the Crown Prosecution Service, if it was still called that, chose to launch prosecutions against the Enron-equivalent directors before the audited accounts had been produced. The clause would mean that anyone involved in producing the audit or in what had happened would be able to say to the auditors, "I am terribly sorry, but I am not gong to disclose the information you have asked for because I am protected by Clause 8(7)". That would be because,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a claim to legal professional privilege",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-11_para12"></a>
would apply in relation to all those matters, because a prosecution had been launched. That cannot be right.
<P>

<a name="40317-11_para13"></a>It cannot be the intention of the legislation to enable people to shelter behind legal professional privilege in failing to give information to the auditors. Incidentally, auditors under their own professional rules would be under an obligation not to disclose. They can disclose the conclusion that they draw&#151;that this forms a true and fair view and that in their belief there must be a contingent liability note that Enron owes 125 billion dollars to whomever. But there is no obligation on the auditors to disclose to the public any information that they have. In those circumstances, the company and its professional advisers could simply shelter behind the clause and fail to give the auditors the information. That cannot be right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Of course, my answer was drafted very carefully before I heard the words of the noble Lord, but I thought that the anticipation was very good and answered exactly his point. As I hope that I made clear, in practice, any company faced with an auditor threatening to qualify the accounts because he could not get hold of the information would, without any question, unless there was something appalling to hide, ask for the legal privilege to be waived. Therefore, in the specific matter of auditors considering accounts, I cannot see that that would in any way impede people getting the information.

<A NAME="40317-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   This is a new criminal charge, so the situation should be clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   It is important to understand the nature of the qualification that would result. There would be a withdrawal of opinion, which would not mean that the accounts do not present or that they present subject to certain matters; it would mean, "We cannot form an opinion", which does not take us anywhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   With the greatest respect, I did not find my noble friend's reply totally <P>


<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>convincing. One is always suspicious of the argument that a legal provision that appears to be absolute will not work like that in practice, because the next thing you come up with is that the case regarded by the authority as exceptional is where it does work like that. As I understood him, my noble friend accepted the argument on Enron. Having done a certain amount of reading on Enron, I was not entirely sure that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, could not be criticised in his argument. Broadly speaking, however, my noble friend appears to accept that, in an Enron situation, the clause would be the answer and the end of the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   If Enron had come forward and said, "Our accounts are being qualified by the auditor because he cannot get hold of this legal information", even in the state of market opinion that we have sometimes had, I can see no circumstances in which a company could deal with that. The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, who probably has much greater expertise in the area, seems to believe that companies can tell the Stock Exchange, "Our accounts are qualified because we cannot get hold of this legal advice", and that people will say that that is a minor technicality. I fear that I do not believe that that is how the world works.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para0"></a>Clearly noble Lords have strong views on the issue. In particular, there is the question of whether, in subsequent investigations as opposed to the initial stages, there is an issue about auditors' rights of information. We certainly do not intend to scale back on the auditors' rights of information. On that basis, I should very much like to take another look at the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   When the Minister looks at the amendment, will he consider the proposition that a qualification that results from an inability to obtain information is normally an expression of what is known as a "no opinion", meaning "We are unable to form an opinion". In circumstances where the information withheld is so catastrophic or important to the formation of that view, there may be a board of directors that would regard that as a better solution than providing the information and the consequent opinion that would flow therefrom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   That obviously raises questions about the noble Lord's clients. We will take the matter away and look at it.

<P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 7, leave out "statement (oral or written)" and insert "written statement"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-12_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40317-12_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: We are still winding our way through Clause 8, on auditors' rights to information. This amendment relates to new Clause 389B, on the <P>


<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>offences relating to the provision of information to auditors. Punishment for those offences includes imprisonment, so it is a serious matter.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para4"></a>The Bill gives auditors the option to take statements in written or oral form. Our amendments seek to limit the auditor to taking written statements because of the risk of errors and misunderstanding that could arise from relying on oral statements alone. Let us consider the practicalities of the provision. For example, as a director of a company, I may be interviewed by the auditor and he or she may make notes of my remarks, which may well be written up, if at all, in a hotel room or office hours or days later. What I think I said and what the auditor thought I said could be very different, not for reasons of malice but because of the jumbled process of normal human communication. This amendment is designed to avoid those complications by forcing auditors to prepare written statements, where relevant, and to obtain a sign-off.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para5"></a>I am aware that the unamended formulation of words is to be found in Section 389A(2) of the Companies Act 1989, but there are some important points to be made. First, on effectiveness, according to legal advice, only one case about the use of oral evidence has been brought since the provisions of the Act came into force. That hardly argues that it is a hugely effective and important provision. Some might argue that, if the provisions cause so few problems, it could be left in. The Minister will know that I am not of that persuasion and believe that, where provisions have not been regularly used over a long period, they should be removed.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para6"></a>The second point relates to extent. As we have already discussed, Section 389A(2) currently extends liability only to officers of the company, but it is now to be extended to any employee. Accordingly, if potentially incriminating statements are to be taken from a much broader and varying range of company employees, including very junior ones, there is reason to argue that the process of statement-taking requires extra diligence.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para7"></a>Finally, there is the issue of proportionality. There is no doubt that we live in an increasingly litigious age, and that the pressure, weight and responsibility on the director of a company increases all the time. In principle, we do not and cannot object to that, but for a non-executive director to find himself or herself in hugely time-consuming, extensive and reputation-damaging litigation that may continue for years because of an oral statement that he or she made is, to say the least, a disincentive to serving on a board.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para8"></a>In summary, the statement given by an officer or employee under the provisions could possibly lead to their imprisonment. We do not believe that notes taken by an auditor from an employee's oral statement have the thoroughness and accuracy that is necessary. Oral statements can often be misleading, and emphasis placed on the wrong word can change the entire meaning of a sentence. Any notes of the speeches that we make in Committee this afternoon will probably differ in little ways, and mistakes may even be made. I  dare say that the near-faultless and untiring <P>


<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Hansard writers very occasionally make a mistake, and they rightly consider themselves one of the most practised, professional oral note-takers in the country.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para9"></a>Considering the liability involved, the breadth of those who will now be liable, and the increasing resort to litigation that is part of our society, it seems right that auditors should rely only on written statements. To those who say that the issue is irrelevant because the provision will never be able to be used in a court of law, I reply: why bother to include it? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am not entirely surprised that over all those years there has been only one case of a misleading oral statement. After all, it is much more difficult to prove that an oral statement has been made, because many meetings between auditors and the directors and employees of companies may be on a one-to-one basis, so there may not be much evidence. Inevitably, there is a difficulty of proving that a misleading oral statement has been made. But that should not lead us to delete the word "oral" and confine the possibility of an offence to written statements. After all, there must be some occasions when very seriously misleading oral statements are made. If&#151;naturally, it is a very big "if"&#151;that can be established by adequate evidence, why should not that offence be considered proved?
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para10"></a>The noble Lord has made perfectly reasonable points about the maximum punishment, but that is in the hands of the court, and will no doubt depend on the seriousness of the matter and what is justified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Surely my noble friend is right. Would not the effect of the amendment&#151;to put it somewhat softly perhaps; but with no hostile intent to the noble Lord who moved it&#151;be that, instead of saying, "Thou shalt not make deceptive statements knowingly or recklessly", it would say, "Thou shalt not make such statements if they are reduced to writing". It is a quite extraordinary provision to put on the statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Clause 8 contains important provisions on the rights of auditors to obtain information. These derive mostly from the existing law, but with the significant change that those required to provide information and explanations to the auditor include employees for the first time. That change reflects clear recommendations from both the Company Law Review Group and the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting. Auditors should be able to ask for information, and expect truthful answers, from as many as possible of those likely to have information necessary for the successful performance of the audit. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that this amendment effectively says, "You can make inaccurate statements as long as you do not put them in writing".
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para11"></a>The noble Lord's amendment would make the task that we have set ourselves more difficult. Of course, there may be greater difficulty in proving that oral information is false or misleading than is the case where information is written. But that is not a good reason for excluding oral information from the scope <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the offence. To do so would simply send a signal that it is all right to give a misleading oral statement to the auditors. It is important to uphold, not weaken, the principle that those giving information to an auditor have an obligation to do so honestly.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para12"></a>I think that accepting the noble Lord's amendment would mean that we are taking a step backwards from the current law in this area and would weaken the Bill. Let us remember that the point of the Bill is to increase the effectiveness of auditing, even if it is not used a great deal. I think it sends entirely the right signal&#151;that we are very concerned to increase the effectiveness of auditing.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para13"></a>We considered the position of employees very carefully in relation to the criminal offence, precisely because they may be less aware&#151;than the directors, for example&#151;of the possible consequences of what they say. We think that the clause gets the balance right between protecting the individual and meeting its purpose. In particular, as I said, to be guilty of an offence, a person must "knowingly or recklessly" provide information which is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-12_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40317-12_para15"></a>Secondly, it is open to a person charged with an offence to show by way of a defence that it was not reasonably practicable for him to provide the required information. Thirdly, the information given cannot be used against him in criminal proceedings for any other offence.
<P>

<a name="40317-12_para16"></a>In those circumstances, I think it right and proper to say that all statements by employees, oral or written, should come within the scope of the law. On that basis, we oppose the amendments.

<A NAME="40317-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I understand the points made by the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Wedderburn. I suppose that my practical answer to their point is that if I am making a reckless oral statement to the auditor and the auditor believes that I am doing so, the auditor could say, "Will you now please put that in writing?" In our earlier debate on Amendment No. 31, we suggested that the auditor should have powers to require that matters be put in writing.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para0"></a>Our concern, and the reason why we tabled this probing amendment, is that there will be an increasing amount of litigation&#151;not necessarily because corporate behaviour is less good, but because people are much more aware of their legal rights and how to exercise them. One of the characteristics of those rights is that they take a long time to reach fruition. Directors can spend a long time with a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. It is a disincentive for good quality people to sit on boards. We therefore wished to probe the Government's thinking on oral statements, which, in the vernacular, can be "flaky". We thought it might be worthwhile to discuss the possibility of placing on such statements the constraints that we have suggested. However, I understand where the Government are coming from. In the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40317-13_para7"></a>The additional statement requires that at the time of the approval of the report, there is no information of a particular description that has not been disclosed to the company's auditors under Section 234ZA(1). The description of the information in proposed subsection 234ZA(2) is information that any director knows, or which it would be reasonable for him to obtain by making inquiries, and which he knows, or ought to know, to be relevant for the purposes of the auditors' determination of whether companies' accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the 1985 Act and, finally, information which he knows, or ought to know, the auditors do not know.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para8"></a>Where the statement is made and is untrue, every director of the company will be guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment, a fine or both, subject to the director himself failing to take all reasonable steps to prevent the approval of the statement when he either knew the statement was false or was reckless as to its falsity under Section 234(7).

<a name="40317-13_para9"></a>According to paragraph 48 of the Explanatory Notes accompanying the Bill, Clause 9 is designed to,

The warranty which, in effect, each director is required to give by the inclusion of the proposed new statement in the directors' report, is not only that he has himself given to the auditors any relevant information fitting the descriptions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 234ZA(2), but also that each and every other director of the company has also given to the auditor the information he or she should have. In other words, not only are directors bound to search out what they know, or should know, is relevant to the audit, and make sure that the auditors know about it, they are also bound to search out and make sure that each and every other of their fellow directors has done the same thing.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para15"></a>Let us reflect on what this means in reality. For example, a non-executive director on, say, a 15-person board is taking responsibility for every other director, including members of the executive team, for failing to disclose to the auditors relevant information, and is doing so on pain of potential imprisonment. That surely fails the test of balance. Of course each individual director can, and must, take responsibility for his or her actions, but to take responsibility for the actions of all his or her board colleagues is not reasonable. So the amendments limit each director's liability to responsibility for his own actions.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para16"></a>Amendment No. 45 amends subsection (2A) by making sure that before,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the report is approved under section 234A each director shall ensure that the auditors are aware of the information required of him by section 234ZA(1)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para17"></a>
That ensures that the director accepts and undertakes a direct responsibility before the report is approved. That has the consequential effect of deleting subsection (1) of new Section 234ZA as per Amendment No. 53, because it is no longer necessary.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para18"></a>Amendment No. 48 then replaces subsection (7) of Section 234, and states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a directors' report is approved under section 234A but the auditors are unaware of information which, as regards any director, is information required by section 234ZA(1), and the director failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the report from being approved, the director is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment or a fine, or both".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40317-13_para20"></a>That withdraws the reference to subsection (2B) and withdraws further whether the director knew that the statement was false or reckless, which is not necessary as it is covered by existing statute. It can be seen that the wording from the Bill to the effect that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the director failed to take all reasonable steps",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para21"></a>
remains in our amendment. While we approve of the duty being placed on the director, it would be helpful if the Minister would explain the Government's thinking on the definition of "reasonable steps" in the light of this new legislation and, indeed, of modern legal practice.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40317-13_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 53, 56 and 58 amend subsections (1) and (2) of new Section 234ZA, which is entitled:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Information to have been disclosed to auditors before directors' report approved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para23"></a>
The amendments replace subsection (2) so that it reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Information is required of a director of a company as mentioned in section 234(2A) if",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para24"></a>
the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"director . . .  is aware of the information or it would be reasonable for a director . . .  to obtain the information by making enquiries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-13_para25"></a>
Paragraphs (b) and (c) continue unamended. With subsection (1) of new Section 234ZA removed by Amendment No. 53, Amendment No. 62 renumbers the subsections so that subsection (2) becomes subsection (1).
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para26"></a>The punishment for a negligent director who contravenes Section 234ZA will remain the same, but the amendments make it implicit that the director has a clear personal responsibility to ensure that the auditors have the required information. At the same time, they relieve directors of any joint liability. The wording in the Bill, especially in new subsection (7) in Section 234, fails to make that clear. Hence the necessity for the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Because of the nature of our procedures, I could not ask the noble Lord while he was still semi-recumbent a question about his rather complicated argument, which I may have failed to follow. If so, I apologise.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para27"></a>As I understood it, he was arguing that Clause 9 as it stands makes the director responsible in virtually every case when one of his fellow directors is at fault. Does he base his opposition on the fact that in such cases the director cannot have taken all reasonable steps, or is there something else in Clause 9 that I have missed, which is the ground for his argument? I should have thought that, if he is resting on the proposition that the director must take all reasonable steps, there would be cases when a director would not be responsible for the fault of his fellow directors, and the responsibility in the clause is indeed personal. I may have misunderstood the noble Lord, and I thought it better to clear up that very simple point at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   Perhaps I may answer that question&#151;I have not become recumbent. As we understand the proposal for the new statement, the drafting requires that a director, in approving the statement, must ensure that all his fellow directors have complied with it. It is joint, several liability, not a single liability.
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para28"></a>On later amendments, we will discuss the issue of what information is required. It is very wide-ranging and includes a number of statements, in particular about what the auditors know or ought to know. It is difficult enough for a director to know in respect of himself, but it is even more difficult for him to know exactly how well other members of the board&#151;for example, a chief executive who is working in the company day to day&#151;have complied with the requirement.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-13_para29"></a>If, however, the Minister says that we misinterpreted the clause, and that there is only a single responsibility, not joint responsibility for the activities or disclosures of the directors, clearly some of my argument falls away. But we are advised that, as currently drafted, the provision creates a joint responsibility, not a single one.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Clause 9 introduces an important new requirement that the directors' report must include a statement that information required to be disclosed to the company's auditors by the directors has been so disclosed. Given its importance, I wish to spend a few moments answering the questions raised.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para0"></a>The amendments would remove the requirement for such a statement, replacing it with a requirement on each director to ensure that the auditors are aware of the required information. We have listened carefully to what has been said. I understand the concern that we should not impose disproportionate or unreasonable requirements on directors, particularly non-executive directors. I want to explain why I do not think that that is the case, and why we should not change the Bill as suggested in the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para1"></a>First, I should explain why requiring the directors' report to include a statement is the best way of achieving our objective of strengthening the auditors' position. The statement provides the spur and focus for each director to think hard about whether he or she is aware of any information that it is important for the auditors to know; it encourages directors to discuss this prior to approving their report. The statement is an outward sign that they have done that. The alternative approach in the amendments is much less satisfactory; it would simply place a general requirement on each director.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para2"></a>Secondly, although we do not want one director to take responsibility for the failings of others, we think it right that a director should have regard to his or her fellow directors when considering his or her position with regard to disclosure. Let me explain&#151;this is perhaps the key&#151;why we do not believe that the clause imposes an unreasonable requirement on a company director. I want to be clear, however, that we do not intend to let off the hook a director who is tempted to mislead; a director who knows that another director is concealing critical information but turns a blind eye; or indeed a director who simply could not care whether his fellow directors were concealing information.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para3"></a>The best way in which I can explain why the provisions are balanced and fair is simply to outline what a director would need to do to fall foul of the requirements. The statement of disclosure of information that is required to be in the directors' report applies only to information that meets all the following three criteria. First, the director must be aware of the information, or it must be reasonable for him to obtain the information by making enquiries. There is a separate amendment to explore what is meant by "reasonable" in this context, so I suggest that we do not consider it now.
<P>


<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para4"></a>Secondly, the director either must know or ought to know that the information is relevant for the auditor's determination of his report under Section 235; that it is relevant to the auditor reaching a view that the accounts meet the requirements of the Act. In particular, it must fulfil the requirement that the accounts give a true and fair view. Again, there is a separate amendment on what we mean by "ought to know". I suggestion we leave the discussion on that until later.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para5"></a>Thirdly, the director must know or ought to know that the auditors are not aware of the information. If information exists which comes within the above criteria and which is not disclosed to the auditors, the statement in the directors' report will be false. However, a director does not commit an offence simply by virtue of the statement in the directors' report being false. He or she must know that it is false&#151;for example, because of knowledge that other directors are withholding information&#151;or must be reckless as to whether it was false&#151;for example, because a director does not care whether or not it is false. This is already, deliberately, a stiff test for the prosecution to show is the case.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para6"></a>In addition, the director must have failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the directors' report being approved. Again, there is a separate amendment to explore that specific provision. The clause does not mean that every director is guilty of an offence simply because one of the directors has concealed key information. Nor does it mean that all directors are treated the same regardless of their function; quite the opposite. What it is reasonable to expect, for example, the finance director to inquire into is likely to be different to what it is reasonable to expect a non-executive director to inquire into. As the clause explicitly makes clear in new Section 234ZA(3), what a director ought to know relates both to the knowledge, skill and experience that can be reasonably expected of someone carrying out their functions and to their actual knowledge, skill and experience.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para7"></a>The noble Lord asked what is meant by Section 234 new subsection (7)(b) where a director takes or fails to take,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reasonable steps to prevent the [directors'] report from being approved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-14_para8"></a>
The purpose of new subsection (7)(b) is to protect the director who does his best to prevent the approval of a directors' report containing a statement concerning disclosure to auditors that he knows to be false. It would be for the prosecution to show that the director had failed to take reasonable steps. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para9"></a>In conclusion, the requirements imposed on directors by the clause are proportional, balanced and practicable. The honest, reasonably diligent director has nothing to fear. The amendments are undesirable both in that they would remove the need for the explicit statement in the directors' report and because they would limit the requirements on directors. That is not necessary, for the reasons I have given. The effect <P>


<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is likely to be a Bill with less effective provisions. For that reason, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I am not sure that this is the appropriate time for me to intervene in this matter; it may be better on later amendments. As a non-accountant, I hesitate to embark in a debate on these matters, but I have been a non-executive director of a number of companies for some time. I have some concerns about the overall impact of the clause. We shall turn to the references to "reasonable" and "ought to know" later, but they are highly relevant.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para10"></a>I noted that the Minister referred to the fact that a reasonably diligent director has nothing to fear. I like to feel that I am a reasonably diligent director and I certainly have no intention of letting directors off the hook. I should like to explain from where my worries about how this is put together come. I start from the view that I am finding it increasingly difficult to recruit extremely good people to be non-executive directors, particularly for companies that are in regulated industries.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para11"></a>The risk/reward ratio has undoubtedly altered over recent years. The amount of work involved has increased considerably. Therefore, the amount of time that a director has to take, particularly if he is on the audit committee, is now quite substantial and, undoubtedly, has put a lot of people off wishing to do it. My concern is that these issues are exacerbated by parts of this clause. I am not yet reassured by the Minister that I am wrong. I hope that he will be able to do so.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para12"></a>My main concern is that the phrase "ought to know"&#151;"reasonable" is another issue&#151;seems to apply as equally to the non-executive directors as to the finance director. As a non-executive director with an inevitably limited amount of time to spend on the company's affairs&#151;and I spend a great deal of time on audit committees already&#151;am I expected to delve even further to establish what I ought to know? I am certainly concerned that everything I know should be revealed to the auditors, but I do not know how I will actually know what I "ought to know". I am certainly not in the same position as a finance director, on whom I rely very considerably in these matters.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para13"></a>Even if the non-executive director has the knowledge, skill and experience, I doubt whether he will have the time or scope to delve into all the details in an audit report&#151;they are now voluminous&#151;to ensure that he has not missed something which he ought not to have missed. I am therefore concerned about the introduction of "ought to know". Inevitably, a non-executive director relies very considerably on the executive directors and, in large companies, cannot get round the whole company.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para14"></a>"Reasonable" is another issue. I am not clear what would be "reasonable". It is clear that, as the Minister says, one would be dependent on the courts in any particular case. However, with the introduction of "ought to know", I have a fear that many people will feel that they do not want to embark on this risk, because <P>


<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they do not want to find themselves spending a long time in a court establishing the "reasonable" position that they have.
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para15"></a>I am also not clear what Clause 234ZA(3) actually means. It refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by the director in relation to the company",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-14_para16"></a>
and to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the knowledge, skill and experience that the director has".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-14_para17"></a>
In terms of the Smith report, we are now seeking to recruit finance directors and accountants&#151;the former senior partners of accountancy firms&#151;to join and chair the audit committee. Is there not a risk that, in this context, it depends what "knowledge, skills and experience" means? Does it mean that a much lesser test will be applied to those who do not have that knowledge and are not accountants, than to the non-executive director who has accountancy skills?
<P>

<a name="40317-14_para18"></a>I can see that we are trying to recruit people from a much wider range for non-executive directors, but is that the implication? It would mean that it would be more difficult to recruit non-executive directors who are accountants and finance directors and whom one wants to get on to the audit committee. So I have a number of concerns about this. I hope that I am wrong in my interpretation, but my fear is that it will become more difficult to persuade people to take on these tasks if this clause is phrased in exactly the way it is now.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Perhaps I may echo the points just made by my noble friend Lord MacGregor. The clause is particularly worrying because of the way in which the actions or non-actions of other directors are brought within the scope. We will come on to discuss what one ought to know and what is reasonable. In a sense, however, we cannot conclude the discussion on this group of amendments until we have had discussions on the other amendments.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para0"></a>One point is very clear to me. Overall, this clause is bringing in the benefit of hindsight in a context in which the specific duties are not well understood or codified. The concept of different standards for different functions of directors is a very novel one. We are not only going into the territory of liability attaching to the individual director, with all the difficulties expressed by my noble friend; we are effectively picking up the liability for all other directors. That is what many of those I have spoken to are particularly worried about.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para1"></a>The benefit of hindsight is a wonderful thing. The people I have been speaking to recently have been appalled, for example, at the way in which non-executive directors at Equitable have been castigated for what they did. I do not want to discuss the substance of that, but it is very clear that the benefit of hindsight has been used extensively there. The concern is that the benefit of hindsight would be used, not only to damn one's own activities but also to damn one in relation to everybody else's activities.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para2"></a>The whole clause, and the individual points that we shall be debating over the next few groups, raise very significant issues. I believe that the provisions will <P>


<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>significantly impair the pool of those willing to undertake roles in relation to non-executives, and particularly in relation to the audit committee, to which I understood that the Government were firmly committed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble friend the Minister answers the long list of questions&#151;and without trespassing on the amendments that are to come, which is very difficult in the present discussion&#151;does he recognise that the introduction of the objective standard of care, skill and diligence is one of the most important provisions in the Bill? Of course, every time a duty of skill and care or indeed any other duty is introduced by legislation, people want to know&#151;I was about to say, what non-lawyers want to know, but sometimes lawyers engage in it&#151;precisely what facts will give rise to liability. Of course, no one can answer that.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para3"></a>What a person ought to know depends on the facts. My noble friend is not being asked questions of law, which is what legislation is about. He is being asked questions of fact. What a non-executive director or a finance director should know is defined as far as the law can possibly do it. In Section 234ZA(3), he must have the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the . . .  functions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-15_para4"></a>
If he has special knowledge, skill and experience, he will of course by judged by them.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para5"></a>No doctor would expect any further definition of his legal standard of skill and care. He would know that when he went before the General Medical Council, or some such body, the question of facts&#151;of whether he had operated at a reasonable standard of medical care&#151;would be judged. But no statute can answer that. I hope that my noble friend will not be led into trying to define the types of fact that could give rise to liability, which would be quite impossible for a statute to do, and is something that a statute should not be expected to do.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para6"></a>The substitution of a positive objective standard of care for directors is of course one of the most important recommendations in the Company Law Review reports. The 19th century subjective approach, to which we shall come in later amendments, is now being overtaken. Those who are used to having their standards of skill and care judged by what they happen to know and think in a subjective way will of course complain about that&#151;unless, perhaps, they reflect that it is time that British business had standards of skill and care in the boardroom that the reasonable man on the Clapham omnibus and the reasonable doctor would expect to have applied to him. They might understand that there is now going to be a reasonable man in the Clapham taxi cab.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Perhaps I may develop that argument with the noble Lord. He talks about reasonable care&#151;for example, the reasonable care and skill of a doctor. Does the noble Lord think that it is reasonable that, say, a doctor in a team of surgeons <P>


<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be held in some way responsible for the standards of care adopted by other members of the team? In effect, that is what this clause attempts to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   With great respect, the noble Baroness is going back to our previous discussion. I disagreed with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that this clause, as a whole, imposes a kind of "pudding" of liability on the entire directorate for any fault in any single director. I do not think that is what the clause means at all. I very much hope that my noble friend will repeat that that is not what it says. That is a total misunderstanding of the clause. That is what we discussed just now.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para7"></a>Now, we are discussing the point raised by the noble Lord about the actual standard of what the director will be liable for in terms of a duty of skill and care under subsection (3) of new Section 234ZA. In that respect, I again hope that my noble friend will not be led into defining every possible situation of fact that could possibly give rise to liability. The definition is clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn for making those points. We agree with him. This has been an interesting but difficult discussion which has looked ahead to a number of proposed amendments. We shall return to "ought to know" and such issues later.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para8"></a>I turn now to the problem of the non-executive director. Having spent most of my working life as director of a company, I am very interested&#151;as are other noble Lords&#151;in the implications of this clause. I talked to a number of people in the accountancy world and to various head-hunters. The general view is that this Bill is trying to improve the standards of audit in the UK. In doing so, the standard of the non-executive needs to be improved. Although there are some extraordinarily able non-executive directors, as we know, the position of non-executive director has been the sort of job that one could get on retirement. It was a rather comfortable job for a few hours a week, with a small amount of money. I can see heads being shaken, but I can point to a number of companies where that is the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for taking the intervention. The noble Lord is repeating stereotypical views from another era. I do not know which head-hunters he has been talking to recently, but I could take him to the leading head-hunters of today who, frankly, would find that deeply insulting in relation to the work that they carry out in placing individuals on boards. It is also deeply insulting to the vast majority of non-executive directors in British business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I think that I am being misunderstood. I talked about the traditional non-executive director, for a number of whom the stereotype is correct. I spoke to two senior, well-established head-hunters who are delighted that the standard of non-executive directors to be appointed will be raised by the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_GC106"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para9"></a>In the company I chaired for many years, the non-executive director was, and is the managing partner in a large firm of accountants. I asked him, "Will this result in a change in your attitude to being a non-executive director in this company?". He said, "Yes, it will and I am delighted that it will. I will now have to take an even greater interest in the company's activities". He saw it as a positive rather than a negative. Therefore, I am not as worried as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, about the problem of recruiting non-executive directors. It is right and important to impose on them a level of professionalism, which most of them have already.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I do not recognise the kind of non-executive director to which the Minister refers in terms of the new non-executive directors coming forward. The world has changed very considerably in the past 10 years&#151;well before the Higgs report, which is making it change even more. Certainly I find that, in nomination committees now, most boards are seeking to appoint people not because of who they know, or anything like that, but because of the skills and experience they can bring to bear. My one concern is to make sure that we get the balance right and that we do not go too far and discourage those kind of people from continuing to perform the role.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I accept that point. However, I return to a point I made earlier: that the two senior head-hunters to whom I have spoken about this issue do not think that this clause will be a disincentive to people who wish to be non-executive directors.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para10"></a>We shall come on to many of the issues raised but perhaps I may make two important points arising out of the discussion. In spite of what I have said, the Government are aware of the concerns in relation to the recruitment of able non-executive directors. We have recently consulted on directors' liability and are considering the responses carefully. The consultation directly addressed the position of the non-executive director.
<P>

<a name="40317-15_para11"></a>In addition, a point was made about one director picking up the liabilities of other directors. This will not be the case.

<A NAME="40317-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, will he not join me in a general rejoicing at the description given by noble Lords of very great experience in these matters? They have described non-executive directors who will not have much difficulty in complying with the standards the Government are rightly setting down.

<P>

<A NAME="40317-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I thank my noble friend Lord Wedderburn for his support. What he says is the absolute logic. If professional standards are improved by the Bill, what problem is there?

<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   We have had an interesting debate on this group of amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para0"></a>I take issue with my noble friend Lord MacGregor on only one matter. He said that we could end up spending a long time in court. For most non-executive directors or directors, the issue is not so much the long time in court but the long time spent preparing to go to court. The court process is quite easy, but you can wait two or three years while preparing to go to court. That is a time of agonising suspense and it can damage your reputation. Your professional career cannot develop in any way because of the matter hanging over you.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, encouraged the Government on the issue of depending on the facts. I understand his point. But the noble Lord should know that the reality out there is that people say, "If I am going to take on this non-executive role, what are the risks and what are my chances?". They are entitled to ask for some assessment of those issues if they are going to take on the task. Trying to define it may not be attractive but, if we are to encourage good quality people to come forward, they will want to know the "risk for reward" ratio&#151;not so much in terms of money but in terms of reputation&#151;that goes with a task such as this.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para2"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for trying to cover some of the points. I entirely accept his point about directors who behave capriciously and knowingly allow matters to go through when they know that their fellow directors have not acted responsibly. Capricious behaviour is unacceptable&#151;I take that as a very fair point&#151;but I was not absolutely clear about the degree of responsibility that one director will take for another. George Bompas, a legal expert, states that it is very considerable. The Bill as presently drafted will mean that it is a joint and several liability. If someone on the board withholds something without telling you about it, you will be in dire straits. That is his view.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para3"></a>I should like to read what the Minister said, take into account the other points made in the debate and consult further. I shall then, quite likely, come back and readdress the issue. This is a serious and important matter and we share the Government's desire to have the highest quality people serving as non-executive directors. We have had a good preliminary canter over the ground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I do not wish to delay matters, but I wonder whether the noble Lord can help us. This is a very important point in the discussion more generally. The legal advice that he obtained is that there is a general joint or collective liability somewhere in the clause. Can he tell me on which part of the clause his legal advice is based?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   As I understand it, it is in lines 38 and 39. The failure to take "reasonable steps" imposes a severe duty on the directors as a body to ensure that all directors have complied. "Reasonable steps" will include steps to ensure that one's fellow directors have done it. Although a large board may be composed of 15 or 20 people, "reasonable steps" would require that to happen.

<a name="40317-16_para4"></a>As I said, I do not wish to cross swords with the noble Lord on the finer points of law. I am in danger of repeating what I have been told; however, that is what I have been told.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Before we move on, it may be helpful to the Committee if I say a word about joint and several liability so that it is in the record for the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson to read, along with everything else.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para5"></a>The offence in new Section 234(7) applies to every director to whom paragraphs (a) and (b) in that subsection apply. Accordingly, just because one director commits an offence under new Section 234(7), it does not necessarily mean that the offence is committed by all of the directors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for reading that into the record. It will indeed illuminate our thinking. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 46:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 27, leave out "statement" and insert "statements"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40317-16_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 46, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 47, 49, 50, 51, 54 and 65, which stand in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. We are seeking to amend Clause 9 of the Bill. As we know, this clause seeks to establish the obligation of directors to disclose information of which they should be aware. A statement is to be provided in line with the requirements of the clause. We seek to take these requirements further, particularly in our new clause set out in Amendment No. 65.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para9"></a>Subsection (3) of our new clause specifies that a statement must be made stating whether all of the meetings of the remuneration or other committees concerned with directors' remuneration were attended by social partner representatives. We further define what is meant by "social partner representatives". It means representatives of the employees of the company appointed or elected in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State and having the rights and capacities set out in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para10"></a>Why are we making these proposals? In recent years there has been much talk of "fat cats". One of my noble friends&#151;sadly no longer with us&#151;Lord Dormand of Easington, used regularly to table Questions to HMG, drawing attention to the astonishing increases in pay and benefits of senior executives in companies&#151;payouts which took place even when the company itself was not doing very well and workers were facing redundancies. He was usually told by the Minister that this was not a matter for legislative intervention. However, it is increasingly a matter of concern, not only in this country but also in the United States. American lawyers have begun to call it "rent extraction" by the top managerial elite. In Britain the process began in the 1980s, but the big take-off in directors' rewards took place in the 1990s. Between <P>


<a name="column_GC109"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1994 and 2000, the median annual salary and bonus for the highest paid British directors increased by 107 per cent, while the median increase for employees in the same companies rose by 31 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para11"></a>In 2001 there was another dramatic upward shift in directors' pay. Indeed, in the 10 years to 2003, the average rewards for chief executives in British boardrooms rose by 288 per cent when workers' average salaries grew by 45 per cent. Share options and long-term incentive schemes added incrementally to salary increases. Beyond share options were bonuses, incentive plans and, even further, pension plans. A House of Commons Select Committee reported in 2002 that massive payments for termination of contracts were not in any way justified or required. The Secretary of State, Patricia Hewitt, criticised management for rewarding itself massive pension entitlement increases, about which she said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"they were feathering their own pensions nests while slashing the pension security of their workforce".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para12"></a>
Often there are other benefits such as cars, chauffeurs, enormous housing relocation allowances and so on.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para13"></a>This new phenomenon is not just a cause for envy, as has sometimes been said. It is socially divisive. Society has become relatively more unequal over recent years. The differential between executive pay and ordinary workers' pay has been growing and is still increasing. Productivity in Britain is still flagging and workers and their unions are complaining. Unions contrast the &#163;9.2 million reward of a CEO with a low-paid worker's &#163;10,500 year&#151;and less for women. The Times referred to the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"seemingly unstoppable rise in executive pay and pay-offs for dismal performance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para14"></a>
Quite why all this was not confronted by the Company Law Review is rather surprising.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para15"></a>There are some restraints, such as independent non-executive directors to act as monitors. Indeed, we have been talking recently about non-executive directors. There is more disclosure, some shareholder activism, new shareholders' rights to pass an "advisory" resolution, but "rent extraction" continues to rise. I expect that in response to the amendment we shall be told about the existing restraints. However, it seemed to me and to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn that there is good reason to look at all this again and to consider what further steps might reasonably be taken. So we ask, not for the first time: "What about the workers?". Our amendment seeks to involve the workforces through their representatives. I emphasise that this is TUC policy and has been, I understand, since 1995.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para16"></a>I must stress that this is not an attempt to return to the 1970s and the discussions we had then about the Bullock report. We are not seeking a version of the German "Mitbestimmung"&#151;co-determination&#151;although many years ago when I was a union official I spent some time in Germany looking at the way it worked over there and was quite impressed. This is a different approach. We are seeking involvement in the area of remuneration where the workers would have a legitimate interest.

<a name="40317-16_para17"></a>In the UK, there has been much emphasis on the need for greater shareholder involvement, and that has had some limited results. However, I shall quote a US academic on the matter of co-determination&#151;it is one that I like&#151;who says that,
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para19"></a>On the agenda for reform should be the right of workers to have a voice in the machinery of the company regarding the development of managerial "rent extraction". It is getting out of control and is not being reached by the traditional methods of monitoring or external consultation. In 2001, when the value of their companies fell by 16 per cent, executives in top British companies increased their salaries by 12 per cent and bonuses by 34 per cent. The time has come for a new approach, and hence the amendment. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend on these amendments, to which I have attached my name. I speak in particular to Amendment No. 65, which sets out the meat of the matter.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para20"></a>It has only recently occurred to me that we have been prompted to introduce this perhaps somewhat unusual subject into the Bill, representing only a small morsel of company law reform, because of the slow pace of company law reform in general. I look forward to the day when the Minister presides over a big companies Bill, one brought forward in 2005, 2006 or 2007&#151;no doubt he will still be in office&#151;but so many matters are now urgent in company law reform that some have now overtaken the Company Law Review. That is one reason for initiating a debate via this Bill by tabling these amendments, in particular Amendment No. 65.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para21"></a>There is no doubt about the facts. Survey after survey has shown that, over the past decade or so, the mark of the modern elite of executives in large companies&#151;international and trans-national groups, as well as large domestic enterprises&#151;is an escalating rate of overall reward of a kind which my noble friend said is very socially divisive and difficult to justify.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para22"></a>Of course I appreciate that we have not reached the position of the United States, with its very different culture and, in many ways, its very different form of capitalism, where a few years ago John Kenneth Galbraith was able to describe the pay of a chief executive officer of a large corporation as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not so much a reward for achievement as a warm, personal gesture by the individual to himself".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para23"></a>
But we are rapidly approaching the point where some overall rewards give rise to the same criticism. Moreover, research has shown that the problem of excessive executive reward is not, as many analysts have thought for some years, merely a phenomenon of Anglo-American dispersed shareholder capitalism with the so-called "divorce"&#151;the separation of ownership and control. Evidence is emerging from <P>


<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>France, the Netherlands and Germany, not least in the trial of Mr Ackermann, that this problem has surfaced even in those varieties of capitalism&#151;as the literature has it&#151;which are not usually designated as part of the dispersed shareholding phenomenon as evinced in our system.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para24"></a>This led the trades union movements in Britain, Germany and Holland, the TUC, DGD and FNV, to make in May 2003 a joint statement to the European Commission and the governments of their respective countries stating:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Excessive executive pay is now an issue pressing at the very heart of European capitalism. [These] decisions can only be prepared in relevant subcommittees when employees' representatives are involved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para25"></a>
I shall not try to repeat any of the other evidence on the matter of excessive executive pay because I promised my noble friend at the Dispatch Box that I would deposit a much longer paper on the matter in the Library. I shall do so and send him a copy. However, the evidence is overwhelming that directors are benefiting from salaries, stock options, incentive plans and a vast range of other benefits including, as the TUC pointed out only last week, enormous pension entitlements. Even the Secretary of State, who is not given to Bolshevik statements, recently criticised directors for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"feathering their own pensions nests while slashing the pension security of their workforce".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para26"></a><P>

<a name="40317-16_para27"></a>The Company Law Review did not face up squarely to this new phenomenon, one that has taken on a new qualitative characteristic since 1990. One of its members, Professor Davies, of London University, has stated in one publication that it did not discuss directors' remuneration fully because the Government had the matter under review which,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in effect excluded [the Review] from looking into the matter".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para28"></a><P>

<a name="40317-16_para29"></a>I do not suggest in any way that there is a national or indeed international conspiracy of directors, executive or non-executive&#151;such discussions are silly&#151;but directors do sit on one another's remuneration committees and a leading fund manager commented, quite rightly, last year that whatever the performance figures of companies,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"directors are deciding their own pay. They sit on each other's boards . . .  they are pushing only one way".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para30"></a>
The curve goes on going up. It is all very well for the Government to say that it is a problem of rewards for failure. We are not concerned merely with rewards for failure of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Simpson, was found to exemplify at Marconi. We have had enough of them. The Government have no answer to that, and they certainly have no answer to the real problem of overall excessive reward.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para31"></a>In my own research I have been very interested to find out how much evidence there is of persons leaving the board of directors to become consultants because in that way they avoid disclosure. The Minister looks interested. I am very glad about that. It is impossible to deal with the conventional answers to the problem in the scope of the few minutes available. Disclosure is arguably as much about encouraging competition to be in the top quartile of peers as it is about anything else.
<P>


<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para32"></a>Ministers have enjoyed a luxury of hope over experience on shareholder activism for many years. Mr Stephen Byers, when he was the Minister in 1999, said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we are seeing the beginning of the shareholder activism that exists in the United States".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-16_para33"></a>
I do not know what comparative travails he had but we have certainly not seen anything of the kind, and naturally so. Apart from rewards for failure, shareholder activism and the right to move advisory resolutions are manifestly unlikely to be a method of curtailing excessive reward, as many academic writers have shown in the past 15 years. Nor, for many reasons, are institutional investors necessarily suited to that task. Although in certain situations they have an interest in looking at the matter critically, their main duties are to their beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para34"></a>As to the fashionable solution of independent non-executive directors, I understand the problem of getting such directors to fulfil the tasks that they ought to fulfil. As one American writer put it, the board of Enron was a splendid board, with 14 members and only two insiders; all the rest were independent non-executive directors. You could hardly expect the independent non-executives to form a wall against the remuneration committee structure as it stands.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para35"></a>It was with some prescience that the Trades Union Congress, in its evidence to the Greenbury committee, said that there was one constituency, largely unrecognised by British company law, that offers an untapped resource in introducing a pressure of a countervailing kind&#151;that is, employees, whose lives are as much bound up, if not more so, as stakeholders within the enterprise, as my noble friend has said. For many years the programme of the TUC has been that employees should be represented on remuneration committees, at least to the extent of having a voice. It is a voice that the amendment calls for. So far as anyone can discover, it is not clear what the response of the Department for Trade and Industry has been to this call, which has been repeated many times since 1995. There does not appear to be an official response. I am not asking the Minister for a definitive response today&#151;I hope that he does not give it, as I fear that it might be the wrong one&#151;but one would have expected some response to this very modest suggestion.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para36"></a>That is especially so when, 20 miles across the Channel, workers send representatives from the comite d'entreprise to attend both shareholders' and directors' meetings of large companies. They have the right to all the documents of those meetings and to appoint experts to examine them. They have a voice. Twenty miles is not a long distance, but it could be the planet Pluto so far as British company law is concerned. The Company Law Review Group and the Government even want to abolish Section 309, where employees' interests are recognised.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para37"></a>We cannot possibly have a full debate on the matter today. Our amendments rest on a very conventional device; they say that one must tell the auditors whether one has had representatives of employees involved in the process of discussing the overall reward of directors. I remember the Minister saying many times <P>


<a name="column_GC113"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the important thing is to get the contractual arrangements right. I cannot think of a better group who might help to get the contractual arrangements right than representatives of the employees, who might take a more general view of reward in a corporate enterprise. Behind that, we have traditional machinery that says, like the Combined Code does, "comply or explain"&#151;if one has not had such representatives, explain why not.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para38"></a>A Grand Committee is not a very suitable cockpit for prolonged discussion of such a fundamental theme. Whether we should entice a wider audience to debate the matter on Report will depend very much on what the Minister says. I hope that now or on a future occasion some answer can be given of a reasoned kind, not merely one that says that employees have no place, when the conventional wisdom of the Government is that they are partners in the enterprise. Partners would like a voice on what is being taken out and on what my noble friend has called, using the Americanism, "rent extraction".
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para39"></a>Although I agree that these amendments are somewhat odd in this Bill, I hope that they will be taken as a serious attempt to stimulate a debate about a proposition that is as modest as it is sensible.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-16_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, have enjoyed talking about excessive executive pay. I do not wish to get into a debate on whether pay for executives is excessive, but they may be slightly out of date on what happens in remuneration committees. It is not a case of people sitting on each other's committee and conspiring to pay them ever-large amounts. In my experience, committees have a genuine desire to ensure that executives are remunerated for what they do and are not remunerated for what they do not do. Over the past couple of years, we have seen very significant changes in the boundaries of what is the correct remuneration for that.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para40"></a>I wish not to debate excessive pay, but to put a specific question to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. What would the people to whom the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, referred as "workers" do on the remuneration committee? I resent slightly the term "workers", because in my experience the executive directors about whom we are talking are the ones who have no regard to the Working Time Directive. They are very hard workers for the companies of which they are directors. I struggle to see what would be added by getting one or more workers on to a remuneration committee, when very technical issues about the design of long-term incentive plans are discussed and a detailed appraisal is carried out of the market in which we are trying to set pay.
<P>

<a name="40317-16_para41"></a>As I understand the amendment, these individuals will simply,
<P>

It does not say whether they would have any voting power at the meetings in determining the recommendations from the remuneration committee to the board. It is the board that makes the decisions. I am struggling to understand the practical effect of the amendment, although I concede that it has provided an excellent opportunity for noble Lords opposite to have a little rant about executive pay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, about the importance of company law review. On these Benches, we are entirely with him on that. It came up at Second Reading and in Grand Committee. I am sure that the issue will come up again. All power to his elbow in that regard in persuading the Secretary of State to move it up the agenda.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para0"></a>The noble Lord will be less surprised that we, on these Benches, cannot support the extension of mandatory employee involvement to these new areas. That is not to argue that there have not been unacceptable cases of executive pay; there have. All one can say is that those cases have been given a lot of publicity. Perhaps less publicity has been given to the many, many cases where pay is reasonable, rewards are properly earned, and so forth. Of course, big news stories are about the bad things that have happened.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para1"></a>From our point of view, the present legislation&#151;the companies Acts and so forth&#151;provides more than sufficient statutory provision in that area. As in so many of the issues that we have been talking about during this Bill, the key is the question of disclosure; that is, the voice that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, talks about. Disclosure gives the voice to the shareholders. Shareholder power has greatly increased in recent years, as, again, we have seen in the newspapers, encouraged by various interests and pressure groups that now professionally advise shareholders on their rights and on the suitability and compliance that is being achieved. "Comply or explain": a body should provide that all the time.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para2"></a>As we have already said, we are increasing the director's liability with the addition of the report under Clause 9. A further report that the directors will be required to approve is another increase in their liability. As my noble friend Lady Noakes said, we are seeking ways to encourage good quality people to serve as non-executive directors. This will not be an incentive for them to do so. Therefore, we cannot support this group of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I, too, express my sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said about company law review. In this context, it is particularly important. Clearly, the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, seek to raise an issue about which they feel very strongly. I feel strongly that this is the wrong place. The Bill is about auditing. Whether or not one agrees with the thrust behind the amendment, the issue is about worker or employee participation in the overall direction of the enterprise. It should not be restricted merely to attendance at a remuneration committee. In my view, that is the wrong structural approach.

<a name="40317-17_para3"></a>One may or may not agree with employee participation; I think that there are very good ways of dealing with it. But if one is arguing for employee participation, it is not right to incorporate it into a sub-committee of the board. The reason that we have such difficulty is that in this country we do not have the overall reconsideration of corporate legislation. As I said at Second Reading, we are dealing with company law that is 50 years old. The nature of the corporate enterprise and the corporate endeavour has moved on in those 50 years. There are different views now about what is needed for the overall governance of the enterprise. The right way to deal with these issues is through a fundamental restructuring of company law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I very much appreciate what he has said. What falls from his Benches is of course of particular importance in these matters. I was about to ask whether the noble Lord would give us marks for managing to get our amendments within the Long Title of the Bill, but I shall refrain from that.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para4"></a>Although the noble Lord and I no doubt differ as to whether this is a proper matter to discuss with the Bill, did I understand him to say that a stakeholder approach of some kind is more appropriate to modern corporate law than the old-fashioned approach, which unhappily has dominated the company law review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   We shall come later to an amendment that I have tabled which deals with social and environmental reporting. It will demonstrate that it is not different but has similar factors; it reflects the way in which the view of the enterprise has moved.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para5"></a>Perhaps I did not make myself clear. In my view, the nature of the enterprise and society's view of it has changed and developed in the 50 years since the law under which we now operate as corporations was first put on the statute book. We need a comprehensive review of company law to reflect those changes. We should be debating how, why, where and when the various developments and changes should be incorporated into the new company law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am pleased that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is looking forward to the day when I will bring forward a new companies Act. My personal view is that I hope I will have been sacked or some other act of God will have intervened before such a happy occasion takes place.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para6"></a>I am not at all surprised that the noble Lord has managed, very cleverly, to introduce these amendments to the Bill because he is extremely adept at legal matters. However, I am slightly surprised that he has any doubts about what the Government's response will be because we have consistently put forward our view on these particular issues.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para7"></a>Let me explain our position. This group of amendments deals with employee involvement in company discussions involving the disclosure of the remuneration of the directors of a company and the reporting of that involvement. Amendments Nos. 46, 47, 49, 50, 51 and 54 are consequential to Amendment No. 65 which contains <P>


<a name="column_GC116"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the main provisions. This amendment requires the Government to legislate to create the legal right for two or more employee representatives to attend any committee or other group within the company which discusses the disclosure of directors' pay in relation to Schedule 6 or Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para8"></a>The Government have consistently made it clear that directors' pay is a matter for companies and their shareholders under UK corporate governance structures. It is for companies and their shareholders to decide on the nature and extent of any consultation with employees or their representatives. Nevertheless it is clear that directors face a conflict of interest in the setting of their remuneration, which is why the Financial Reporting Council's Combined Code on Corporate Governance includes a number of principles and provisions in this area.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para9"></a>The revised Combined Code was introduced for listed companies with financial years ending on or after 1 November 2003. The code was developed following the recommendation of Derek Higgs's review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors and is the result of extensive consultation. Code main principle B.2 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no director should be involved in deciding his or her own remuneration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-17_para10"></a>
Code supporting principle B.2 states that the chairman of the board should ensure that the company maintains contact as required with its principal shareholders about remuneration. Code provision B.2.1 states that the board should establish a remuneration committee of at least three members, who should all be independent non-executive directors. The definition of "independent" given at code provision A.3.1 specifically excludes directors who have been employees of the company within the last five years.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para11"></a>The Government fully support the operation of the Combined Code and the key role that it plays in UK company law and the corporate governance framework. The amendment is in accordance with neither the overall approach of enlightened shareholder value taken by the Company Law Review, nor the principles and provisions of the Combined Code.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para12"></a>The Government strongly support the general principle of employee involvement in the workplace. Employees should have the chance to be informed and consulted on management decisions affecting their future. That is why we are committed to a full implementation of the EU directive on informing and consulting employees. The implementing legislation will come into force next year. That follows extensive consultation with stakeholders representing the interests of employers and employees. Indeed, noble Lords will have the opportunity to debate the issue of employee consultation as part of their scrutiny of the employment Bill, which includes a power to introduce the information and consultation legislation.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para13"></a>The draft regulations published for consultation last year were based on a framework agreed with both the CBI and the TUC. It is an approach designed to promote better workplaces and more committed staff. <P>


<a name="column_GC117"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It provides plenty of opportunity for management and employee representatives to reach agreement on the precise nature of the information and consultation arrangements and the topics for discussion.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para14"></a>I shall now deal with remuneration of directors, as I want to make it clear that the Government share the genuine investor concern about the need for proper accountability, transparency and performance linkage in directors' pay. We remain concerned that there should be a very clear link between directors' pay, the remuneration market and performance. There should also be control by shareholders. If we look at the total amount and the speed of the increases in recent years, it is not always clear that the remuneration of directors is either linked to performance or the market, or controlled by shareholders.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para15"></a>We continue on those grounds to be concerned about what has happened with directors' pay. That is why the Government have taken significant action in the area over the past two years. In August 2002, the Government introduced the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations. Those require quoted companies to produce a detailed annual directors' remuneration report which is put to a shareholder vote at each annual general meeting. I do not agree totally with the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that that is obviously not effective. Directors are very concerned that such matters should be voted on at annual general meetings, and that will begin to show results. We need to see those results coming through as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para16"></a>The UK now has a comprehensive, transparent and accountable framework for directors' pay which surpasses other corporate governance regimes in similar market economies. But that latest legislation has been in place for only one full financial year, and more time must be given for it to take full effect.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para17"></a>In addition the Government have recently consulted on the specific issue of "rewards for failure". That took place in response to continuing investor concern about situations where directors leave companies which have performed poorly but receive excessive compensation packages when their contracts are terminated. The Government's response to that consultation was announced by a Written Statement on 25 February this year. It included announcing the monitoring of compliance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations, which shows that we are still very much concerned about the issue.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para18"></a>The enlightened shareholder value approach recommended by the Company Law Review states that the primary responsibility for directors is to run the company in the collective best interests of its shareholders. In deciding what will be in those interests, directors must consider all relevant factors. Those include those areas that are important to companies in a modern economy, such as the company's relations with its employees and its need to maintain its business reputation. That ties in with the Company Law Review conclusion that the approach of enlightened shareholder value provides the best conditions for the proper exercise of business judgments in order to achieve the best means of securing overall prosperity and welfare, and that a <P>


<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pluralist model of company law would not be as effective in delivering improved competitiveness and thus the efficient creation of wealth and other benefits.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para19"></a>I should comment on why so long has been taken. The task is, of course, extremely complicated. In seeking to take forward the detailed proposals within the framework of a completely new companies Act, we found that we necessarily had to address questions of how the elements would be built up. In doing so, we are not in any way seeking to depart from those Company Law Review principles, which, as we have said, remain as relevant as ever. However, it is apparent that if, as part of the process, we change the basic concept of our company law, that could have practical consequences on how companies operate that were not explored fully in the Company Law Review. We remain committed to the process and to making proposals, on which we should properly consider such major issues.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para20"></a>We do not think that the amendments are the right way in which to deal with directors' remuneration, but it is an issue that we are keeping under review.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I listened very carefully to what my noble friend said. One advantage of the extraordinary scope of the Department for Trade and Industry is that one can ask the Minister to leap about from the law on employment consultation to company law, and his advisers can cover both areas and, indeed, many others. I would like to ask him two questions.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para21"></a>The Minister mentioned the forthcoming regulations on consultation under the directive, of which the Government kindly provided us with a draft. Did I understand him to say that he expected those regulations to give employees' representatives an opportunity to consult on proposed remuneration and rewards for directors in a company, before they were settled? That was not my understanding of the draft that I saw; no doubt I have not studied it sufficiently carefully. I do not want to ask him for an answer on the hoof, as it were, if he does not want to commit himself on that question, but it is a most important matter in which trade unions are very interested. If he does not want to answer it now, perhaps he could give us further information on the point.
<P>

<a name="40317-17_para22"></a>The Combined Code sets out an approach for remuneration committees. Something that I found in my notes, to which I did not have time to refer, is taken from the annex to the Higgs report, and I think that it is the text in the Combined Code after all the discussions with the Financial Reporting Council. It states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"remuneration committees should be sensitive to broader issues, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group . . .  when determining annual increases",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

of directors' rewards. Does that not indicate that there is a place for input before the matter is settled from employee representatives?

<A NAME="40317-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I certainly did not say that full implementation of the information consultation directive would lead to consultation <P>


<a name="column_GC119"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about directors' pay by the employees. I do not believe that it does, but I will check and, if I am wrong, I will come back to the noble Lord. I am afraid that I did not understand his second point about the reasons for employees being involved. Could he repeat it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I was struck by the phrase, which I believe has survived into the Combined Code, that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"remuneration committees should be sensitive to . . .  pay and employment conditions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-18_para0"></a>
not merely in the company, but in the group. So much of our discussion is about "the company" when we ought to discuss "the group".
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para1"></a>The whole reward structure in an enterprise is of such importance these days. There is a great deal of feeling on the part of workers&#151;I do not exclude directors or anyone else who works for a living from "workers"; I simply talk about those who are employed and not in the higher reaches of management&#151;caused by the fact that excessive rewards have been set so often without regard to the balance in the enterprise between the upper and lower reaches. Many commentators have pointed out how that enormous increase in proportion in the past 10 years, which some people will not take seriously, has become divisive in a new way. If the Combined Code says that remuneration committees must look at pay and employment conditions overall in the company and the group when determining the annual increases at the top, would that not be a good place for those who are very interested in the overall balance of rewards in the enterprise to have a voice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   There is a distinction between what the Combined Code says that the people taking the decisions should bear in mind, and a further argument that suggests that a particular group of people should play a part. Those are two quite different issues. I totally support the first, but my initial arguments suggest that the second is the wrong approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I thank Members of the Committee who have taken part in the debate, which has been very interesting. In particular, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, who at least was sympathetic but thought that the amendment was in the wrong place. I am also glad to learn that the Government have at least some concern about the imbalance in directors' pay. I believe that they still say that companies are controlled by shareholders and that pay is a matter for the company and its shareholders. Nevertheless, the Minister mentioned the concern about rewards for failure, excessive packages for pay and the widening gap between workers in enterprises and very senior management.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para2"></a>We would like to examine what the Minister said very closely. We may want to come back with a rewording on Report, because the issues are sufficiently important for us to have a discussion on the same question then, even though there is a view that our amendment might be better attached to some other legislation. I do not know about that, but the <P>


<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<A NAME="40317-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 55:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-18_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40317-18_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 9 is on the statement in the directors' report. Amendment No. 55 is concerned with proposed new Section 234ZA, which appears at the top of page 12 and is entitled:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Information to have been disclosed to auditors before directors' report approved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-18_para7"></a>
It is a small amendment but nevertheless important. As the Bill is drafted, the new statement in the directors' report requires the inclusion of a statement that, at the time at which the report is approved, there is no information which has not been disclosed to the company's auditors.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para8"></a>That is an extraordinarily wide and far-reaching definition and requirement. In the real world, I suspect that more or less every director of every company could be hung on such a provision. I hope that the Minister will not argue that there is no need to worry about the unamended clause because if the information were not material the courts would not use it. That would be an unsatisfactory reply.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para9"></a>The amendment inserts "material" into proposed new Section 234ZA(1) under Clause 9, ensuring that at the time of the approval of the directors' report there is no "material" information which has not been disclosed to the company's auditors. It offers the Government a helpful alternative approach to our Amendment No. 53, which we discussed earlier. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I do not think that there is a great difference of principle between us here. We are in agreement that we do not want to require the directors to overburden the auditors by providing them with everything they know about the company. Clearly, that would be counter-productive and result in both auditors and directors spending too much time and costs in providing and assessing large amounts of irrelevant information.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para10"></a>However, we do not consider that this amendment is necessary. Subsection (5) of Clause 9 inserts a new Section 234ZA into the 1985 Act. Subsection (2)(b) of that new section restricts the information to which the statement relates to information that the director knows&#151;or ought to know&#151;is relevant for the purposes of the auditor's determination (in accordance with Section 235). In other words, the information must be relevant to the audit opinion; that is, that the accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act, and in particular that they show a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss for the year. We think that that provides the right balance&#151;so that the directors have to provide the <P>


<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information that is of real relevance to the auditor's work, but are able to make the required statement without providing excessive amounts of information.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para11"></a>Nevertheless, a director may say that it is difficult to know what he or she ought to know is relevant for the auditor to reach an opinion. We do not require the directors to put themselves in the position of the auditors. We require them to use a minimum level of common sense which might be expected of a person in their position and to use any particular knowledge they may have.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   The Minister said that the requirement that the director "ought to know" that the information would be relevant is to do with common sense. Is that a definitive explanation of the Government's interpretation of that clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I think this comes back to our earlier discussion when we were talking about the level of expertise of directors who guide the affairs of companies. They are not fools. They are intelligent people, and we require them to use a minimum level of common sense which might be expected of a person in their position. I think that that is a perfectly reasonable part-answer to the issue raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Perhaps I can take that further. We are talking about what is relevant to auditors in terms of the reasonableness of how they perform their functions, not about what directors themselves do. We are talking about the directors needing to understand what is relevant to an auditor. That is why I am struggling in terms of the test for a director when he or she is trying to find out what would be relevant to the auditor. That is why my noble friend's amendment, which refers to the materiality of information, takes us to the heart of how to ensure that directors disclose material matters. It does not mean that directors have to know the mind of the auditor. We will return in a later amendment to the need to know the mind of the auditor. I find it extremely difficult to know how any director, even one with some knowledge of accounting or auditing, would be able to see into the mind of the auditor at any given time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I think that we are going to disagree on this. I return to the earlier point&#151;that we are talking about well-organised, well-structured companies with boards of directors who are aware of the audit process. I would be amazed if directors in the sort of companies we are talking about were not aware of the audit process. They would be aware of the necessary probity for their position and the need to exercise governance. All we are saying is that&#151;returning to an earlier point on which we disagreed&#151;we have a very high regard for those who run these companies and the level of their intelligence. We would expect them to have the common sense to be able to determine for themselves as a board and as individuals what auditors would expect from them.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I have to say that I am disappointed with what the Minister has said. What we are dealing with in new Section 234ZA is a balance of new provisions, to which the noble Lord referred. The phrase "ought to know" has been causing Members on this side of the Grand Committee a lot of concern. One of the ways to lessen our concern about the phrase is to say "no material information" instead of "no information". That would provide some more protection in this balance. I cannot see how the addition of materiality to this new section would weaken the position. It would reassure directors, executive or non-executive, that they cannot be hung on a figment or a small event. As the new section is presently drafted, I think that that could happen.
<P>

<a name="40317-18_para12"></a>The Minister will say that that will not happen in reality. While that is fine to assert when sitting comfortably in the Moses Room on a nice March afternoon, there will be times away from here when people have to face the reality of what we are discussing. To be honest, I do not think that the Minister has mounted a convincing argument to explain why materiality should not be a qualification on information.

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is reasonable to expect a director to enquire about and what is unreasonable is a pretty grey area. It would be helpful if the Minister could enlighten the Committee on the Government's thinking on how this is to be determined. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   Perhaps I may add a word, because earlier I gave the general context in which I approach these matters, and this is a relevant point. The Minister's words have been extremely comforting and soothing: there is no unreasonable requirement; a reasonably diligent director has nothing to fear; a minimum level of common sense. I must say that the phrase, "a minimum level of common sense" was the one that worried me, suggesting as it does that there is no heavy test at all. However, I suspect that when it comes to real issues, the "minimum level of common sense" will be much debated.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para9"></a>This amendment, along with our debate on the words "ought to know", draws attention to the heart of my concern. Let us take, for example, a UK company with a large number of overseas subsidiaries in the Far East, Japan, Australia and the United States. That is not an unusual situation for some of us. Sometimes it is impossible, when an issue arises in an American subsidiary with a different audit, to know as a non-executive exactly what is going on in that area unless it is drawn to one's attention by the executives involved. Taken at face value, it would sound as though a director now in an audit committee should be making all sorts of inquiries over and beyond the papers that are put in front of him, just to be absolutely sure that he is safeguarded against any subsequent attack or litigation.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para10"></a>I wonder again whether the words the Minister is using square with what is in the Bill. That is my concern. If one ought to know what the auditor is seeking and one does not know what is going on in one of the subsidiaries, where does that leave one? That could be an extremely onerous requirement. It is those two provisions, combined together, that lead to my worries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As we have discussed under previous amendments, the statement in the directors' report provided for in this clause is above all a way of focusing the attention of directors on the question of whether relevant information has been disclosed to the auditors. The amendment introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, would remove a detailed provision designed to ensure the effectiveness of Clause 9. We believe that to accept it would weaken the clause significantly.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para11"></a>The amendment concerns new Section 234ZA(2)(a), which states that, in certain circumstances, information may still fall within the scope of the directors' statement when the director is not initially aware of the information but&#151;this is the crucial phrase&#151;it is reasonable for the director,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to obtain the information by making enquiries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-19_para12"></a>
The test here&#151;which brings us on to the foreign subsidiaries&#151;is that if it is impossible to know, then it is not reasonable. If something is happening in a <P>


<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subsidiary in Peru, for example, it is unreasonable to expect the director to know about that. The test is reasonableness.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para13"></a>That is very important because it means that a director cannot say, for example, "I did not know about that particular information concerning the value of the company's stocks, though I know that it was important to the auditors. I also know that Mr X knew all about it, but I never bothered to ask him. However, the test in law is simply whether or not I was aware of the information&#151;and clearly I was not, so I have done nothing wrong". In such a case, we believe that it is reasonable to expect the director to make inquiries.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para14"></a>In other words, the provision in new Section 234ZA(2)(a) is necessary to make this clause effective. But, it is fair to ask, does it impose too uncertain a test on a director? Can it not be argued that what is reasonable to one person is unreasonable to another and that the director does not therefore have enough certainty to know what is and is not unlawful? I do not accept that argument. There is no expectation or implication in the provision that a director needs to make inquiries down every avenue that may yield relevant information. It is only where it is reasonable for the director to do so. We are all used to thinking in terms of what is reasonable. The particular circumstances will determine what is reasonable in each case.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para15"></a>I do not accept that in practice a director will find that difficult to work with. If he or she is uncertain, it must be sensible to discuss the matter with others and get a second opinion on what is reasonable. In the vast majority of circumstances, however, I believe it will be perfectly obvious to the director when it is necessary to make inquiries and when it is not.
<P>

<a name="40317-19_para16"></a>This is not an entirely new and novel approach to the problem that we are now adding to the law. The concept of making reasonable inquiries is used, for example, in Section 80(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which concerns disclosure in listing particulars. I hope that, with my explanation, the noble Lord will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Does not my noble friend also agree that what is much overlooked in these discussions is that subsection (3) makes it perfectly clear that the knowledge that one would expect a "reasonably diligent person" to have must be judged also in relation to the functions fulfilled by a particular director in the corporate enterprise? The test is what is expected of a person carrying out the same functions as carried out by the director in relation to the company.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I agree absolutely with the point made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. In an earlier amendment we made the distinction between <P>


<a name="column_GC125"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what a finance director should know and what a sales director should know. So I agree with my noble friend on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   Can the noble Lord explain why paragraph 48 of the Explanatory Notes states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each director will have to think hard about information, of which he or she is aware but the auditor is not"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40317-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Again that is a perfectly reasonable and sensible proposition for the directors of a company to embrace. We are not dealing with a group of stupid people; we are addressing highly intelligent people who run very successful companies. The line of questioning seems to suggest that they need in some way to be taught how to do their jobs when it comes to governance and probity, and how to recognise audit problems that may emerge within their organisations. I am slightly bewildered by that line of questioning, but that may be my problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I was interested in the noble Lord's reference to making inquiries in relation to listing particulars. I am sure the noble Lord is aware that, when listing particulars are finalised, directors are surrounded by armies of lawyers carrying out detailed due diligence checklists. I should like to explore with the noble Lord whether he thinks that that is the direction of travel for boards of directors and, in particular, for audit committees. Will we end up with a process that involves advisers going through individual items and possible lines of inquiry, checklists of questions to put to the auditors about what they know and do not know, and questions in relation to all the subsidiaries? That is what the analogy to listing particulars implies in practice, although one would not get that from reading the law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   Perhaps I may add a word to what has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I think that it is almost beyond peradventure that we are headed down the route of verification notes as regards information in the directors' report. When we consider what is to come with the OFR, we are headed down the route of verification notes. It is inevitable. However, noble Lords should not take from my remarks that we are doing anything other than providing full employment for the legal profession. I can envisage circumstances in which it will not be possible to hold a board meeting without a lawyer sitting in. We need to understand that, and I think that it should be taken as a given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   When I referred to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, I did so because the concept of making reasonable inquiries is contained in that Act. It was not an analogy; it was simply an example of another Act which uses the same wording. I thought that might be helpful given that there is some surprise and worry about what is meant by "reasonable".

<P>

<a name="40317-20_para0"></a>We are talking about what directors are aware of. If they are not aware there is no responsibility. This point has been made before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   With great respect, that is not what is stated in the text of the Bill. It would help matters greatly if the Minister could confirm the Government's intention in regard to the fact that directors ought to know what the auditors do not know? Is that responsibility&#151;to which my noble friends, with their vast experience, have referred&#151;directed at, for example, the finance director and the audit committee? Can the Minister confirm that it does not apply to non-executive directors and others who do not have direct dealings with the auditors and that there is no intention for them to be caught?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Clause 9(5) makes the situation clear. Subsection (3) of new Section 234ZA states:

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40317-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   Did the Minister say "the same executive or non-executive functions"? That is not in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I added that simply to clarify the position. We are not looking at a difference, as postulated by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, between the non-executive and the executive director.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   From what the Minister has said, and the way I now interpret the clause, it seems to me that we have different levels of responsibility and expertise expected of different directors, be they executive or non-executive, dependent upon their background, skill, knowledge and so on. That introduces a situation which is directly at variance with the situation that has arisen under the Sarbanes-Oxley Bill, where the US approach has been that even the designation of an individual as the financial expert on an audit committee does not attract any greater degree of liability. I can assure the Minister that, if my interpretation is right, there will be no more financial experts on audit committees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble friend replies to that somewhat extraordinary notion, would he reflect on the fact that when a consultant surgeon goes in to operate and the doctors who assist him go in to operate, they expect to operate as reasonably diligent persons, with proper experience and a proper mind to inquire into matters. That does not require them to go into a huddle with lawyers before they perform the operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I am sorry to continue the debate but the point raised by the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Sharman, is one that I raised earlier in relation to subsection (3). I was going to come to it later but, as the noble Lord has raised it, let me deal with it now.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para4"></a>Where one is trying to recruit non-executive directors from a much wider field than normal&#151;from the public sector, from charitable organisations, from minority groups and so on&#151;the knowledge, skill and experience of some of those people would be very small in relation to the issues we are discussing, particularly in relation to audit committees. There would be two classes of people on the audit committee.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para5"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, correctly said, one of the dangers would be that the people with the real knowledge, skill and experience would face problems about making reasonable inquiries, and all of the rest of it. They would have a much higher degree of responsibility than those with no financial experience. If my interpretation, and that of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is correct, it might be quite difficult to attract, as the Government and Smith want, former finance directors and accountants on to the audit committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I return to the example raised before; that is, expertise for particular functions. The distinction between the specialist knowledge that the finance director and the sales director would have was raised. We have to come back to the notion of "reasonableness". Probably, we would not accept that the sales director would have a detailed knowledge of audit procedure. We would expect the finance director to have that. We would not expect the finance director to be able to predict whether a product in stock will sell out within three months, but we would expect the sales director to have that information. The words "awareness" and "reasonableness", when applied, help us with the interesting problem that has been raised.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para6"></a>In other words, what it is reasonable to conclude a finance director ought to know is not the same as what it is reasonable to conclude a non-executive director ought to know. To take a small company, there is a difference between what the director running the business ought to know and what a fellow director who has little active involvement in the business ought to know. I do not think that it is extraordinary that when we hire an expert we should expect expertise. For that reason, and the others that I have given, I think that our approach is the right one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I do not want to prolong the debate, but I should record for today&#151;I am sure that we will be debating this matter again&#151;that what the Minister said has, in effect, sounded the death knell of audit committees being run by those who have expertise in the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am sure that the Minister is under no illusions regarding our concerns about this amendment and the provisions of this clause. What most concerns us about "reasonableness" is reasonableness ex ante and reasonableness ex post. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. "Reasonableness" in <P>


<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>respect of what one should have done, looking back up the track six or eight months, appears incredibly straightforward, but at the time it was not quite as clear.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para7"></a>We have not got a clear guide from the Government on the shifting nature of reasonableness in relation to society or time. For my part, I was slightly further confused by the small and big company example and, indeed, the discussions about expertise. Without wishing to further belabour the Minister, I did not think that the FSMA example was helpful. Listing particulars are about raising money. They are about trying to entice the public to put money into a company. An annual report is reporting what the company has done to shareholders who are already owners of the business. It is a very different function, but we do not need to go any further on that.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para8"></a>Clearly, we shall come back and look at the issues in connection with this clause. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40317-20_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sharman </B>   moved Amendment No. 59:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 13, leave out from "determination" to end of line 15 and insert "of the form of his report under sections 235 and 237 of this Act;"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-20_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40317-20_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: We return, I fear, to subsection (2) of Clause 5. There appears to me to be a technical flaw in this subsection. As currently drafted, it does not fully reflect auditors' duties in regard to their overall reports on financial statements and annual reports. The information disclosed to the auditors before the directors' report is approved under new Section 234ZA(2)(b) should not be restricted to the information required by auditors for the purposes of the auditors' determination in accordance with Section 235 of the 1985 Act, which deals with the preparation of accounts. It needs to be extended to include the information that auditors require to meet their responsibilities under Section 237, which deals with the accounts and other matters on which they have to report in respect of the auditor's report. I should be very grateful if we could clear that up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-20_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We recognise that, as currently drafted, new Section 234ZA(2)(b) does not reflect the full range of material which must be covered in an auditors' report set out in the Companies Act 1985. The reason for this is that the principal purpose behind this clause is to ensure that the auditors have all the information relevant to determining their opinion on the annual accounts; that is, whether the annual accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act, and in particular whether they give a true and fair view.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para13"></a>However, we have some sympathy with the noble Lord's amendment. In particular, I find it difficult to argue why this particular provision should not also refer to information relevant to the determination of the auditor's opinion in relation to the directors' remuneration report, as required by Section 235(4) of <P>


<a name="column_GC129"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the 1985 Act. I am not convinced, however, that we need to include information relevant for all of the auditor's duties under Section 237.
<P>

<a name="40317-20_para14"></a>I therefore hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, will accept my undertaking to look at the point raised by this in more detail and to bring forward an appropriate amendment for consideration at Report stage.

<A NAME="40317-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 60:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 16, leave out "ought to know"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-21_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40317-21_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: We come now to new Section 234ZA(2)(c), after hammering away at subsections (a) and (b). Paragraph (c) introduces yet another complexity that lies at the heart of our differences. We thought very carefully about "ought to know" in connection with subsection (2)(b), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the director knows or ought to know that the information would be relevant for the purposes of the auditors' determination".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-21_para3"></a>
We decided that, on balance, it was fair to leave that in. However, when we got to subsection (2)(c), which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the director knows or ought to know that the auditors are not aware of the information",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-21_para4"></a>
we thought that it was a bridge too far.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para5"></a>The director is in a very difficult position if he is being asked to decide what the auditors ought to know but in fact do not. So we felt that Amendment No. 60 was right to seek to remove "ought to know" from this part of the Bill. We are quite content with the penalty for a director failing to disclose information that he knows is relevant to the audit and where he also knows that the auditors do not know it. However, asking a director to take responsibility for information that he ought to know the auditors do not know is a step too far. It is very difficult to see how a director is to avoid being charged with being reckless in such circumstances, particularly in the modern litigious environment in which we live. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, would, like his earlier Amendment No. 57, remove a detailed provision designed to ensure the effectiveness of Clause 9. Again, we think that this amendment would significantly weaken Clause 9. The provision that Amendment No. 60 would remove introduces the concept of what a director ought to know in relation to what information the auditors are not aware of. Let me explain why I think that necessary to make the clause effective, and why it does not impose an unfair or disproportionate burden on directors.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para6"></a>Without the references to what a director ought to know, we are left with a test which it is very difficult in practice to demonstrate has been met. Whether a director knows that the auditors are not aware of certain information is difficult to prove. A director might say, "I realise that a reasonably diligent person <P>


<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in my situation would have known that the information was not known by the auditors by, for example, checking lists of disclosures that had been made to them. I should have realised that but as a matter of fact I did not". I am clear that the references to "ought to know" and its meaning in proposed new Section 234ZA(3) are necessary to make the clause work effectively.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para7"></a>Again, it is right to consider whether the provision imposes an unfair burden on the director, and again our answer is that it does not. I would have been sympathetic to that concern had we simply included the reference to "ought to know" without further explanation. However, proposed new subsection (3) carefully defines what is meant by "ought to know" in the context.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para8"></a>There are three elements to that. First, the director does not have to be a superman or superwoman; he or she is expected to know only what a reasonably diligent person would know. Secondly, in reaching a view of what a reasonably diligent person would know, the clause does not lump all directors together, but says that it is to be determined in relation to the knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as that director. In other words, what it is reasonable to conclude that a financial director ought to know is not the same as what it is reasonable to conclude that a non-executive director ought to know. That point has been made several times this afternoon. Thirdly, what a reasonably diligent person would know is determined also in relation to the knowledge, skills and experience that the particular director actually has.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para9"></a>Our aim is to produce legislation that is carefully balanced&#151;that will be valuable and effective in supporting the statutory audit but will not impose unreasonable requirements on directors. We believe that the provisions meet those aims. The very first point on the first day&#151;it seems like last week&#151;made by my noble friend Lord Sainsbury was that one of the purposes of Committee is to listen carefully to what everyone says, take it away and consider the discussions and arguments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   What the Minister says is clearly extremely encouraging but, before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment, I want to probe a little more about the practical implications of the paragraph. It suggests that the director knows or ought to know that the auditors are not aware of the information. It contains nothing about being able to rely on reasonably diligent auditors.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para10"></a>What one ought to know that the auditors did not know would be different if one had highly competent auditors or non-competent auditors. The clause is not balanced by any counterbalancing assumption that the director can make, because we are in effect talking about hypotheses that the auditors are acting reasonably. Without some balance, the provision will result in severe practical difficulties for those charged with considering the matter. I shall return to audit <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>committees; I should have declared an interest a long time ago as a chairman and member of a number of them. Such considerations bear heavily on my mind.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para11"></a>I do not know what procedures I would have to undertake to ensure that I knew or ought to know that the auditors were aware of information. I find that particularly difficult to contemplate in the context of what level of skill they are expected to demonstrate in the way in which they conduct their audit. I feel that we are going into unknown territory. To reinforce the point that I made under an earlier amendment, that will make the job of anyone wanting to be involved in an audit committee so undesirable as to set back corporate governance by a decade. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   Before the Minister replies, may I add a brief comment to what my noble friend Lady Noakes has just said? There is a great emphasis at the moment on training or attempting to train non-executive directors in an effort to recruit a higher quality and wider range of directors. Before we come to Report stage, will the Minister reflect on the effect of the provision?
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para12"></a>Unless the Bill is amended, I can tell the Minister that it will have a very serious effect on our ability to recruit more people to serve on boards of public companies. Despite the words of reassurance the Minister has given the Committee, the reality of the situation is that all directors&#151;not only those serving on audit committees, with whom there are separate problems&#151;will have to be warned about their responsibilities. I assure the Minister, from my experience, that that will have a deleterious effect on the legitimate aspirations of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to recruit more experienced directors, including those with perhaps no direct experience of business&#151;those coming from the teaching profession, from quangos or academia, for example. They will be put off by the requirement of "ought to know". I seriously ask the Minister to reflect on that before we come to Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   First, I shall speak to the interesting point made by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, when he asked us to reflect&#151;which, of course, we shall do. I was rather concerned when he said that directors should be warned about their responsibilities. Good Heavens&#151;that is part of the job of being a director!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   I apologise for not making my point crystal clear. In training sessions for non-executive directors&#151;in the excellent courses run by the Institute of Directors, for example&#151;the lecturer will inevitably refer to what is in the Bill. The detailed explanation with which the Minister has favoured the Committee will not, I assure him, be gone into in great detail. The lecturer will quote Section 234ZA(2)(c), and will not necessarily go into the fine detail of all the exceptions and nuances. That is what will put off recruits.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>see the pool of non-executive directors drying up as a result of this Bill becoming an Act, but that is simply a difference of opinion.
<P>

<a name="40317-21_para13"></a>All I would really like to say in relation to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is that she postulates the idea of auditors who are not very good and a board that is not very good. However, what we are doing in the Bill is assuming&#151;I think rightly&#151;that the auditors know, accept and embrace audit standards, and that the board of a company behaves as a board should behave. We are continuing to come back to how we define "reasonableness" and "awareness", how we establish a direct "need to know" in relation to the auditor, and what the auditor needs to know in relation to the board. Those are issues that we have been teasing out this afternoon, and we shall probably continue to tease them out for the next half hour and into Monday. They contribute to words that we shall all be reading over the next week or so.

<P>
<A NAME="40317-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   No, we believe that we have the balance right in this clause, but we will reflect on the points made today. I cannot go any further than that at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that he will reflect on what we have discussed and on the points made. Whoever drafted his speaking note to say that, by removing "ought to know", the amendment would weaken the detailed provisions of the clause is overstating the case. The issue relates to "not", and whether a director ought to know that the auditors are not aware. Proving a negative has always been a very difficult task.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Freeman refers to the issues of attracting non-executive directors. For better or worse, high profile cases where non-executive directors find themselves in the firing line&#151;there will be more if such legislation is enacted&#151;put people off. Perhaps they should not, but they do. I was a director of a hospital company, which employed many nurses and whose essence was to provide people with medical care. We wanted to have on the board a senior nursing sister to provide an aspect of expertise. Before we got to the issues that we are discussing, it was difficult, even under current legislation, to discuss with the nurse, who knew nothing about finance&#151;we asked her to join the board because she was a nurse&#151;what her liabilities were and where her responsibilities began and ended, without what we are proposing here.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para1"></a>On this side of the Committee we thought carefully about subsection (2)(b). Those provisions, which are unamended subject to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, state that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the director knows or ought to know that the information would be relevant for the purposes of the auditors' determination".

<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
That is a positive statement, which is fair enough. However, paragraph (c), which says,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the director knows or ought to know that the auditors are not aware",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-22_para3"></a>
pushes out the provision a bridge too far.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para4"></a>Although we shall withdraw the amendment this afternoon, we shall return to it. I hope that the Minister will give it very sympathetic and serious consideration in the mean time. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40317-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Geddes): </B>  Before calling Amendment No. 61, I must advise the Committee that, if it is agreed to, I cannot call Amendment No. 52 due to pre-emption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 61:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, leave out lines 18 to 24.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-22_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40317-22_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is complicated, but I shall try to deal with it as quickly as possible, in view of the hour. Amendments Nos. 61 and 64 are an attempt to probe into a strange situation that has arisen in regard to directors' duties. With our usual helpful intention, my noble friend and I tabled the amendment with the helpful intention of getting the Minister off a peculiar hook of his own making.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para8"></a>I do not want to revert to previous discussions, but subsection (3), at page 12, lines 18 to 24, introduces an objective standard of the duty of skill, care and negligence on the part of directors. I say at once that that was proposed by the Company Law Review Group, with which I am totally at one on the matter. I therefore approve of the subsection that my amendment curiously purports to leave out. I shall explain why.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para9"></a>I could have done this in a previous century or in previous decades simply by saying that there is applied to professional people a very clear objective standard known under the heading of imperitia culpae adnumeratur. However, I know that today that shall not be enough, so I must explain the issue in longer language, and, as Mr Balfour said once, talking English not law. An accountant is judged by the standards of a reasonable accountant; objectively. A doctor is judged by the standard of a reasonable doctor. A nurse, who has been mentioned, is judged by the standard of reasonable nursing practice. So are all professions. It is directors who have been the exception.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para10"></a>I cannot understand the mystification of those who have vast experience of sitting on boards to be brought face to face with the fact that in new company law directors are to be brought into line with the rest of the law. There will be an objective standard of a reasonably diligent person with the knowledge, skill and experience that is to be expected of a person carrying out those functions. Exactly the same formula could be applied to the doctor, nurse, accountant and solicitor. Some scholars predict that the judges are <P>


<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves about to modify that matter and that there will be litigation&#151;it is afoot already&#151;where some of these questions will be aired. But that is the present position.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para11"></a>Since the Marquis of Bute's case in 1892, the position of the director has been judged on skill and care according to that director's knowledge and that director's experience&#151;largely a subjective matter. The statute has modified it in various situations, such as insolvency, of course. A change is coming to company law.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para12"></a>The difficulty for the Government is that subsection (3) of new Section 234ZA is ahead of the rest of events. The Government have out for consultation a document on director and auditor liability, on which the consultation period ended last Friday. In that document the Government have given a number of options for people to respond to, mainly either the proposal of the Company Law Review to introduce the objective standard or to opt for the disaster of an Americanised business judgment standard, with or without associated principles relating to indemnification and various other matters. I say at once that I can think of no greater disaster for company law than introducing the business judgment standard of the United States state jurisdictions which have adopted it.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para13"></a>I quote from page 20 of the consultative document where it accurately and summarily describes the business judgment rule:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court [under such a judgment rule] will look only to determine whether the directors&#151;at least those directors making the decision&#151;were disinterested in the matter, appropriately informed themselves before deciding, and acted with good faith belief that the decision was in the best interests of the corporation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40317-22_para14"></a>
With the exception, perhaps, of part of the judgment on a duty to inform oneself, that is largely a subjective test, which would be a very backward step.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para15"></a>In fact, much of the argument today has been a subfusc and camouflaged argument in favour of the Americanised business judgment rule. By introducing this clause, the Government have set off what they can expect in the consultation. I very much hope that they will not give way to this pressure. We have even heard that if the same objective standards are introduced for directors as for other professions, they will take away their bat and ball and not sit on these boards at all. I find that quite extraordinary.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para16"></a>In the 21st century, it is clear that the objective standard must be adopted as at least the basis of the new company law. The problem is: where does that leave company law reform in general? Surely it would be better if the objective standard was firmly adopted by a measure of company law reform ahead of the rest of the companies Bill. Why do I say that? I say it because the Bill has introduced the issue. You cannot keep subsection (3) concerning reporting to the auditors and keep the Marquis of Bute's case for the rest. Directors will suffer a kind of schizophrenic attack trying to know what is their standard of care in the one matter and then in the other.
<P>


<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para17"></a>I am serious when I say to my noble friend that the object of this amendment is to ask whether it would be possible to act rapidly on the basis of a consultative document which the Government need now to consider and introduce a measure on directors' duties of skill and care, liability and negligence, as a preliminary reform, thus making some progress on company law generally. Into that, as Amendment No. 64 suggests, subsection (3) would fit very naturally if the objective standard were adopted in accordance with the recommendation of the Company Law Review.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para18"></a>The amendment is an attempt to get my noble friend to say whether, on the enactment of this Bill, we shall be left with an objective standard in one area&#151;covered by new Section 234ZA&#151;and the Marquis of Bute's case in the other. That would be a most undesirable development. Moreover, although I cannot say, the judges may well look at the whole matter again during the next few years. However, the Government should not rely on that, in particular in light of the relationship between some members of the Cabinet and the judiciary. They cannot pull all the chestnuts out of the fire.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para19"></a>I make a serious point in asking whether this subsection does not pre-empt the response to the consultative document that has been issued. Of course I would be quite happy if it pre-empted it and were more general than it is. That is the objective of these probing amendments: to ask for further statements about exactly where the duties of skill and care in general will lie on the enactment of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, on introducing this amendment because it goes to the heart of what we have been discussing over the past hour. I start by confirming to him that I have no problem with an objective standard of measurement of care. My problem is with the notion that the idea of "joint and several", which we have lived with for many years, is now to be replaced by a form of supple proportional liability without actually having the legislative backing for a system of proportional liability. That is what it seems the noble Lord is saying when dealing with terms such as "reasonably", "ought to know" and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para20"></a>I think that those issues of directors' responsibilities and duties of care are inextricably linked to the issue of liability and the consultation which the Government have been undertaking. At Second Reading I asked the Minister whether, if the response to consultation could be handled, it would be possible to table amendments to the Bill latter, either here or in another place, to reflect the outcome of that consultation.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para21"></a>What we are struggling with here is change which will be subtle rather than open, moving away from a situation that is known and understood by members of boards of directors to one where personal, individual responsibility and a proportional sense of duty becomes much more important&#151;without that actually being incorporated in statute so that who ultimately pays whom can be interpreted by the courts. People are <P>


<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not worried about being judged, they are worried about having to pay for something they do not understand or they do not know about.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para22"></a>So I support the notion behind these amendments and look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has brought forward a valuable and interesting initiative. I shall not repeat what he has said but it seems to me that what is proposed in the amendments moves towards an answer to the issues that troubled us so much in our debates on Amendments Nos. 55, 57 and 60.
<P>

<a name="40317-22_para23"></a>The need for clarification is important. Clearly, both sides of the Committee feel that it is critical. A statement outlining the nature of directors' duties has its attractions and I look forward to hearing the Government's thinking on how this may be pushed forward.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040317/text/40317-23.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The essence of the amendments of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is to bring forward a fundamental part of the companies Bill and that somehow this subsection pre-empts that. We take a different view. We see this as an issue that we need to solve. To see this issue&#151;which has to be absolutely central to a companies Bill&#151;as some kind of an adjunct or a separate issue is not the right way to approach the matter.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para0"></a>In effect, the amendments of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn seek to make a connection between the question of what is expected of a director in this relatively narrow context of providing information to the company's auditors and the much broader issue of directors' duties to the company. I think that, despite a superficial similarity, these are two quite distinct issues. The latter&#151;that is, directors' duties to the company&#151;very much belongs in the main companies Bill and not here.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para1"></a>As I said at Second Reading, we are committed to that important reform and we shall publish a draft Bill for comment before we introduce it to Parliament, but it is important to take the necessary time to get it right. We must achieve the delicate task of modernising and simplifying company law while avoiding unintended consequences&#151;in particular, uncertainty&#151;which could damage business and the financial markets.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para2"></a>Amendment No. 61 would remove new Section 234ZA(3), which defines what a director "ought to know" for the purpose of the clause. The meaning of "ought to know" in subsection (3) is closely modelled on the approach in Section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 for determining whether a person who is or was a director ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that a company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation. I am sure that is right.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para3"></a>However, the drafting of subsection (3) reflects the limited circumstances of this particular clause compared with the wider circumstances covered by <P>


<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 214. The only differences are the omission in this clause of words in Section 214 which have no application here.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para4"></a>It is surprising that my noble friend is suggesting with his Amendment No. 64 that we should drop from the Bill a perfectly good and useful definition and instead put a definition in separate legislation. Usually the Government are criticised for leaving detail out of a Bill and only supplying it later. Here it seems to be the reverse. I think it would be much better to leave the definition in subsection (3) so that everyone can see the whole picture. I can assure my noble friend that the much broader question of directors' duties to the company will be dealt with as soon as possible in its rightful place, namely the main companies Bill. To take it out of the companies Bill would be a strange way of proceeding. It is absolutely critical to any companies Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   Can the Minister answer my question about whether we can expect a statement on the plans for reform of directors' liabilities before the Bill is passed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The answer is yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I congratulate my noble friend on that statement, which is a very <P>


<a name="column_GC138"></a>

<B>17 Mar 2004 : Column GC138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important advance. We shall get an answer, so I shall be caused such distress for only a limited time. I remain distressed that he insists on impaling himself on the hook that he has created, a hook that demands that he dangle between one standard of care under the Bill and a different standard of care, diligence and so on in the rest of company law. We shall have to deal with that as best we may.
<P>

<a name="40317-23_para5"></a>The courts may well advance their jurisprudence in the light of whatever statement the Government make before the enactment of the Bill. That is a most important revelation. Whereas I thought that I would feel hopelessly lost, given the curious position, I now feel much comforted and am very grateful to the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will describe the essence of the defence of necessity in cases involving the Official Secrets Act indicating the origins of this defence and the main cases in recent years in which it has been used.[HL1597]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  Necessity is a common law defence which applies to all crimes. The origin of the defence of necessity in Official Secrets Act cases arises from the case of David Shayler, who was prosecuted for an offence under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. In that case the Court of Appeal decided that in addition to the defences specifically provided by the Act the defence of duress or necessity of circumstance was available to defendants charged with an offence contrary to Section 1 of the 1989 Act.
<P>

<a name="40317w01_para0"></a>The essence of the defence is that it is available when a defendant commits an otherwise criminal act to avoid an imminent peril of danger to life or serious injury to himself or towards somebody for whom he regards himself as responsible. That person need not be named and may not be identifiable. If it is not possible to name the person it must be possible to identify them by reason of the threat to them which may be avoided by the defendant taking action. The defendant has a responsibility for them because he is placed in a position where he has a choice whether to take or not to take the action which will avoid them being injured. The act done should be no more than is reasonably necessary to avoid the harm feared and the harm resulting from the act should not be disproportionate to the harm avoided.
<P>

<a name="40317w01_para1"></a>The defence of necessity has been used in the case of David Shayler and was raised by the defence in the case of Katharine Gun.

Advice is also given about making a claim for compensation.
<P>

<a name="40317w01_para2"></a>The directorate offers ex-gratia payments for the cost of a replacement passport and any other reasonable expenses associated with obtaining the replacement document, including any expenses or losses occasioned by the individual being unable to travel as planned.

<A NAME="40317w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  Prior to 2002 no recommendations were made for multi-member electoral divisions.

<A NAME="40317w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>When the national 1985 standards of fire cover will be withdrawn and replaced by fire cover arrangements based on the individual integrated risk management plans drawn up by fire authorities in England and Wales; and who will be responsible from that date for ensuring that the new fire cover arrangements are as efficient and effective as the 1985 standards.[HL1805]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  The recommended standards of fire cover will be superseded from 1 April 2004 when fire and rescue authorities implement their first agreed integrated risk management plans. These plans will detail locally determined response standards on the basis of authorities' assessment of risks to the community.
<P>

<a name="40317w01_para3"></a>Fire and rescue authorities have responsibility for making provision for firefighting purposes to efficiently meet all normal requirements.
<P>

<a name="40317w01_para4"></a>The Audit Commission will be responsible for assessing performance and will introduce a new inspection regime for the Fire and Rescue Service in co-operation with the Fire Service Inspectorate.

<A NAME="40317w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Moynihan  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What percentage of new recruits to the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force passed the initial fitness tests in the most recent year for which figures are available; and what were the equivalent figures over the past 10 years.[HL1644]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40317w01_spmin4"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  The information is not held centrally in the manner requested. Nevertheless, I am able to provide the following details.
Naval Service
All RN recruits are required to undertake a pre-joining fitness test which must be passed before entering the Service. Pass rates in the potential Royal Marines course average out at 50 to 55 per cent.
Army
All Army recruits must pass the initial fitness test in order to complete recruit training. Failure to complete a fitness test results in the recruit being retrained and retested.
RAF
All RAF recruits undertake the fitness test in week one of phase 1 training and again at the end of phase 1. During the period April to December 2003, the pass rates were 80 per cent and 88 per cent respectively. All recruits are expected to attain the standards of the RAF fitness test before the end of phase 2 training.

<P>
<A NAME="40317w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  The information is not held centrally in the format requested. The following information is available.
Naval Service
All naval recruits have passed their initial swimming tests. RN recruits have to pass this element of their training before moving into the fleet. It is mandatory for a Marine to have completed the battle swimming test before he can be operationally deployed.
Army
Army recruits are not required to pass the military swimming test (MST). The MST may be completed at any time during a soldier's service and is recorded on each soldier's record of service.
RAF
The RAF has tested the swimming ability of new entrants only since June 2003. Between June 2003 and March 2004, some 1,775 recruits undertook their initial RAF swimming test, and 357 (20 per cent) could not achieve the required swimming standard.

No decision has yet been made about the outcome of this project and we will do so only following full and careful consideration of all the options. Although we are moving towards this point, I am not yet in a position to say exactly when this will be.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<a name="40317w02_para0"></a>As soon as chapters of guidance have been cleared by the practitioners' group, they will be made available on the department's website, www.dca.gov.uk, so that practitioners within government and in the wider public sector can see the broad thrust of advice before publication.
<P>

<a name="40317w02_para1"></a>Work on the remaining guidance chapters is continuing and the department aims to issue the complete set of guidance in final edited format by September 2004. Copies of the guidance will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses at that time.

Table A covers those organisations named in the Question except the Electoral Commission, which is an independent body accountable directly to Parliament. It also assumed responsibility for the Local Government Boundary Committee for England in April 2002. As the Government have no responsibility for either the commission or the committee, the noble Lord may wish to write to the chairman of the Electoral Commission on the matters he raises. Table B covers other relevant government organisations.

As part of the Change Programme within the Department of Health, 14 whole-time equivalent Civil Service posts moved on 1 August 2003, with the associated functions, into a special health authority set up in shadow form to support dentists and the National Health Service in the run-up to the reform of NHS dentistry provided for in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. This special health authority will replace the Dental Practice Board in due course.
<P>

<a name="40317w02_para2"></a>Both the Office of the Chief Dental Officer and the special health authority (shadow arrangements) are supported by a number of contractors and staff seconded from other organisations such as the NHS to work on specific projects.

<a name="40317w02_para3"></a>At 31 July 2003 just prior to the establishment of the special health authority (shadow arrangements) a total of 21 whole-time equivalent posts (excluding the post of Chief Dental Officer) were assigned to work on dentistry supported by a number of contractors and seconded staff. Additional support was provided as necessary by staff from the support divisions such as finance and human resources and from senior managers in the department. Arrangements for this additional support remain unchanged under the departmental change programme.

The level of remuneration is determined by the annual review and recommendations of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body.
<P>

<a name="40317w03_para0"></a>Based on the community dental officer salary scale published on 1 April 2003, a CDS dentist would earn: &#163;29,365 after one year's experience and &#163;31,815 to &#163;39,165 after two to five years' experience.
<P>

<a name="40317w03_para1"></a>The community dental officer salary scale has eight spine points, so a dentist with eight years' experience on the 1 April 2003, would earn &#163;46,515 subject to satisfactory performance.

One function of the community dental service is to provide dental care and treatment for people with special needs, including homeless people, from fixed-site and mobile outreach clinics. Forty-six NHS dental access centres located in areas of poor oral health provide dental services for patients who may not otherwise access dentistry.

<a name="40317w03_para9"></a>The Department for Transport's Security Directorate (TRANSEC), in conjunction with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), has the policy lead and is responsible for introducing the ISPS code requirements.

<P>

<a name="40317w03_para14"></a>Any ship that does not comply with the UK's standards for implementing the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code will not be issued with a certificate. Once an ISSC has been issued, the responsibility for ensuring continued adherence to the ship security plan will fall on the ship. UK flagged ships will be subject to compliance inspections, but the Government will not be in a position to compensate any operator that fails to maintain an adequate level of security.
