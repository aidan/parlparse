<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government when they propose to introduce regulations under the Health Bill [HL] to prohibit the retail display of tobacco products and the sale of cigarettes from vending machines.</p>
</ul>

The proposed regulations were published for consultation on 12 October. The consultation period is due to end on 4 January 2010.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>

Can she confirm that following the passage of the McCartney amendment in another place, which proposed a complete ban on the sale of cigarettes from vending machines, that matter will also be included in the consultation process? Can she further confirm that the requirement to notify the EU of the regulations under this Bill should go ahead immediately after Royal Assent, which hopefully will be next week, in the interest of protecting the health of children?</p>

As regards the consultation period on the regulations, as the part of the regulations concerning vending machines will have to be looked at again, those orders might be laid slightly later. However, we are currently considering the timetable. We will very shortly be notifying the European Commission on all the regulations though not those in relation to vending machines. Those regulations will depend on what happens next week. However, we intend to notify the Commission very shortly indeed. So that will run concurrently with the consultation period.</p>

Does she agree that that was a very serious underestimate because it was based on bulk sales and did not include installation or shipping? Bearing in mind the severe impact of the credit crunch on the typical small confectioner-tobacconist-newsagent, and the number of bankruptcies last year in that field, some delay would be warranted in this case.</p>

In the cause of complete transparency, all the records of exchanges between Department of Health officials and the major Canadian company that provided the estimated costs have been placed on the website. The most recent estimate is &#163;450, which would provide 25 square feet of display for a single small shop. We are working with the Association of Convenience Stores and other retailers to develop the proposed regulations. These regulations will not come into force until 2011 for supermarkets and 2013 for small shops, by which time I anticipate, although it is beyond my brief, that the downturn will be over.</p>

As I understand it, the proposal is that tobacco should be prohibited from sale in vending machines, but that an alternative proposal has been put forward that mechanisms should be put in place to allow, for example, bar staff to operate vending machines automatically. Is it the case that the Government are not accepting that proposal? Further, is the Minister aware that a recent survey of landlords showed that most of them are not in favour of those alternative arrangements because they think that they are unworkable?</p>

However, following the debate and decision in another place, the Government do not intend to try to reverse the decision, but to support it when we discuss the Bill again next Monday. We have already allowed vending machine operators more than 10 years in which to tighten up their operations to prevent underage sales of tobacco to children and young people. That is the context in which the decision was taken in another place.</p>

I, too, was present for our deliberations in Grand Committee on the Health Bill and, particularly, on the provisions concerning smoking. I asked a question several times then to which I never got a satisfactory answer, so I will ask the Minister this question. When she looks at the cost of installing these fixtures in small shops, will she please ask whether it will be the shopkeepers or the tobacco manufacturers who pay for them? I have a feeling that the answer will be that it is the latter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0911028000023"></a>Turning to the Question, military personnel and their families who are posted or serving overseas are able to vote by post or by proxy. The Government are working with the Electoral Commission to support their participation in any future elections. A defence instruction notice is published to inform personnel of the date and nature of the election and key dates by which individuals must be registered to vote.

Remembering that one-third of Armed Forces personnel are not registered to vote, would it not be easiest, especially for those whose lives are at risk for us, to register automatically everyone who is recruited into the Armed Forces and then give them the opportunity to apply for a postal or proxy vote?

With regard to those being introduced into our services, information about registration is given at the time of the induction procedure, and the MoD and others try to keep registration up to date, paying particular attention to it when people are deployed abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0911028000026"></a>On the latter point, getting party political material to any voter is the responsibility of the parties themselves, and it would be wrong for the MoD to intervene in that. I do not know whether the Ministry of Justice, which has overall responsibility for elections, might be willing to consider that point, but I will ensure that that is brought to its attention.</p>

The service voter registration order increased the period of registration for service voters. However, we are finding that the majority of service voters are actually registered at a domestic address; three-quarters are registered in that way. It is true that not as many are registered as we would wish, but the trend is improving. The next survey to identify any changes in the past 12 months is currently being undertaken.</p>

I know that the Ministry of Justice, with the Electoral Commission and other interested parties including the MoD, is considering whether there are other means of facilitating the participation in elections by those who are abroad. Obviously this has to be thought through very carefully in order to avoid the potential for fraud, but there is real awareness of this problem and a clear intention to do everything possible to ease the situation.</p>

That report has been published and says that there is serious evidence of war crimes which ought to be investigated.

It does not allow us to resile from our obligations to have an independent and thorough investigation into the Israeli defence forces.

Does he not agree that the Israeli Government&#146;s rather intemperate attacks on the Goldstone report might be a little more credible if they had actually been prepared to admit Judge Goldstone and his colleagues to Israel, and to co-operate with them, which they refused to do? Would it not be better if they addressed the report rather than playing the man?</p>

If we were to ask the Taliban what they thought of the civilian deaths occurring in Afghanistan, for example, and were to report that to a largely hostile United Nations commission, it would make it extremely difficult for any army to go to war in any situation.</p>

My noble friend Lady Kinnock is in South Africa this week and I have no doubt that Zimbabwe will not be without note in her discussions with the South African Government. We also work with our European Union colleagues, who have a major part to play in bringing that country back to normality.

This lays out how committees should communicate their advice and working practices and concludes that, as a minimum, committees should publish a programme of work, meeting agendas, minutes, final advice and an annual report.</p>

However, has this episode not destroyed the claim that policy would be based on evidence? Does not the dismissal of Professor Nutt suggest that advice, on the whole, should be kept private, and that the findings about the influence of alcohol as compared with cannabis should not be communicated to the public domain&#151;not in front of the children? What can the Government do to reassure the scientific community and to counteract the rather dispiriting message which they have given its members that they may not contradict government policy, and that if they do they will be sacked?</p>

The issue is not about what the advice was. The Government, at the end of the day, cannot delegate to any advisory committee the decisions that belong to the Secretary of State and to this Parliament. It is and has been the case in the past that some committee advisers have resigned and subsequently disagreed with government policy; that is one issue. It is quite a different issue to make a statement effectively arguing that the decision of the Secretary of State whom you advise is totally wrong, while continuing in office and continuing to campaign against the Government you are advising. The issue is not about scientific advice on this occasion. It is about the role of the person, the code of conduct and how he continued a campaign that is not within the code and is not within what I would expect of advisers. The day that Ministers are no longer responsible for making decisions and Parliament is no longer responsible for ratifying those decisions, we are in the hands of non-elected democracies&#151;democratic in the sense only of science and not in the wider world.</p>

If there are consistent, cavalier rejections by a Minister of recommendations by a committee, one might ask what the point of the committee is. However, they are not consistently rejected. On cannabis, out of 21 recommendations only one was not accepted. On ecstasy, of 13 recommendations, 11 were accepted and only two were not. The Home Secretary agreed a structured programme with the ACMD, covering illegal high poly-drug use, early warning mechanisms and cognitive enhancers. Basically, the science has been taken on board where the science makes sense. Where the wider political judgments come in, we had to take account of everything from law enforcement to public opinion. The buck stops with the Secretary of State.</p>

If, for example, every recommendation irrespective of whether it was in the wider interest were accepted by Ministers on almost every subject, you would find the country at large wondering what the point of Ministers was. They would wonder, &#147;What is the point of Members of Parliament? What is the point of Parliament? Why not have a series of expert opinions?&#148;. Expert opinion is valid. Science is valid. We are not arguing here about the science. We are arguing about the responsibility of Ministers in the final analysis, and I totally agree with my noble friend.</p>

Therefore, I am absolutely clear that it remains a decision for Ministers and Parliament, and Professor Nutt is now clear and free to express whatever opinions he wants. However, he will not be able to do that successfully in his own defence, or in the defence of the Government, while being chief adviser to them and at the same time campaigning against government policy.</p>

Before I turn to them, I should thank noble Lords in all parts of the House for their co-operation in Committee and in the run-up to this Report stage. I hope it is clear from the amendments tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Morgan that we have listened carefully and responded positively to the concerns that noble Lords raised in Committee. We believe that this exemplifies how the Committee, and this House as a whole, is working as it should.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0911028000088"></a>I will first address Amendments 1 to 13, 15 to 19 and 20 to 23, which are intended to ensure that we have a clear definition of what it means to complete an  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apprenticeship. Noble Lords made clear at the outset in Committee their appetite for a definition. Amendment 1 is intended to address the issues raised by the amendment that the House accepted on 16 June.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0911028000089"></a>The new clauses reflect the fact that the provisions in Part 1 focus on completing the requirements of an apprenticeship framework, with the completion recognised through the issue of a certificate by the issuing authority. The standard English or Welsh completion conditions include the need to complete the apprenticeship training while working under an apprenticeship agreement covered by an apprenticeship framework in England and Wales. Amendments 18 to 25 incorporate the core elements of Clause 1. In particular, there is an explicit reference in Clauses 26 and 30, which set out the contents of the specification of apprenticeship standards for England and Wales, to a requirement for an apprenticeship framework to include both on-the-job and off-the-job training.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0911028000090"></a>We have also taken the opportunity through the amendments to address the concerns raised by my noble friends Lord Layard, Lady Blackstone and Lady Morris of Yardley that there should be a requirement in the Bill that apprenticeship frameworks must specify relevant occupational competencies and relevant technical knowledge. This, too, has been incorporated into Clauses 26 and 30. Therefore, I hope that my noble friends will not press Amendment 17 in their name.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0911028000091"></a>It is crucial that employed status remains a key element of an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are paid jobs. However, we recognise that there must be a degree of flexibility to allow for special, clearly defined circumstances. These include cases where an apprentice has been made redundant and needs to complete part of their apprenticeship on an unpaid basis; self-employed apprentices in some sectors; and Olympic athletes on the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence framework.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0911028000092"></a>We have also listened carefully to representations received about the valuable work-based training provided by Barnardo&#146;s and Rathbone. The regulation-making power in Clause 2(5), which is incorporated in the new clause inserted by Amendment 1, is intended to allow for these special cases and enable us to make provision for alternative completion conditions. In the case of Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s, we propose to allow for a period of up to six months&#146; work experience or up-front training prior to entering an apprenticeship agreement. This pre-apprenticeship contract period of work-based training is not in itself an apprenticeship. It would count towards the completion of an apprenticeship framework and the award of an apprenticeship certificate only if the young person is employed as an apprentice in the six-month period. I make clear that the apprenticeship would start, and count towards official apprenticeship statistics, only when the learner is employed.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0911028000093"></a>The detail of what this six-month period would look like will need to be agreed when regulations are being drafted. We are committed to working with Rathbone, Barnardo&#146;s and other interested parties on the regulations. We believe that introducing the six-month period will give employers sufficient time to determine the capability and employability of the learner, and act as an incentive to employers to take on the learners as employees more rapidly than is current practice. This

Our desire to support the young people with chaotic backgrounds that Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s seek to assist should not be interpreted in any way as diluting our commitment to the employment requirement, which remains fundamental to an apprenticeship. In view of the importance that we attach to this principle, we are minded to propose that the regulations that permit alternative completion conditions should be subject to affirmative resolution requiring a debate in both Houses. We will return to this at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0911028000094"></a>We have also taken the opportunity in the new clauses to address the concerns of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, about the requirement for a person to work either wholly or mainly in England or wholly or mainly in Wales, and whether they would be eligible for an apprenticeship certificate. Under the new clauses, together with Amendments 4 and 7, we have removed the provision for &#147;English&#148; and &#147;Welsh&#148; apprenticeship agreements. This means that if a person enters into an apprenticeship agreement in connection with either an English or Welsh framework, regardless of where they work, they will be issued with a certificate, provided they meet the requirements.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0911028000218"></a>On Amendments 9 and 12, in Committee I gave a commitment to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that I would review the need in Clause 12(1)(a) and Clause 17(1)(a) to designate a person to issue frameworks generally. Since we have given a commitment to this House and the other place that framework-issuing authorities will be sector skills councils and other sectoral bodies which issue apprenticeship frameworks, I have concluded that these powers are not necessary and should be removed.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0911028000095"></a>Since Amendments 34, 88 to 89, 111 to 113, 126 to 127 and 228 are consequential to the proposed new clauses and restructuring in Part 1 and are mainly technical in nature, I do not intend to detain noble Lords any longer and, without further ado, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="0911028000096"></a><b><a name="91102-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0911028000412"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, we acknowledge the enormous efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Young, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, and their Bill team in taking on board the concerns and arguments which came from all parts of the Chamber in Committee. It is a testament to the hard work of all concerned that we now see so many government amendments in the final stages of the Bill. Most of the government amendments in this group are designed to adapt the Bill to the amendment tabled in Committee by myself and my noble friends Lord Hunt of Wirral and Lady Verma, which was then voted into the Bill. The purpose of this amendment was to provide a statutory definition of an apprenticeship, and a definition still seems sensible and necessary.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0911028000097"></a>The Government trumpeted the arrival of this Bill, saying that it would bring in a statutory entitlement to an apprenticeship for 16 to 18 year-olds. A definition of that entitlement therefore seemed, to us and many others, crucial. Apprentices, employers, employees and the wider public need absolute clarity about what this entails and what the qualification means. As the noble Lord, Lord Young, said in Committee in June, the Bill is not just about creating more apprenticeships but  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_18"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about ensuring that they remain a respected brand, with people feeling that they are being given a real career opportunity and delivered a quality experience.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0911028000098"></a>We are delighted, therefore, to welcome the government amendments, which have taken on board our key concerns that a statutory definition of an apprenticeship should include a requirement for: both on-the-job and off-the-job training; training in the relevant occupational competencies and technical knowledge, which will require using the practices, equipment and personnel of the job; and training which will lead to the relevant and recognised level of proficiency in a specific trade or occupation. Ideally, we would have liked to see a clear definition at the start of the Bill, as in the amendment we voted in at Committee. Nevertheless we accept the Government&#146;s word that, given the structure of the rest of the Bill, our definition might have created difficulties in legal terms. We therefore accept the Government&#146;s amendments, which we feel help to define the brand more fully as a starting point.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0911028000099"></a>As the Minister will have heard time and again, we have been worried about the potential damage to the apprenticeship brand. In 2006, the Adult Learning Inspectorate warned:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0911028000242"></a>&#147;Some apprentices can potentially achieve the full requirements of the apprenticeship framework without having to set foot in a workplace&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0911028000219"></a>Furthermore, in 2008 Ofsted confirmed in its report entitled <I>The Impact of Programme-Led Apprenticeships </I>that many of the apprenticeships created by the Government were, in fact, virtual without much contact or training with an employer at all. We are therefore pleased that the Government have conceded that further clarification was necessary. We welcome also the Government&#146;s intentions regarding a pre-apprenticeship contract, which would make it possible for work-based training to remain a useful and important part of the preparation for the workplace but separate from the more specific apprenticeship brand. We welcome it because we have long called for more emphasis on pre-apprenticeship training and we have appreciated its importance to people, particularly in a time of economic difficulty when training and reskilling become even more important.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0911028000100"></a>We are most concerned that there should be a firm and resolute reassurance that the pre-apprenticeship contract will not form part of the apprenticeship. I think I heard the Minister say that the apprenticeship would start only when the apprentice was employed. Perhaps, in due course, he would confirm that for me. I also gather from his words that the period for this pre-apprenticeship will be only up to six months. Again, perhaps he could inform us what would happen if an apprentice were unable to find an employment contract after that six-month period. What risk is there that it might creep into a longer-term pre-apprenticeship? Would the young person be made redundant, or would they continue under the term &#147;training contract&#148; rather than &#147;apprenticeship&#148;? There are many options and we must be absolutely clear what the results will be.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0911028000101"></a>In conclusion, does the Minister wish to expand on the impact that he feels the Bill will have on the apprenticeships market? Given that the number of

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="0911028000102"></a><b><a name="91102-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0911028000413"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Government very much for the lengthy discussions that we have had on these issues. I also congratulate them on the outcome, which is extremely satisfactory. We now have incorporated into the Bill a very clear definition of the concept of apprenticeship which applies equally in England and in Wales. We spent a lot of time on that interesting issue, thanks to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. Before debating the matter I had not fully realised the problems that could be posed by having an apprenticeship that applied to England only.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0911028000103"></a>A number of other important aspects of apprenticeships are now also incorporated in the legislation, such as on-the-job and off-the-job training. Thanks to the work of the noble Lord, Lord Layard, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady Morris, we also have the distinction that the completion of an apprenticeship shows both occupational competence&#151;defined as the competence required to perform a skill, trade or occupation, to which the framework applies&#151;and the relevant technical knowledge required to back up that skill, trade or occupation. Left untouched were Clauses 31 and 93, which make it clear that the apprenticeship agreement normally involves a contract of employment. Last but not least it does away with the concept of a general framework introduced in Clause 12(1)(a)&#151;which is now to be deleted, and about which none of us was very clear though we asked many questions about it, leaving only frameworks accredited by the relevant sector skills councils or appropriate bodies. We applaud and are very grateful to the Minister for making that clear.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para16"></a>

In their notes to us about these clauses the Bill team and the Minister spelt out that the alternative completion conditions would apply where a person is not working under an apprenticeship agreement and does not have an employer. That would include, for example, self-employed apprentices; apprentices carrying out voluntary work in order to complete their apprenticeships when they have been made redundant; and apprentices doing advanced apprenticeships in sporting excellence, who may well be Olympic athletes who are not working at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0911028000105"></a>The issue of those working with Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s still poses some problems. The Minister introduced this new concept, which we discussed in Committee, of pre-apprenticeship training. All noble Lords who were present at the Committee stage are very sympathetic to the work done by Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s, and we on these Benches feel strongly that these young people&#151;many of whom, as the Minister said, come from very chaotic backgrounds, and who are given the opportunity to enter an apprenticeship through some kind of pre-apprenticeship training&#151;should not lose out on these opportunities. Will the Minister confirm whether, during this period, when they are in

This is one of the issues which Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s are concerned about.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0911028000106"></a>The Minister has made it fairly clear that the apprenticeship proper would start within or at the end of six months of pre-apprenticeship training, and that they would not therefore be properly employed apprentices. We are keen that they should be employed by somebody, but this would not start until then. Will the Minister clarify whether they will continue to be funded, and whether they will count as apprentices in the national statistics? I thank the Minister and the team working on the Bill for what they have achieved. We have had a substantial reframing of the concept of the apprenticeship agreement, which is now well defined within the Bill and is explicit in its requirements. We on these Benches are extremely happy to back these amendments.</p>

<a name="0911028000107"></a><b><a name="91102-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0911028000414"></a>Lord Layard:</b> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment 17. I welcome the spirit of government Amendments 18, 19 and 21, which establish the need for an apprentice to demonstrate technical knowledge as well as occupational competence. However, we need to go further than this. It is essential that technical knowledge be separately assessed and not just demonstrated in some way which could be part of on-the-job assessment. If it is not separately assessed, there is a serious danger that it will be watered down. In our amendment we propose to prevent that. Technical knowledge should be demonstrated in a separate certificate; a so-called technical certificate has been the lingo in the apprenticeship world for some years. At a very minimum, we should insist that it be separately assessed&#151;if not in a separate certificate, then separately within a unified certificate. We urge the Government to think further on this matter, and, at a minimum, guarantee in the Bill a separate assessment. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0911028000108"></a>I would like to make an observation on the nearby government Amendment 20. It seems to me a really retrograde step and I do not understand why it is in here. It states that where a framework requires a separate technical certificate, such as a BTEC, and an occupationally based certificate, such as an NVQ, the framework shall identify the NVQ as the &#147;principal&#148; qualification in relation to the overall framework because, the amendment states, it is,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000283"></a>&#147;the qualification that demonstrates the relevant occupational competencies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000220"></a>Why is it more important to demonstrate the relevant occupational competencies than to demonstrate the technical knowledge? Why is it necessary to say which of the two is the more important? I do not understand why that has been introduced at this point when the Government have in all other respects been so helpful in raising the importance attached to technical knowledge. Why do we need that amendment? Perhaps the Minister will explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0911028000110"></a>I support the points made by Barnardo's and Rathbone, because they have been doing an extremely important job in helping disadvantaged youngsters join programmes such as a workplace-led apprenticeship with employers. I do not feel entirely happy that the six months proposed will entirely meet the needs of all those young people, because many come from chaotic families and others will have different problems, such as learning difficulties. I would have been happier, as would Rathbone and Barnardo's, if a little more flexibility could have been given by referring to the first half, rather than six months, of the workplace apprenticeship.</p>

<a name="91102-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0911028000111"></a>That said, I hope, because finance will be involved in all this, that more thought will be given by the Government as to how more employers can be encouraged to go along those lines, so that more opportunities are open for the people whom we all know do not have the necessary qualifications, who will increasingly have to stay on at school because of the raising of the school leaving age, and so on. A lot more needs to be thought through about how we make it much easier to get those young people to learn the skills that this country so urgently needs.</p>

We share exactly the same view about the importance of the apprenticeship brand. Indeed, for some time we have said that a programme for a learning apprenticeship does not count towards statistics for apprenticeships unless there is an employer connection. If there is not, it is not an apprenticeship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0911028000113"></a>To reiterate on the point of concern regarding Barnardo&#146;s and Rathbone, there is a balance to be struck here. Although I heard the plea from the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for flexibility, there is a limit where flexibility goes too far and we start to damage the brand. We have tried to strike that important balance. We have made clear that the six-month pre-apprenticeship contract period of work-based training is not in itself an apprenticeship. It will count towards the completion of an apprenticeship framework and the award of an apprenticeship certificate only if the young person is employed as an apprentice within the six-month period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0911028000114"></a>Let me also be absolutely clear that the apprenticeship would only start and would only count towards official apprenticeship statistics once the learner was employed. I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the six months&#146; training would be funded the National Apprenticeship Service. We have tried to strike a balance&#151;we recognise the valuable nature of that work. As we said previously, the precise detail of the six-month period will need to be agreed when regulations are being drafted. We are committed to working with Rathbone, Barnardo&#146;s and other interested parties on these regulations. I note the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made in relation to those with

We are dealing with that separately in further amendments, where you will see we have made real and significant progress with helping those people.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0911028000115"></a>I will deal first with the second of the two questions raised by my noble friend Lord Layard because the paper happens to be on the top. He asked why the competence qualification is the principal qualification. From an employer&#146;s perspective it is important that apprentices have technical knowledge, but the competence qualification demonstrates that they can actually do the job. I know my noble friend Lady Blackstone is shaking her head. As a former apprentice, I think that I have a touch more experience&#151;there are not many areas in which I would say that&#151;and it would not be the first situation that I have encountered where you can have all the technical qualifications in the world but the ability to do the job, the ability to carry out the work, is what is important. I have known a number of electrical apprentices who were great in theory, but I am afraid when it came to cabling the house and completing the job in a satisfactory time could not actually do it. Ultimately, ability in that area will create their employment prospects.</p>

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="0911028000116"></a><b><a name="91102-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0911028000417"></a>Baroness Blackstone:</b> My Lords, does the Minister agree that, while it is enormously important that anybody who has been through an apprenticeship is competent at the job, to be competent they must also have acquired a considerable amount of knowledge about the work they are doing in whatever area it might be and be technically able to carry out that work?</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="0911028000117"></a><b><a name="91102-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0911028000418"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that there is a balance to be struck and in no way am I dismissing the requirement for technical knowledge. However, there are now more than 200 apprenticeship frameworks whose requirements vary hugely from ones such as retail where the amount of technical knowledge will be significantly less to the much more complicated engineering, electrical and IT apprenticeship frameworks. It really is horses for courses. I do not mean in any way to dismiss the importance of technical knowledge&#151;it is fundamentally important.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0911028000118"></a>The other point raised by my noble friend Lord Layard was that of separate technical knowledge and occupational competence qualifications. Many apprenticeships contain separate qualifications but there are single qualifications that cover both points. Where appropriate, they will be separately assessed. We understand the importance of that and do not wish to demean it, but there are examples of apprenticeship frameworks where this does not apply. The way that we have structured it is appropriate given the vast number of apprenticeship frameworks. I believe that I have dealt with all the points that were raised and I commend the amendment to the noble Lords.</p>

We say that more than being in the specification, where it already is, it should be in the Bill. We will come back to this at Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0911028000120"></a>I asked the Minister why there has to be a principal qualification at all, not why there should be one rather than another. I do not know why it has to be so.</p>

I may not have quite understood the essence of his question. In some cases, they will be assessed together, but there will still be an assessment of whatever technical knowledge is required. It may be part of a joint process rather than a separate one.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0911028000122"></a>We still believe in the pre-eminence of the competence qualification. As I have said, this is not a question of undermining the importance of technical knowledge. We may need to have further dialogue on this issue. I think we both want to ensure the quality of an apprenticeship, and I hope we can resolve the slight difference that may exist between us.</p>

That is the whole point of the pattern of apprenticeships and the pathway we put people on. Qualifications are hugely important, and technical ability is important, but does my noble friend agree that the technical requirements of apprenticeships vary across the patch? Every employer needs to know that the individual can not only do technically good work but do the job which the employer hopes to employ them to do.</p>

I reflect briefly on the fact that some employees come from a university background. They are exceedingly well qualified in theory, but they lack knowledge of the world of work and sometimes the ability to apply the theory.

In other cases, one hopes that every apprentice will be found a place, but that cannot always be guaranteed. In the situation described by the noble Lord, it is quite clear that it is not an apprenticeship unless there is a contract of employment. Each case will be individual.

<a name="0911028000128"></a><b><a name="91102-0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0911028000433"></a>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Baroness Royall of Blaisdon):</b> My Lords, with the permission of the House, I will repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0911028000129"></a>&#147;First, Mr Speaker, I am sure the whole House will join with me in sending our condolences to the family and friends of Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, who was killed in Afghanistan on Saturday afternoon. We owe him and every one of our Armed Forces an immeasurable debt of gratitude.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0911028000130"></a>With permission, I would like to make a Statement on the European Council held in Brussels last Thursday and Friday. The Copenhagen climate change conference for which the European Council was preparing is now less than 40 days away. If carbon emissions are to be reduced and dangerous climate change averted, it is essential that we achieve an ambitious, comprehensive and binding agreement. Concluding a climate change deal will also drive investment in the low carbon economy and speed up world economic recovery. It will demonstrate that, as at the G20, the world can come together to address the great global challenges we face together.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0911028000131"></a>In all this, European Union leadership is fundamental and now, as we approach Copenhagen, we need to drive forward the negotiations. Let me explain the urgency: to achieve the ambitious, effective and fair deal we need, it is not only developed countries which must act. Developing countries too must cut their emissions, reduce deforestation and be able to adapt to climate change. But to enable them to do so by December we need to make a credible offer of financial assistance now. That is why earlier this year I proposed a long-term financial agreement between developed and developing countries.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0911028000132"></a>On Friday last week, the Council agreed to put on the table for Copenhagen three conditional offers. First, we agreed that Europe will contribute its fair share of the costs of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, and we endorsed the European Commission&#146;s view that these are expected to require&#151;including the developing countries&#146; own contributions&#151;annually by 2020 around &#8364;100 billion of private and public finance.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0911028000133"></a>Secondly, we set out our offer of public finance, agreeing that the overall level of the international public support required is estimated to lie in the range  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_27"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of &#8364;22 billion to &#8364;50 billion per year by 2020. Thirdly, we agreed that we should start support immediately to help developing countries cut carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, contributing over the next three years our fair share of a global fast-track initiative of &#8364;5 billion to &#8364;7 billion per year.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0911028000134"></a>These offers are rightly conditional on,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000284"></a>&#145;other key players making comparable efforts&#146;,</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000221"></a>and on developing countries coming forward with substantial commitments on emission reductions. Importantly, the Council also agreed that climate financing should,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000285"></a>&#145;not undermine or jeopardise the fight against poverty and continued progress towards the millennium development goals&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000222"></a>Further, as the UK has proposed, the Council supported the establishment of a high-level body under the United Nations to provide an overview of international sources of climate financing.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0911028000135"></a>The European Union has already committed to cut our emissions by 30 per cent on 1990 levels by 2020 as part of the right international agreement. Now, these financial offers yet again show the determination of the whole European Union to ensure an ambitious climate change deal in Copenhagen.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0911028000136"></a>I can also report that the Council agreed that at the time of the next accession treaty, the Protocol on the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be applied to the Czech Republic. The next step is for the Czech Constitutional Court to make its ruling, which is rightly a matter for that court. I believe that we have made real progress, but it is only after we are sure that the treaty will come into force that the Council will be able to appoint its new president.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0911028000137"></a>Investment across Europe is forecast to contract by 10 per cent this year with an expected loss of 8.5 million jobs, so at the European Council we had to decide, first, whether we should withdraw the fiscal stimulus now or maintain it until recovery was secured. We agreed unanimously, with no country dissenting, that</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000286"></a>&#145;the supporting policies should not be withdrawn until the recovery is fully secured&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000223"></a>Secondly, we had to decide whether to support public investment to maintain jobs in our economy or simply to let the recession take its course. The Council agreed unanimously to draw up a,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000287"></a>&#145;European strategy for jobs and growth [with] continued political commitment to active labour market policies&#146;,</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000224"></a>and we agreed to take all necessary measures to,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000288"></a>&#145;prevent high unemployment levels from becoming persistent&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000225"></a>Thirdly, within our commitment to action for fiscal sustainability once the recovery is assured, we also agreed on the need for active industrial strategies to ensure,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000289"></a>&#145;investment in the industries and jobs<sup></sup>of the future&#146;,</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000226"></a>including low carbon technologies, advanced manufacturing and the digital economy.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0911028000138"></a>Fourthly, we stressed the importance of new measures that would &#145;strengthen the internal market&#146; and help growth in our services as well as industries. We also affirmed the need to &#145;promote increased trade&#146;. The   


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_28"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>completion of the Doha trade round next year and progress on bilateral trade deals with India and Canada are central to this, as is the recent trade agreement with Korea, which will create up to &#8364;19 billion in new export opportunities for firms across the EU.</p>

<a name="91102-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0911028000139"></a>We also agreed on reform of our banking systems, which include putting in place new rules on capital and liquidity and bonuses. We agreed to the continuation of work to strengthen the supervisory framework in the European Union following the decisions taken at the Council in June.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91102-0005.htm"/>


<a name="91102-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0911028000140"></a>The Council expressed its deep condolences to the families of those killed in last week&#146;s Taliban attack in Kabul. We reaffirmed our determination to fight terrorism in every part of the world and our resolve to see our commitments through in Afghanistan. We emphasised our,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000290"></a>&#145;confidence in the United Nations&#146; leadership in co-ordinating the international community&#146;s efforts in Afghanistan&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000227"></a>We welcomed EU plans to,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000291"></a>&#145;strengthen the civilian capacity of the state institutions in Afghanistan and Pakistan&#146;,</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000228"></a>something that has been at the heart of British efforts in recent years. The Council expressed its concern about the security situation in Pakistan and reiterated Europe&#146;s readiness to assist further the affected population. This afternoon, I have spoken to President Karzai and discussed the importance of moving quickly to set out a unity programme for the future of Afghanistan. Afghanistan now needs new and urgent measures for tackling corruption, strengthening local government and reaching out to all parts of Afghan society, and to give the Afghan people a real stake in their future. President Karzai agreed with me that Afghanistan now needs to strengthen its army and police numbers so that over time we can reduce our troops.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0911028000141"></a>Finally, on Iran, the Council expressed its,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000292"></a>&#145;continuing concern about the situation of staff members of European Union missions and European citizens in Iran who recently have been on trial,</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000229"></a>and called for their &#145;prompt and unconditional release&#146;. We also reaffirmed our,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000293"></a>&#145;grave concern over the development of Iran&#146;s nuclear programme [and over Iran&#146;s] persistent failure to meet its international obligations&#146;.</ul>
<a name="91102-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0911028000142"></a>Once again, we in Britain have shown that by acting not alone but together, by working not against our mainstream European partners but with them, and by putting Britain not on the fringes of Europe but at its heart, Britain will be stronger. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para3"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0911028000145"></a>I shall start where the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement finished, on Afghanistan. I have three questions for the Minister. What did EU leaders agree as the strategic objective of the Afghan war? What further commitment of troops was made by any EU state? In view of the continuing deaths and injuries as a result of the lack of airlift capacity, did the Prime Minister ask our EU partners for any help with this problem, and, if so, what was their response?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0911028000146"></a>Paragraph 42 of the presidency conclusions says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="0911028000263"></a>&#147;The European Council stresses the need for the second round of the Presidential election to be credible, inclusive, secure and reflect the will of the Afghan people&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0911028000230"></a>How can the EU, or indeed the UK Government, believe that, after a man whose win we dismissed as corrupt was returned unopposed?</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0911028000147"></a>Beyond the tragic news from Afghanistan, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. However, this is yet another Statement reflecting the declining UK influence in Europe that has flowed&#151;</p>

Our declining influence has flowed from 12 years of policies that have been commended to the House by this Government. We signed the Social Chapter for no gain in return. We gave up our budget rebate for nothing in return. We broke our promise of a referendum on the EU treaty, yet again for nothing in return.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0911028000150"></a>The Prime Minister skulked on the fringes of this summit. Perhaps, before being so censorious about the policy of this party, his party might reflect on some of the defects of its own. The <I>Financial Times </I>reported that the Prime Minister left a meeting of his fellow socialists &#147;in a foul mood&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0911028000151"></a>The Swedish presidency made some welcome progress in promoting action on climate change, something to which the Lisbon treaty is totally irrelevant. We welcome the commitments on carbon reductions that were repeated yet again at the summit, but where, on the 80 per cent to 95 per cent emission reduction target by 2050, did the UK Government commit us? Discussing a &#8364;100 billion annual payment to developing countries by 2020, Mr Barroso said that EU payments should be between &#8364;22 billion and &#8364;50 billion a year by that year. How much of that will be paid by the UK? What firm figure did our Prime Minister put on the table?</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0911028000152"></a>The Prime Minister told a press conference that he had agreed a target of 10 million new jobs in Europe by 2014. However, is the problem in Britain not that unemployment is now far higher than it was in 1997, with 5 million people on out-of-work benefits, the highest youth unemployment in Europe and the highest proportion of children growing up in homes where no one works? Is it not therefore high time that we had a Government in this country who addressed the plight of the poor that this Government&#146;s policies have left behind? With the presidency country Sweden, France, Germany and others out of recession while the UK economy still contracts, how can a Prime Minister who boasts that Britain is leading the world out of recession hope to be taken seriously?</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0911028000153"></a>The Council conclusions promote a so-called &#147;complete package&#148; on the microsupervision of financial institutions. It is no comment on the EU but a blunt fact of international finance that nothing would give more pleasure to financial circles in Paris and Frankfurt than seeing the world&#146;s greatest financial centre outside the US bound in red tape. Will the Minister assure the House in the most unequivocal terms that the Government reject EU microsupervision and that they will not buy

It would be a dereliction of duty if they let that happen.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0911028000154"></a>Finally, will the noble Baroness tell us whether the UK Government are 100 per cent behind Tony Blair as president of Europe? Who in Britain will have a say on Tony Blair or indeed, anyone else as president&#151;perhaps two, three or maybe even a dozen? It is unacceptable to have an unpopular, unelected president imposed on the British people under a treaty on which, thanks to shameful betrayal of their election promises by both the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, no one was allowed to vote?</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0911028000155"></a>Whether or not the Lisbon Treaty is completed by the year end, never again will a Conservative Government allow such major transfers of power to be approved without a referendum. There are plenty of good UK candidates whom we could all advance and support; there are even some that the British people might willingly accept; but Tony Blair is not one of them. Perhaps we can content ourselves with this: ever since the Prime Minister backed Mr Blair with such fired-up enthusiasm, his campaign has hit the rocks. On this one issue, on this one occasion, we may take comfort in the hopeless lack of influence this Prime Minister now wields.</p>

On the matter raised on Afghanistan, I follow the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, because it must be made clear to President Karzai that he is very much on probation if we are to sustain the commitment in this country to fighting the war in Afghanistan. The messages on Pakistan and Iran were clear and understood.

Especially when there is a European Council so close to 11 November and Remembrance Sunday, I think that we of this generation should take some pride in the fact that we have replaced the conflict and carnage of the first 50 years of the 20th century with systems of governance built on democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. It has not all been bad news. Indeed, Europe now stands as an example to the world of how old enemies can put their enmity aside and build something better and new.</p>

First, would the Prime Minister be better employed using his influence to keep Europe co-ordinated in its response to global recession rather than touting Mr Tony Blair around like a political David Beckham looking for some new lucrative spot to occupy? Secondly, would the Leader of the Opposition be better employed spelling out how he intends to deal with climate change, our energy needs, agreements on trade and financial services, the fight against drug smuggling, people

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0911028000159"></a>On Copenhagen and climate change, the Leader of the House is well aware that we are signed up and enthusiastic to make progress there yet, clearly, there is a great deal of work still to be done in a perilously short time. I have only one little worry about this; the Council says, quite rightly, that there is now a real opportunity to create whole new industries and many more jobs from the challenge posed by climate change. If I might tell this story, however, last night I received a phone call from an American friend who told me that he had just been engaged by a large German company that was involved in developing wind energy technology. It wanted his advice on how best it could exploit demand in the British market for that technology.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0911028000160"></a>What really worries me is: where is the evidence that Britain is investing in the industries and know-how that will create the jobs and make use of the opportunities where these commitments to climate change are concerned? Otherwise, we shall be signing up for targets, then relying on German or Danish technology while getting none of the promised job benefits. Those are my short interventions on what was also, by prime ministerial standards, a very short Statement.</p>

As I said when repeating the Statement, that is exactly what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was speaking to President Karzai about earlier today. I am sure that he will continue to have conversations with President Karzai. It will be a difficult job but, together with the rest of the international community, we have to keep him on track.

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0911028000165"></a>On action on climate change, I tell both noble Lords that the Prime Minister has been working with his colleagues over the last days and months, and it is a mark of his determination that he is one of the four Prime Ministers in the European Union who have said that they will, if necessary, go to Copenhagen. It is also a mark of how the Prime Minister is working with his colleagues in the European Union, which is precisely how the advances that were made at the European Council came about. He was not on its fringes, but in the mainstream. On the funding issues, and as an indication of the amount that the UK would contribute to the &#163;22 billion to &#163;50 billion range put forward at the Council, my right honourable friend the Chancellor has put forward that our share of that public finance should be in the range of &#163;7 billion to &#163;10 billion per year. That is what he has said and it is on record.</p>

<a name="91102-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0911028000166"></a>Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is right to be concerned about unemployment, but I respectfully point out that unemployment in the United Kingdom is still less than it is in France and is certainly a great deal less than it is in Spain. Despite the fact that there may be more unemployed people than there were in 1997&#151;I think that is what the noble Lord said&#151;a lot more jobs have been created, so a lot more people are working in this country than was the case in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0911028000167"></a>The financial package to which the noble Lord referred will not be agreed until December. A great deal of work is still continuing. The Government are continuing to make representations and work with colleagues in the Council and the European Commission precisely to ensure that the City of London is not endangered and remains a jewel in our crown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0911028000168"></a>The treaty is not yet ratified and Tony Blair has not yet put his name forward to be president of the European Council. However, I emphasise that we need a strong European Council president. That is why, if Mr Blair put himself forward as a candidate, he would be supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0911028000169"></a>In relation to influence, you can see the Prime Minister&#146;s fingerprints, as it were, all over the Council&#146;s conclusions as regards the jobs and growth strategy and what is happening in Copenhagen. He has shown real leadership at the European Council and it is a testament to him that it has got so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0911028000170"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord McNally, when I walk through the poppy field at Westminster Abbey it revitalises my enthusiasm for the European Union, because it is precisely the values we all share as a European Union which have ensured peace and stability in this part of western Europe for so long. I look forward to enlargement to include the Balkan countries, because I believe that until they are in the European Union there will not be true peace and stability in the whole continent.</p>

There again it is a case of working with people, not in isolation; I must keep stressing that. I take on board the noble Lord&#146;s point about industries and his concern that our industries are not up there, gaining all the necessary jobs and future work in new technologies and green industries. However, my noble friend Lord Mandelson has a very interventionist industrial policy and will come back to noble Lords in writing about the specifics relating to new technologies and green technologies.</p>

Is it not clear to my noble friend&#151;it certainly is to me&#151;that these advances owe much to the sustained commitment of our Prime Minister and the British Government, and to their firm, unwavering and effective engagement with the European Union? Does she share my view that such beneficial outcomes could never be secured by British representatives who profess complete commitment to climate security, but make that commitment impotent by Europhobia which corrodes trust and repels allies?</p>

We throughout this House, as a body, are not sceptical.</p>

The first is what I would call the innovative way in which we will provide a financial mechanism on climate change, to which my noble friend Lord Kinnock has referred. I describe this as a carbon equalisation tax, whereby those who are using a lot more carbon will transfer some ration cards, as it were, to those who use below the average amount of carbon. This is where the European Union is showing leadership in the world, in a way that no single European country could on its own.</p>

The Government is helping the European Union get back on track, in a way which&#151;now that we have shot the fox that the Conservative Party has been hanging on to&#151;shows that this is the only Government in sight in this country who can give a credible position to Britain&#146;s role in the world.</p>

Does she share my dismay that, having listened to what I can only describe as the diatribe from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, he was clearly talking about aspects of Europe other than that which happened in Brussels this weekend? There was no mention of most of the issues that he raised either in the communiqu&#233; or in the Brussels discussions. Does she share my concern that it is a pity that people outside this Chamber who are equally concerned about Europe do not have any constructive views from the leader of the Opposition as to what he thought of the essential issues that were discussed this weekend?</p>

Yes, it is a great shame because there is much substance in the conclusions of the Council. That is the case at every Council but, globally, this Council is particularly important because it was dealing with the key issues of climate change and economic recovery. It is a great shame that Her Majesty&#146;s Official Opposition do not have very clear plans and questions on these fundamental issues.</p>

It is therefore rather sad that the spokesman for the Opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, could not bring himself to say anything positive&#151;not a scintilla&#151;about the European Union, an attitude that will not go unnoticed by centre-right Governments in Europe, particularly in France and in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0911028000180"></a>Clearly, there was a welcome agreement on climate change that shows what can be done when we work together as Europeans. At long last there appears now to be closure to the institutional debate, yet the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, talked about the declining influence of this country. Does he not recall that in the years before 1997 we were surly, on the sidelines and isolated, wholly contrary to our own national interests? Is there a danger of that recurring unless the Official Opposition are willing to look objectively at how best we can pursue our national interests within the European Union? Are we going to have the latter-day Bourbons who have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing about that period, when it was so contrary to our national interest to be so isolated? Is there not a danger, if they were to be in the unwelcome position of succeeding in six months&#146; time, of not letting matters rest? There is also a danger of gestures for the benefit of the Europhobe Back-Benchers, which would again be wholly contrary to our national interest.</p>

This afternoon&#146;s exchanges have included those supporting the Front Bench opposite saying how well the Front Bench is doing and how poorly the leadership of the Opposition are doing.

We have heard throughout the weekend, and before the weekend, that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have been lobbying for Mr Blair to be made the president of the European Council, and they have been supporting that view by saying that what we want is a strong man who can stop the traffic in his motorcade. That puzzles me a little, because, of course, I took part in the debates on the Lisbon treaty. We had a big debate about this position, and we were assured by the Government that the position of president of the European Council was merely about presiding over the Council meetings. That was the assurance that we were given, and those of us who predicted that it would become a much bigger job than that were derided and scorned and told that we were talking nonsense. Now, which is it? Is he going to be a great man on the world stage, representing the EU? Or is he just going to be the president of the European Council who will preside over its meetings?

However, those who believe that Europe must play an important part in the world, standing up and speaking with a strong voice to China, to the United States of America, to Russia, and to all the other powers in the world, think that we need someone with strength, ability and experience, regardless of whether it is a man or a woman. However, there is one ideal candidate. I say this to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who I represented for 26 years in the other place: there is one person who, if there were to be a popular election, would actually get elected as the president of the Council of Europe. That person is Tony Blair.</p>

However, these are critical times globally, so they are critical for the European Union. We need a person of strength, ability and experience.

Does the Leader of the House agree that there is a danger that those who support a particular candidate might be trying to create the perception of a job to suit a person rather than looking for a person to fill the job described in the Lisbon treaty? We must be very careful about that. My own perception of the job is tending not to the minimalist view but certainly to the smaller view&#151;which is that it is chairman of the Council. However, I would disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, when he says that that is the only function of the job. The treaty makes it perfectly clear that that man or that woman will need to drive forward the agenda. However, in driving forward the agenda the chairman can do only what the Council wants him to do. Let us not try to erect a huge, great job out of what is clearly intended in the Lisbon treaty to be a facilitating job to make sure that the agenda of the Council is properly set, that the business of the Council is properly dispatched and that what is decided is implemented.

<a name="0911028000195"></a><b><a name="91102-0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0911028000462"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> My Lords, I agree absolutely with the sentiments expressed in Committee and reflected in the amendments in this group tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Garden, to whom we are indebted. Employers must be consulted at all levels. I will take the opportunity, in moving the amendment and speaking to the others in the group, to set out precisely how that will happen. The most obvious place in which it is essential to engage employers is in the area of apprenticeships. In view of the overwhelming importance of the issue, noble Lords expressed a particular concern in Committee that employers and sector skills councils should be consulted on the specification of apprenticeship standards for England. Amendments 15 and 16 make it explicit that representatives of employers, further education colleges and other training providers must be consulted. While it has not been possible to refer directly to sector skills councils, I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, will accept that the formulation used encompasses sector skills councils and those sector bodies which issue frameworks.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0911028000196"></a>On Amendments 90 and 91, we will expect the National Apprenticeship Service and the Skills Funding Agency, of which it forms part, to work closely with sector skills councils and other sector bodies to encourage participation in apprenticeships so that young people can have the widest range of apprenticeship opportunities possible. It will also be essential to consult employers across a far wider range of issues than apprenticeships. Amendment 91 would require sector skills councils to consult themselves, which I am sure was not the intention of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Clause 117 requires the chief executive of skills funding, in performing the functions of the office, to have regard to any guidance  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_39"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>given by the Secretary of State. Subsection (2) makes it clear that this may include guidance about consultation, and there is a specific peg in subsection (3)(b) to include guidance with employers.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0911028000197"></a>I would like to place on the record a clear commitment that we will use that guidance-making power to require consultation by the Skills Funding Agency and, by extension, the National Apprenticeship Service with employers, their representatives and the sector skills councils. Noble Lords will be interested to know that draft guidance is currently being prepared for consultation. This gives an indicative list of the organisations which includes these bodies. We are also committed to using the Secretary of State&#146;s mirror guidance-making power in Clause 76 to require the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency to consult employers, their representative organisations, sector skills councils and other partners.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0911028000198"></a>Finally, we have reflected further on the strength of feeling with the House that in delivering their new responsibilities for 16 to 19 education and training, local authorities should engage closely with employers. We agree, and we accept that there was a gap in the Bill, which Amendment 81 seeks to address by extending the remit of the YPLA&#146;s statutory guidance to include, most importantly, the local authority&#146;s duty in Clause 42 to encourage employers to participate in education and training. This will mean that the YPLA can make it clear in its statutory guidance, to which local authorities must have regard, that they should consult local employers and their representative, where appropriate, in the exercise of their new duties.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0911028000199"></a>I hope that, taken together, these amendments and commitments will mean that there is proper engagement with employers at every level right across the activities of the Skills Funding Agency, the National Apprenticeship Service, the YPLA, and local authorities. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, will feel able to withdraw her amendments, which by and large deal with consultation in narrower areas of work. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0911028000200"></a><b><a name="91102-0006.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="0911028000463"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for this very positive reaction to the amendments that we tabled in Committee and for the clarification that he has given on the functions of the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency and of the YPLA in relation to the role of local authorities. We tabled Amendments 32, 37, 38, 90, 91 and 94 because we did not find the response we had in Committee to be adequate. We felt that it was not clear that, as well as local education authorities under the YPLA being required to develop local skills strategies, it is clearly also vital that local employers are involved in their discussions. In order to identify where the skills gaps are, local education authorities need to talk to local employers. Our Amendments 37 and 38 seek to encourage participation by local employers. It is all very well encouraging employers to participate in providing education and training but it is also important that the local authorities talk to them and consult them. Although we knew that best practice existed, we felt that it was not always carried forward.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0911028000201"></a>Similarly, on Amendments 90 and 91, the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency was asked, in  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conjunction with the sector skills councils, to encourage employers and their representatives and, in Amendment 94, to take account of the views of employers. That was very reasonable but in Committee those points had not been answered by the Minister. We are very pleased with Amendments 15 and 16. I do not mind the fact that to avoid hybridity you have to go in a roundabout way to describe sector skills councils. I am pleased that there is a reference to the Sharp definition of sector skills councils and am touched that that should be regarded as the Sharp roundabout way of doing it.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0911028000202"></a>On the other issues, I am delighted to get on the record the clarification of the full role for consultation for the sector skills councils, for employers and for such organisations as chambers of commerce which, on occasion, are the appropriate representatives of employers. I am pleased about that and I very much hope that those organisations will note that the fact that they will be consulted is now on the record. I slightly regret that it is not written into the Bill but I think we have the next best thing: an explicit recognition on the part of the Government that they should be consulted and that that will be fully covered in regulations. I am extremely grateful to the Minister for those concessions.</p>

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="0911028000203"></a><b><a name="91102-0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0911028000464"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, in Committee, we discussed the role of sector skills councils in some depth. We on these Benches believed, and still believe, that there was a place for the sector skills councils in the Bill. We agreed with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, on this matter. We believe it is crucial that sector skills councils are involved in the drafting and issuing of the specification of apprenticeship standards because they are an important intermediary which will represent the needs of industry. Their involvement would, therefore, help to ensure that apprenticeships are kept to the highest standard and are relevant to employers' needs. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, we think that the Minister may have a point when he suggests that to refer to them specifically in the Bill would render it hybrid. As he said in Committee, that,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000294"></a>&#147;would require more complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedure&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0911028000204"></a>We are delighted, therefore, that the Government have taken this opportunity to consider their stance and we welcome government Amendment 15 which would mean that the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency has to consult, among others, with each of the people under Section 12 to issue apprenticeship frameworks, whom we have been assured will include the sector skills councils. We welcome this amendment which encapsulates the desire of our Amendment 38A which was discussed in Committee. We welcome the Government's intentions here and we are most grateful for all the hard work which went into finding a way to incorporate the sector skills councils and to tie them, if not as far as we would have hoped, at least more clearly into the Bill. As the Minister said in Committee:</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000295"></a>&#147;We cannot establish apprenticeship frameworks without sector skills councils&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/6/09; col. 1584.]</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000231"></a>I am a little curious that the Government have chosen to expand the role of employers and their representatives specifically only in terms of the draft specification of  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_41"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apprenticeship standards. Perhaps, in due course, he could explain why he feels their role should be limited in that way.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0911028000205"></a>We are also grateful that the drafting of the Government's amendments means that they include a wider framework. We think it is important, for example, that pan-sector skill organisations such as those to do with business or administration are not left out of the consultation and that their involvement is very important. Perhaps there are other ways of including them, even with a further defined role for the sector skills councils in the Bill. That deserves some thought.</p>

<a name="91102-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0911028000206"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, would attempt to push that further. These amendments use the same formula to bring the sector skills councils, employers and their representatives into other areas of the Bill. We are in favour of a demand-led and employer-led approach to education, training and skills. To achieve that in the most appropriate and sensible fashion, employers must be involved in the process. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response with interest.</p>

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="0911028000207"></a><b><a name="91102-0006.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="0911028000465"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, I must admit that I am finding it difficult to cope with this cornucopia of welcome and delight. I only hope that it will continue throughout Report. The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was a sharp amendment and the Sharp amendment. The noble Baroness takes my point. It is not only in the specification of standards in England that we see employer consultation as relevant. We have referred specifically to a consultation with the sectors skills councils and others on the specification of apprenticeship standards in England because of its overwhelming importance. They will be consulted, as I said, on all other aspects of the Skills Funding Agency, and on National Apprenticeship Service activities. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, about the importance of demand-led apprenticeships. We are trying to convince employers about the vital importance of apprenticeships. I believe that I have answered all the questions raised by noble Lords.</p>

The aim here is to ensure that schools provide information about apprenticeships to all pupils, alongside other education and training options for 16 to 18 year-olds. I am grateful to noble Lords for an extremely productive and thought-provoking debate on careers education in Committee, and particularly to my noble friends who were in their place earlier on. This signalled what I identified as a determination, which we all share, to ensure that every pupil has access to a wide range of information about all the options available to them at the age of 16, to allow them to make informed choices about their future.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0911028000209"></a>However, noble Lords expressed doubts about the extent to which this requirement was made explicit to schools by the careers education clause in this Bill. We have listened very carefully to those concerns. This was always a question of drafting rather than intention. I hope noble Lords will agree that the new clause contained in Amendment 22 will address those concerns and make it absolutely clear to schools that they have a legal duty to ensure that every child receives information about apprenticeships. The new clause, which would replace Clause 36, introduces a requirement on schools, when providing a programme of careers education, to ensure that the programme includes information on options available in respect of education or training for 16 to 18 year-olds, and specifically information on apprenticeships, which was the issue that noble Lords were concerned about.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0911028000210"></a>The new clause will amend Section 43 of the Education Act 1997. That section was previously amended by the Education and Skills Act 2008 to require schools to provide careers information in an impartial manner and give advice that promotes the best interests of pupils. Nothing that we are doing through the new clause will alter or undermine that legislative position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0911028000211"></a>We also took powers in the Education and Skills Act 2008 to issue statutory guidance on careers education, which was published on 26 October. That sets out the core information which all young people should receive on post-16 learning options. That includes extensive information on apprenticeships, including the benefits of taking an apprenticeship, wage returns and apprenticeship sector progression to higher education&#151;a very important issue raised in Committee&#151;as well as information about employment opportunities available locally.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0911028000212"></a>On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will agree that their concerns have been addressed and that the new clause sends a clear message to schools that an apprenticeship is a good route for many and cannot be discounted when schools are considering which route might be best for their pupils.

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_44"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="0911028000296"></a>&#147;11 noble Lords have put their names to amendments that in one way or another ask that Clause 35 repeat the requirement that information about apprenticeships should be given to all young people, not only those for whom it is in their best interests&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/6/09; col. 1634.]</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000232"></a>We are pleased that the Government have taken those objections on board and have returned with a clause that meets those concerns.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0911028000214"></a>We have cited these statistics before, but it is worth calling on them again. The 2008 YouGov poll on this issue showed that only 24 per cent of teachers felt that apprenticeships were a good alternative to A-levels. In contrast, 55 per cent of employers and 52 per cent of young people felt that they were just as good an option. It is important that pupils do not miss out on advice regarding both vocational and academic options. We are delighted that the Government have accepted the argument here and tabled amendments conceding that point&#151;accepting that our approach, and that of so many around the House, is more appropriate.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0911028000215"></a>However, we on these Benches feel that the clause still represents a missed opportunity. It is no secret that we feel that about many parts of the Bill. Nevertheless, in this context, I shall concentrate on the careers service. The Government propose amendments to the Education Act that would ensure that the provision of a programme of careers education includes information on education, training and apprenticeships. They have not, however, taken the opportunity to make statutory and effective changes to the careers education system.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0911028000216"></a>As things stand, in about two-thirds of schools in England, careers advice is given by teachers with no professional qualification in the field. Further advice may come from the Connexions service, which replaced the careers service in 2001. Although Connexions can provide useful services and advice, a recent study by the Skills Commission has shown that,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000297"></a>&#147;there has been a decline in the quality of careers advice since Connexions replaced the Careers Service&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0911028000217"></a>Moreover, the Government's own new guidance paper, <I>Quality, Choice and Aspiration&#151;A Strategy for Young People&#146;s Information, Advice and Guidance</I>, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="0911028000298"></a>&#147;there is evidence to suggest that the quality of IAG&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0911028000233"></a>information, advice and guidance&#151;&#147;varies quite considerably&#148;. Again, the Government&#146;s guidance cites a recent online study by the British Youth Council, the National Children's Bureau, and Young NCB, which found that only just under 20 per cent of respondents rated the formal career advice they received as &#147;very helpful&#148;. Although the Connexions service has achieved many good things, it clearly needs improving radically. Some of the difficulty may be that Connexions is expected to provide such a wide range of advice over such a wide remit, from health to relationship advice, to money and housing. Connexions has the capacity to give very good careers advice, but one wonders if it is spread too thin.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09110227000001"></a>In response to these difficulties the Government&#146;s new guidance paper suggests reviews, consultations and task forces. We therefore feel that this Bill, and indeed this guidance, has missed an opportunity to reinvent careers advice. These amendments go some way to reassuring noble Lords that the advice given  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_45"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be impartial between academic and vocational careers paths. Nevertheless, they do not get to the heart of the matter, which would be to improve careers advice specifically. In contrast to these reviews and task forces and promises to look at the problems which mean that under 20 per cent of the survey respondents feel that the advice they received was &#147;very helpful&#148;, we on these Benches have said clearly that we would change the system. There is a call for a professional, impartial careers adviser in every secondary school and college. Teachers should not be saddled with the extra burden of having to provide advice on careers. A fully trained and qualified professional body should offer young people all the help they need. Indeed, we would also institute a new and professional all-age careers advice service that would provide community-based sources of advice and guidance for people of all ages. In this way there would be a revolution in the way that people give and receive advice on the options available to them.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09110227000002"></a>We are delighted to accept the Government&#146;s concessions, but we feel that while these amendments help to prevent further dangers to careers advice which the ambiguous old Clause 36 could have brought in, they do not go nearly far enough.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="09110227000003"></a><b><a name="91102-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110227000230"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Ministers and the Bill team for all the discussions that we have had on these various clauses. Although the Bill does not address careers education in great detail, as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has set out, we welcome the fact that Amendment 222 is considerably clearer than the old Clause 36 and that it puts apprenticeships as an option worthy of equal consideration.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09110227000004"></a>In considering these amendments we are mindful of the strategy document <I>Quality, Choice and Aspiration</I>, which the Minister mentioned, because a key to many people&#146;s engagement in school is that at an early stage they can see relevance in learning and can gain confidence in their proficiency and raise their aspirations. I note from the impact assessment document that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110227000026"></a>&#147;it is about much more than this. It is about exciting young people about their future lives and it is about raising their aspirations about what they can achieve&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110227000021"></a>Those who fail to make that connection very often become bored and frustrated, and that leads to difficulties later in life. We welcome the strategy proposals of personal tutors and taster sessions of HE and the workplace, and that by September 2010 there will be</p>
<ul><a name="09110227000027"></a>&#147;in every institution a member of the leadership team appointed with responsibility for IAG&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09110227000005"></a>That document expresses the importance of careers education in a way that is lacking in this Bill. We felt an opportunity had been lost in the Bill to support the careers service more effectively, but we very much support the clear intentions in these Government amendments as a step in the right direction and we thank the Minister for bringing them forward.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_46"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lords have a great deal of interest in careers education and I know that there is a debate about how we should take careers education forward. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, welcomes our strategy, but I would say to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that the strategy is quite a bit more than task forces and reviews. We are putting significant investment into it. I have sheaves of notes advising me about the &#163;10 million IAG support fund which will take the form of grants to support innovative projects that respond to the needs of young people and parents for impartial advice; and that the money will be made available through youth sector development funds. It is a hugely important debate.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09110227000007"></a>I thank noble Lords for recognising that we have listened to them on the amendments. We are 100 per cent committed to ensuring that children and young people get really strong careers advice. It is important that teachers, lead teachers and governors, indeed the whole schools sector, are fully involved in that, and that the Connexions service is properly connected. There are variations in the quality of service, as the strategy recognises, although we differ with the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, on the question of having one service for all ages. I appreciate the support that noble Lords have given to these amendments.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09110227000009"></a>In addition to the listed permissible grounds to refuse study or training, the Institute of Directors proposes that a valid refusal could be that there had been a documented discussion of training needs, resulting in a decision whether to extend such provision to the applicant, in the previous 12 months. This is based on evidence from its members, the majority of whom already use regular performance reviews or appraisals to manage performance and training requirements. In businesses where this is in place, the IoD argues that these discussions should be the preferred time when employees make their requests, thereby enabling businesses to manage the process of training allocation fairly. This would benefit employers and employees by reinforcing good practice and encouraging employers to discuss and to document training needs at least annually.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09110227000010"></a>Many businesses, as we know, have a limited amount of time off for training that they can offer staff. Being able to consider all staff training requests together

Employees would also see it as a fairer system.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09110227000011"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lady Sharp expressed the concern that the training needs of younger people, the 16 to 18 year-olds, might change more rapidly and that a review might be required within 12 months. That group should, in any event, be involved in a structured training programme. This amendment would not prevent training needs being reviewed more frequently but would increase the incentive for both sides to make a longer-term assessment of what will benefit the individual and the organisation. I beg to move.</p>

We tabled similar amendments in Committee, to which the Minister responded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09110227000025"></a>&#147;Time to train goes with the grain of what the best employers are already doing&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/6/09; col. 53.]</p>

<p><a name="09110227000022"></a>In the light of this, perhaps he will have some sympathy for this amendment, which would complement the time-to-train provisions while ensuring that employers are protected.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09110227000013"></a>This amendment comes from the Institute of Directors, of which I disclose that I am a member, and is designed to reflect the fact that many employers already have regular and successful employment appraisals in which training needs can be discussed. Figures from the IoD show that 88 per cent of its members already use,</p>
<ul><a name="09110227000028"></a>&#147;regular performance reviews or appraisals to review and manage employees' performance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110227000023"></a>Does the Minister agree that if an employer has these sessions in place, this would be the appropriate time to raise any requests for training?</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09110227000014"></a>While we agree with the principle that employees should have the right to request time to train, we do not want this to become an onerous burden on employers. It seems particularly inappropriate that the burden should fall on employers who have already put effort into organising regular training discussions with their employees. Moreover, as we have already heard, such organised training discussions have the added bonus of ensuring that employers can ensure the fairness of the allocation of granted requests for time off to train.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09110227000015"></a>We ought to encourage employers who have shown the initiative to extend these provisions to their employees on a voluntary basis, on the grounds that the more they help to improve the skills of their staff the more successful their business can become. We should not instead tie them to statutory provisions that are imposed from without and that might hinder the efficient operation of business and training rather than help it. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_48"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employers with an additional reason to refuse a request made under new Section 63D of the Employment Rights Act 1996 where they have discussed and reached a decision on an employee&#146;s training needs in the previous 12 months. While I recognise the intention to minimise the burden on the best employers who already have processes in place to discuss their employees&#146; training needs, I do not believe that the amendment proposed would serve that intention. It could allow some employers who do not take their training responsibilities seriously to hide behind inadequate training policies and processes, and reject legitimate requests out of hand.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09110227000017"></a>Our clear intention in establishing the new right is to reflect what the best employers are doing. I fully expect employers who are already engaging in a regular, systematic and meaningful dialogue with their employees about their skills needs to receive far fewer requests under these provisions than those employers who are not yet taking skills and training seriously. Furthermore, the legislation as we have proposed it&#151;without this amendment&#151;gives the best employers ample reasons to turn down requests that they receive where they consider they must do so for sound business reasons.</p>

<a name="91102-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09110227000018"></a>I said in Committee that after the new provisions have been in force for a year, we will carry out a review, with stakeholders, to examine whether we need to augment the list of reasons for employers to refuse a request. So, we have recognised the need for a review process. Since Committee stage we have announced that we plan to phase the introduction of these provisions to give businesses with fewer than 250 employees an extra year to prepare for their introduction. I am happy to commit today that we will complete that review and consider its conclusions before extending the new right to all qualifying employees in 2011.</p>

We shared all the feelings expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. The wording was misleading and could lead some local authorities not to spend what they ought to be spending on those with special educational needs. We are delighted to see the eradication of that wording from all parts of the Bill, and we are grateful to Ministers for ensuring that that will happen.</p>

This is clearly a very acceptable amendment, which was before us previously and which has been redrafted. I stress that the amount of money that may need to be spent on those with special educational needs can be well and truly justified when we look at some of the ways that young people with these sorts of needs can turn out, costing the state a great deal more. If one were doing it purely on the basis of the bottom line, it is money very well spent.</p>

Will they please go back to their various departments and ensure that the wording that stirs up this sort of hornets&#146; nest unnecessarily never appears again? As those of us who have been involved in these processes over many years know, that is not the intention of many Governments in their legislation on education.

I hope that everyone will pay attention to this type of get-out clause, which has been used in the past and will be used again. People will try to duck their duty if something does not fit into their spending plans, is unexpected and is not accounted for, or is not understood. That has happened in the past and will happen again. We must make sure that there is less wriggle-room for people to try to get out of a duty that has been accepted by Parliament and everyone involved. If we draft this provision again and it is debated on a day when we are not quick enough to spot it, it will lead to no end of trouble and ultimately a great deal of litigation.</p>

We have been through these points before so I shall not dwell on them unnecessarily. We feel, however, that it is most important that the Government take these points on board and, we hope, find sympathy with our view. I should state now that the amendments tabled by the Government do not meet our concerns.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09110229000013"></a>Clause 77 allows the Secretary of State to require the YPLA to enter into arrangements with the Secretary of State. These arrangements may require the YPLA to carry out specified functions of the Secretary of State in relation to academies, city technology colleges   


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_53"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and city colleges for the technology of arts. In previous debates we have spoken about how inappropriate it is for the YPLA to take responsibility for these arrangements. The YPLA is a body set up to support and enable local authorities to carry out their new responsibilities. It is not set up to play any part in the role of academies.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09110229000014"></a>We accept that perhaps it is time to give some thought to the future of the academy movement. The success of these schools means that it has become rather cumbersome to keep them housed in the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Nevertheless we feel that due thought and care should be taken on where to move them. We should not just give into a knee-jerk impulse which may not be the most appropriate solution. Instead, much care and consideration must be given to the most appropriate solution and I do not believe that that has been found yet. A body that ties academies into local authorities and which deals specifically with education for people between 16 and 19 is not appropriate. First, academies thrive on their independence and freedom from local authorities. Secondly, the age range of academies is most commonly 11 to 18, and some even have primary schools attached.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09110229000015"></a>We contend that there has been a lack of thought. That is underlined when one considers that there was no discussion with academy sponsors when the Government&#146;s White Paper was published last year. Now I am informed by academy groups that they are being called in and asked for their views. That is to be applauded but it is rather too little too late. We are told that discussions are based around decisions that have already been taken and that only the details are up for consideration. The Minister has expressed concern that the DCSF is no longer the right place for academies. If the main worry is really about the best positioning for an academy, from its perspective, then one must ask why these groups were not consulted earlier. From these discussions, we have also been informed that the Government have found groups of academies that actively favour the proposals. I wonder whether the Minister could cite those bodies, as we have heard nothing of that kind and I would be interested to hear details of those discussions.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09110229000016"></a>The Minister has attempted to reassure us here with government amendments, and I do not expect that she tabled those with much hope of our agreement. I am afraid that I will not disappoint her in that respect. Government Amendment 70 has been tabled to ensure that the Secretary of State, when appointing members to the board of the YPLA, must have regard to the fact that they should have,</p>
<ul><a name="09110229000060"></a>&#147;experience relevant to ... the full range of ... YPLA ... functions, and ... any functions that may be conferred or imposed on the YPLA under Academy arrangements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110229000045"></a>I wonder whether the Minister thought that was an appropriate restriction to place on the Secretary of State when considering candidates for the membership of the YPLA. Surely, it is of the utmost importance that, when appointing members of the YPLA, the Secretary of State should have regard to the people who would be best or most appropriate for the job. After all, a person may have had experience but not be the best candidate for the position. Perhaps this deserves some more thought.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_54"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91102-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09110229000017"></a>The second government amendment here would restrict the functions that the YPLA can exercise with regard to academies. The amendment would ensure that, in the Bill, the &#147;academy functions&#148; that can be delegated to the YPLA do not include being able to sign funding arrangements or being able to create or confirm subordinate legislation. It also puts in place a procedure by which academies can complain to the Secretary of State. We appreciate the effort that the Government have put into their attempts to reassure us. Nevertheless, I feel that we remain unsatisfied. The government amendment introduces a channel of complaint to the Secretary of State. Academy groups are, however, afraid that this will not bring much comfort. If a group of local authorities wishes to determine the post-16 provision available, what effect will a plea from one academy have when it is weighed up against the might of an entire local authority?</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09110229000018"></a>Secondly, the Government are offering to place in the Bill a commitment that the process regarding funding commitments will not be changed, but that is not what the academy movement is worried about. Academies that are placed, even in some respect, under the YPLA will be tied to the new 14 to 19 partnerships, which are being awarded the power of commissioning to determine what places are offered and by how many places academies can expand. We are told that this changes nothing, but it does change something. Academies that have been open since September are, it is true, already tied into those partnerships, but at the moment they are few.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09110229000019"></a>As we move forward, and more and more are brought into this discussion group, it is true that the 14 to 19 partnerships will become important. However, when this Bill becomes an Act the partnerships will have increasing power and influence over commissioning and provision. We are&#151;are we not?&#151;informed that the YPLA has the responsibility for supporting local authorities which plan, commission and fund provision for young people in this area. We will therefore expect there to be further issues when that legislation is passed and the plans become solidified. The fear, however, has developed partly as a response to issues that have already occurred and problems that have already been seen.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09110229000020"></a>That is why we have chosen to table Amendment 36, which is specific to sixth-form provision. It serves, however, to demonstrate some of the difficulties that may face independent academies in the face of local authority decisions. There are records of academy groups applying to turn high schools into academies, but permission being refused on the grounds that they did not fit with the local commissioning plan for the area. Some time later, however, and the expansion from an 11 to 16 school to an 11 to 18 academy has been very successful and has produced a thriving school, with a much greater post-16 retention rate. The fear is that the YPLA will have undue influence over academies, and so tie them into local authorities and local politics. They will then be able to excuse this control as operating within their commissioning plan and as the most rational solution.</p>

Furthermore, the fact that academies are brought into struggling areas means that the expansion or development may, in fact, seem irrational. The example cited above shows that decisions can seem to be against the grain of what will work, but may then provide effective improvement to an area which, without the independent insight of an academy, might have been left struggling.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09110229000022"></a>In conclusion, I shall cite Mike Butler of the Independent Academies Association. He has stated that one reason for the success of academies is because they,</p>
<ul><a name="09110229000061"></a>&#147;turn around endemic educational underperformance in the most challenging of contexts in respect of socio-economic deprivation. To do so, it was recognised that new organisations had to be established that would be freed from the constraints of local authority control, from the old governance arrangements and from the vagaries of local bureaucracy&#148;.</ul>

We think it a very good thing that the YPLA board will be able to call upon the right spread of expertise, covering all of the areas that the YPLA will have to deal with including, of course, academies. We also thank the Government for Amendment 83, which I believe came as a result of our probing amendment in Committee. It is now quite clear that the YPLA will not be able to enter into funding agreements, or to propose or confirm subordinate legislation. We also welcome the complaints procedure for academies against possible mismanagement by the YPLA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09110229000024"></a>On academies, I am afraid that we have a diametrically opposed opinion to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. We have a completely different vision of academies. The noble Baroness seems to believe that their success&#151;which has in many cases been very considerable when dealing with children from the greatest deprivation&#151;comes solely from the fact that they are free from local authorities. However, I believe that it might just have something to do with their ability to attract the best leaders and teachers, having shiny new schools with extremely good facilities, having freedom to innovate and, of course, having parents who take a great interest in the children&#146;s education because they have chosen to send them there.</p>

<a name="91102-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09110229000025"></a>Our view of academies is quite different; in the Liberal Democrat world, we would even call them something different. We would call them sponsor-managed schools, and we would have local authorities having strategic oversight over them. They would be able to commission appropriate sponsors with the right expertise to set up and manage academies, but they would be able to ditch them after 10 years&#151;or whatever time limit we would put on them&#151;if they were not delivering the goods. We would make sure that there was no unfair selection, that all schools had the freedom to innovate and that they would be funded fairly and consistently. We would also insist on community use of the facilities, although I am not suggesting that academies do not make their facilities available to the local community, when they often do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09110229000026"></a>Unfortunately, we have had the situation where, up until now, the DCSF has become the largest local authority in the country, because it has been dealing with so many schools managed directly from the centre. There is, of course, a danger that the YPLA will now become the largest education authority in the country. However, we have had some useful discussions with Ministers and with the future head of the YPLA about how the YPLA will address its task. We are convinced that although what the Government propose is not, by any stretch of the imagination, our ideal it is somewhat nearer to our ideal of how the community and the local authority should interact with academies. I am therefore afraid that we are not in a position to support the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. As I say, when academies join the YPLA, we shall watch very carefully to see how well that works. We hope that local authorities will be consulted about the operation of academies at every point where legislation allows that to happen. We would like to see academies more engaged with the local family of schools than is the case at present.</p>

This is a very important debate about the future approach to the academy programme. I was pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, accepted that this was at least the right time to consider the future of the programme, and that it has been very successful. I am disappointed that the government amendments do not garner her support but we have had a great deal of feedback from academies. I shall not trade names as I do not want to miss anyone out, but we have closely consulted the academy movement. When one thinks of the original sponsors and principals, one appreciates that the academy movement is now very diverse, with academies in many stages of development. The noble Baroness may have been disappointed with the consultation in the early days but I reassure her that we are now working very closely with academies. We have an academy working group and a close dialogue is maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09110229000028"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for her support for government Amendments 70 and 83. I am pleased that she considers we are moving in the right direction. I agree with her that all noble Lords will watch very carefully how the YPLA goes forward. We will be interested to see how the YPLA manages its relationships with academies as they will be doing a very important job on behalf of the Secretary of State. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that every child in this country has the opportunity to succeed. We want every child to enjoy their childhood, achieve their full potential and to turn 18 with the knowledge, skills and qualifications which give them the best chance of success in adult life. To achieve this we know that every school must be a good school, and academies must be in that number. As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, said, academies are a success. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that some of them are a great success. I am delighted that there is such positive support in the House for the work that academies do. They are playing a pivotal role in delivering this vision for our children. The Government remain absolutely committed to academies.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09110229000029"></a>We have a hugely ambitious target of 400 academies and we need to make sure that we plan for that. As numbers grow we have to ensure that each and every academy will continue to get the support, and sometimes the challenge, that they need to deliver the best possible education for their pupils. There is consensus from all sides of the House that the status quo&#151;that is, the department continuing to deliver academy functions&#151;is not the right way to proceed now. That is why we are planning now to make sure that academies can continue to flourish in the future. We may not have talked about the regional structure of the YPLA as much as we should but it will allow quicker, more focused support based on better knowledge of local communities in which academies are working. If we adopt the YPLA approach, the challenge and support of academies will be more personalised and determined in accordance with, and proportionate to, the needs of individual academies.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09110229000030"></a>As we raise the participation age, I believe that academies will have a vital role in providing opportunities in the disadvantaged communities they serve. I believe that we are all committed to that. But to do it, academies will need to work with their local 14-19 partnership&#151;I see this as a real opportunity for academies&#151;local authority and the YPLA. The transfer to the YPLA will help them to do that. It will ensure academies have, in the YPLA, a champion working to ensure that the academy sector succeeds in improving outcomes for young people in those communities. However, the transfer to the YPLA also guards against the fragmented system we would have if one of the key providers, academies, were not part of and working within the YPLA framework. It ensures that young people will be able to access the full range of programmes that will be offered by further education, independent training providers, apprenticeships, academies and school collaborations. We are committed to work closely with sponsors and we will continue to consult them on the proposed arrangements. We have invited all the major multi-sponsors to come to the YPLA academies working group that is now meeting regularly to develop new ways of working together.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09110229000031"></a>We have also committed that we will consult each year prior to issuing a new remit letter to the YPLA to make sure we are learning the lessons and taking sponsors&#146; views on board as we go forward. We are listening carefully and we are responding in the design of the system as well as through amendments we have tabled. First, government Amendment 83 prevents the YPLA entering into a funding agreement to create an academy and making subordinate legislation relating to academies. I believe that I flagged that in Committee. Secondly, in response to issues raised by noble Lords and ongoing consultations with academy sponsors and principals, the amendment also ensures that there is a good procedure in place for academies, or others, to make a complaint to the Secretary of State if they are affected by the conduct of the YPLA. Academies will have a route of redress if they feel that the YPLA has acted unreasonably or against the principles of the remit letter. Finally, government Amendment 70 makes it clear that the Secretary of State will have a duty to ensure&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned this&#151;that the YPLA reflects the sectors and young

There is already significant academy representation on the Learning and Skills Council committee which is working to establish the YPLA and this amendment should send a clear signal of our intention to make sure that academy interests continue to be well represented.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09110229000032"></a>I recognise that some sponsors are nervous about the sixth-form commissioning process, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, suggested. Above all else, the YPLA must ensure that the needs of learners come first. I do not think that anyone can disagree with the fact that we want the best institutions to be the ones that are commissioned. That is why we cannot accept a situation where academy sixth forms are funded automatically, as set out in Amendment 36 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. However, academies often are the best providers. Those academies have nothing to fear. Local authorities cannot and will not just ignore that. If local authorities acted unreasonably in their commissioning role&#151;refusing to fund high-quality provision may well count as unreasonable&#151;they could face judicial review, as noble Lords are well aware. We also recognise, as the YPLA and local authorities do, that it can take time to achieve the desired quality in some academies, but this is not sufficient reason of itself for an academy sixth form not to be commissioned. Strategic commissioning means taking a longer term view of each provider, their trajectory, plans and intentions.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09110229000033"></a>We hear academies&#146; concerns. As I have said before, the Secretary of State will continue to decide about new academy sixth-form provision, while the YPLA will make the final decisions about the annual funding of sixth-form places and academies. This is something that I flagged up in Committee. The Secretary of State will retain responsibilities for all the decisions about all new academy provision.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09110229000034"></a>These are real safeguards against the sort of irrational commissioning that some may be concerned about. I hope very much that noble Lords will feel able to support the Government amendments and that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

How does she square that claim with Clauses 75 and 76?

It is worried about the powers contained in Clause 44, which allow local authorities the power to direct further education colleges to accept particular&#151;that is, specified&#151;students within a local authority&#146;s area. The Association of Colleges is worried, particularly in respect of safeguarding the other students and staff of a college, if it is felt that the specified student poses a risk in any way. Can the Minister inform the House what would happen in these circumstances?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09110229000039"></a>Some reassurances by the Government have already been offered. A letter to the Association of Colleges, for example, stated that the power would only be used in,</p>

<p><a name="09110229000047"></a>This, as far as it goes, is good news. However, can the Minister reassure colleges a little further? On what specific grounds will further education colleges be able to refuse to accept specific students? The Government have stated only that learning providers would not

Can the Minister expand on what that means, perhaps by giving some examples?</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09110229000040"></a>The purpose of our amendment is to give maximum flexibility to colleges to determine who to accept. We on these Benches feel that part of the reason for the success of FE colleges is that they are independent of local authority control. They have no catchment area; they have the freedom to determine which course they offer and which they do not, and the freedom to specialise in particular areas. They should be allowed to specialise and so be able to attract students from far and wide and not just be restricted to within the domain of their local education authority. In light of this, at the very least, local authorities should have to consult a further education college if they want the college to provide education or training to specified people. Otherwise this is a threat to the college&#146;s independence with regard to its admissions policy. The letter from the Government to the Association of Colleges stated that they,</p>
<ul><a name="09110229000063"></a>&#147;would certainly expect any local authority considering using the powers to consult with the governing body of the college first&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110229000048"></a>If this is the case, why should it not be on the face of the Bill? I beg to move.</p>

It seems reasonable that, should a local authority wish to place a student in a college, it should at least consult the college before placing them there. It is well known that, where there are difficult pupils, there is an informal agreement among the heads of secondary schools to the effect that, &#147;If you have one of mine; I&#146;ll have one of yours&#148;. There is a passing around of those very few pupils who are excluded from school where a fresh start is wanted.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09110229000042"></a>Now that we are raising the participation age to 18, young people will be expected to be either at school, at college or at work where they are receiving education and training, possibly as an apprentice as we were discussing earlier. However, there will inevitably be some who are expected to be in education, or find themselves placed in a college, who do not attend. As we know very well, there are many 14 and 15-year-olds who have truanted from school and, as we said when we discussed the Bill that went through this House last year, if they were truanting at 14 and 15, why should they be expected not to truant when they are 16 and 17?</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09110229000043"></a>There will be some difficult pupils, for whom local authorities will wish find a place. It is not fair on the colleges to be regarded as the dumping ground for some of these young people. It is only reasonable that they should be consulted before having to take on pupils; there should be some burden sharing among secondary schools and colleges at this point&#151;although, very often the college courses will be more appropriate for them. Colleges have an extremely good record helping those who need extra support through the additional learning support that they provide and often helping to motivate pupils who have been turned off by school, partly because they often provide more practical courses, which many of these pupils find more attractive than the more academic learning provided by schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09110229000044"></a>This is a very mild amendment. It asks only that there should be consultation before the right to require a governing body of such an institution to take on individuals is exercised. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable amendment.</p>

I have seen recently an excellent group discussion among a local authority, the principals of the colleges and the heads of secondary schools about a list of individuals who are exactly in the category of the more difficult young people, and it was a real discussion about where they would most appropriately be placed. For some young people, a college is not the right place; the atmosphere is not right and a school can cope better. It is at the level of the college and the school that the young person is known and that the offerings that can be made are best known, not at the local authority level. The local authority does not know on a day-to-day basis exactly what the needs of the young person are or about the precise nature of the different programmes that might or might not be appropriate for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09110251000002"></a>To leave it with the local authority is to make it arbitrary. It will inevitably be so, as the local authority is not composed of day-to-day educational providers. It is a bureaucratic organisation and it will properly, I suppose, wish to get young people put somewhere so that they can be taken off the books, so to speak; whereas at the level of the institutions concerned, a meaty discussion that meets the needs of the young person can take place.</p>

It seems like a small amendment, but it is quite a crucial issue for the institutions concerned. The Association of Colleges feels strongly about this, but so do many schools. There is a need to have some independence and some discussion at the institutional level about the best way to deal with very difficult young people.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, it is a very mild requirement and one which I would have thought is necessary in every instance where you are going to be placing children who have particular needs. I think we are agreed that this group of children would be of considerable concern to both the schools and the colleges that we are referring to.

I congratulate the Conservative Government on taking it through; it was my suggestion, so I must congratulate them. I also congratulate the Labour Government on spending so lavishly on FE colleges. They have built absolutely marvellous FE colleges. However, that is the past. It will not happen again. No local authority will give Birmingham City Council &#163;100 million to build Matthew Boulton further education college. No local authority in Teesside will give Middlesbrough &#163;120 million to build Middlesbrough college. No; when FE colleges funding goes partly back under local authorities, there will be a substantial reduction in investment in FE colleges. That is as true as anything. Local authorities will find it much more attractive to build primary schools and nursery schools than to fund further education. That is the flaw at the very centre of the Bill. I hope that any incoming Government will unravel it and fundamentally change it.</p>

But this Bill puts the situation back. I will give the House one example. Under the procedure before this Bill, FE colleges went to one funding agency&#151;the Learning and Skills Council. That is in the dock now because it overspent extravagantly, and it is being abolished. In the future, local colleges will go to four funding agencies: to the Skills Funding Agency, to HEFCE, to the YPLA, which is being set up by this body, and to the apprenticeship scheme. Instead of going to one, they will go to four, at a time when expenditure in this area is bound to be restrained. Each one of those funding bodies will be told that it has less to spend in the future than it spends now. They have lots of other responsibilities too. How will further education get a good share of that cake? Not only should this amendment be accepted; there should also be much more fundamental change. That is now virtually impossible to do with this Bill. It will not function successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09110251000008"></a>The Ministers have been incredibly kind in explaining the Bill right at the last minute. We have all had these letters every other day explaining how the Bill is going to work. I am amazed at how the Bill got through the Commons without these explanations, and to some extent the Government have been making it up as they go along. I do not blame the Ministers. They are merely the custodians of a very ill thought-out policy, and they have done their best to explain it. The Bill is deeply flawed and it will not improve further education in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09110251000011"></a>Clause 44 gives local authorities powers to require an institution within the FE sector to provide education to a named individual aged 16 or over but under 19, which is currently a power held by the Learning and Skills Council. We expect that this power will be exercised extremely rarely. However, in the handful of cases where a young person has been turned away from all possible learning options, someone needs to be able to step in to secure them a place.</p>

<a name="91102-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09110251000012"></a>This is not about local authority control over providers. A local authority&#146;s primary concern will be to secure the best possible learning option for the young person&#151;and there are a number of considerations they will need to take into account, including the individual needs of the young person in question, as well as the needs of any providers that are being considered. In order to balance those needs, the local authority would naturally need to enter into a consultative dialogue with the young person, the Connexions service and all possible providers to determine the most suitable option for the young person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09110251000013"></a>In response to the amendment tabled by noble Lords opposite, I can commit today that we will include this requirement to have a consultative dialogue in statutory guidance to local authorities. However, I sense the mood of the House, and I have listened to concerns expressed by noble Lords. We fully intend for there to be a consultative dialogue between local authorities and providers. However, I understand the arguments that have been put forward and I commit to return to the issue at Third Reading, taking those points into account.

I should like to talk now about literacy and numeracy assessments and to speak to the other government amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09110251000018"></a>Government Amendments 44, 45, 47, 49 and 50 relate to Clause 49 as regards reading assessments for young offenders, a provision which was inserted in Committee. The amendments make four changes as a result. First, they extend the requirement to cover literacy and numeracy skills in the assessment beyond that originally envisaged. This is more of the &#147;what&#148; that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, advocated in Committee, which we need to be more clear about. Secondly, the amendments require that the assessments be used to help determine learning plans. Thirdly, they stipulate that if a recent assessment is available, a reassessment should not be necessary. This is about trying to include a level of proportionality in the Bill. Finally, the amendments do not include a requirement for a reassessment on release. However, if that continues to be a concern, in particular for the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Elton, I will be persuaded to return at Third Reading with a requirement to transfer information about progression on release, in order to aid resettlement. We are trying to get this right, and we are edging forward here.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09110251000019"></a>Regarding Amendment 51, on screening for special needs, we have committed in previous debates to rolling out a screening tool that Dyslexia Action has deployed in YOIs from this month. It is preferable to deal with this through guidance as it is a complex issue covering a wide spectrum of difficulties and disabilities. We hope that noble Lords will be happy with that approach.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09110251000020"></a>As regards the contents of the guidance, I appreciate that noble Lords have clearly voiced concerns that we should be specific about what we are requiring of YOIs and of education providers in the youth custody setting. I agree that courses and syllabuses are important and I can commit to include them in statutory guidance. However, the guidance-making power in new Section 18A(6) already covers all aspects of education  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_65"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision and further clarification is unnecessary, although I understand the reasoning behind noble Lords&#146; amendments.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09110251000021"></a>Amendment 55 would require the governor of youth custody establishments to assist the local authorities in fulfilling their new duties. I agree that it is important that the governor should be fully committed, and I can commit to amending the secondary legislation regulating the management of youth custodial establishments to place a clear requirement on custodial operators to co-operate with local authorities and their designated providers in the fulfilment of their education duties. This will meet the concerns that noble Lords voiced about ensuring that the role of the governor is properly maximised.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09110251000022"></a>With regard to concerns about the scope of new Section 562A and young people in adult custody, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, raised two important points in Committee. First, he was concerned that this new section, inserted by Clause 51, could be used to change the specific young offender provisions of the Bill. This is certainly not our intention, and Amendment 48 clarifies this. I hope that the noble Lord will find that helpful. Secondly, he raised concerns about the education of under-19s in adult custody, which we discussed in Committee. I can commit that we will set out administratively that the chief executive of skills funding should use his best endeavours to ensure that they receive a broadly analogous education to their counterparts in juvenile custody. That is a strong measure that I hope will satisfy the noble Lord, who is rightly concerned that people aged 18 or under in an adult setting should received the analogous education.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09110251000023"></a>I am speaking also to Amendment 134, which will require the chief executive to have regard to any learning difficulties among this age group. That is an omission and needs to be corrected. I hope that that provides the reassurance that noble Lords are looking for on those matters.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09110251000024"></a>Information transfer was a particular concern of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in his Amendments 53 and 54. Amendment 53 seeks to change to a duty the power in new Section 562E for education providers to share information. We considered whether we should place a duty on providers to share information but we concluded that that was not appropriate in the case of, for example, voluntary sector providers or even of home educators, because we would not want to create new enforcement mechanisms or penalties on such groups. That is why we did not go down that route. I hope that we can persuade the noble Lord to withdraw that amendment.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09110251000025"></a>Amendment 54, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, proposes a power to allow the host local authority to transfer educational information to the home authority or to any person responsible for providing education and training for the detained person. This is already provided for in Section 562E&#151;I apologise for all the numbers. It requires that the transfer of information must happen on request. This allows us to make this a clear duty, and therefore is stronger than the power suggested in the amendment. We are placing a duty on local authorities and have a mechanism for redress.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09110251000026"></a>I understand concerns raised in Committee that we must ensure that information sharing happens. I appreciate that noble Lords sometimes tire of Ministers saying that they are producing guidance and therefore such and such will happen. We have a strong commitment to making this information sharing happen. The YJB has a remit to monitor the secure estate, and as part of the development of new information-sharing programmes such as e-Asset, it monitors the usage of the system monthly to ensure that it is being used as intended. In addition, the YJB has undertaken one-off reviews to check that it is delivering the benefits hoped for under the new e-Asset system. It plans to continue this as it develops the system further. We will be clear in the statutory guidance that information exchange must be integrated wherever possible with the YJB&#146;s recently developed information-sharing systems, including e-Asset. This will help to make timely information sharing routine practice&#151;this is the key&#151;as well as ensuring that a person&#146;s education plans are considered in the context of their wider sentence and resettlement plans. It is about bringing together all the important elements of resettlement and sentence planning.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09110251000027"></a>Ofsted, too, will play an important role in considering young people&#146;s educational progress, and information sharing is an important part of this. As I said earlier, Amendment 43 is minor and technical, as are Amendments 56 and 61. I hope that, with the commitments that I have made and the reassurances that I have given about information sharing and the statutory guidance being clear about what we expect of the system, noble Lords will feel able to support the government amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="09110251000028"></a><b><a name="91102-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110251000385"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that, and particularly grateful for her early mention of consideration before Third Reading. This Bill has sometimes felt like a shotgun marriage, because we have been instructed to go down this route, knowing that the Learning and Skills Council has already received its demolition order. Nevertheless, it is important that we should raise all the issues right down to the wire&#151;particularly those that affect young people. I will speak to Amendments 46, 51 and 52, which refer to young people in detention. I will leave Amendment 55, which I support, to my noble friend Lord Elton.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09110251000029"></a>Amendment 46, as the noble Baroness hinted, refers to the business of what and how that I raised earlier. We are nearly at the what, but not quite there. I am confused by new subsection (6) in Clause 48, which adds the following after Section 18 of the Education Act 1996:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="09110251000130"></a>&#147;In performing the duty imposed by subsection (1), a local education authority must have regard to any guidance issued ... by the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110251000122"></a>What concerns me is that it does not state which Secretary of State. There are at least two&#151;for the Department for Children, Schools and Families and for the Ministry of Justice. When I asked the Bill Office whether it could be precise, the answer was, &#147;No, this is the language of Bills, it is just &#145;the Secretary of State&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09110251000030"></a>I am very concerned. My experience of going round the estate where this happens is that there is a lack of direction. Nobody is in charge of saying what should  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_67"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happen. Therefore there is no consistency in what happens all around the system. Surely that is what we are after. My proposal, guided by the Bill Office, was to be more specific about what guidance the local authority should have regard to. The guidance is on what is to be done&#151;what courses, what programmes, what education and for which people. Otherwise, there can be no provision.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09110251000031"></a>As the discussion on the Bill has gone on, I have become more concerned about where we are going. There is complexity after complexity. Three words have sprung to mind&#151;they say that soldiers can only think in threes, and this proves it. Two of them are German and come from the battlefield. The first is &#147;Auftragstaktik&#148;, which means &#147;mission-orientated orders&#148;&#151;in other words, everyone knows precisely where they are going, without any doubt at all. The second is &#147;Fingerspitzengef1/4hl&#148;, which means &#147;fingertip feel&#148;&#151;in other words, those who are doing the job know precisely what they ought to be doing, when and where, because the instructions are abundantly clear. The third word is a government word&#151;&#147;simplification&#148;. I see us breaking away from clarity, clouding the issue for people on the ground and getting more complicated as more organisations and methods are added to the system. This is lunatic when we are dealing with young people, particularly young people who are in touch with the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09110251000032"></a>I am also concerned that while we are talking about that in the context of a Bill coming from the education ministries, two other things are happening. One is that something called the National Standards for Youth Justice Services is being produced, in which people make comments to the Ministry of Justice. They are talking about communication problems and the fact that 60 per cent of these young people have communication difficulties. They are saying that staff need training and support to manage these people, and that if you start trying to assess their processes verbally, they tend to withdraw, not co-operate and deny problems in order to finish the processes quickly and reduce the stress. It is essential that early risk-assessment processes include identification of communication difficulties so that their impact on risk assessment can be managed.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09110251000033"></a>This issue links Amendment 46 to Amendments 51 and 52. The Minister has assured us that in statutory guidance there will be instructions on this. However, for 10 years I have been trying to impress on the criminal justice system that until and unless the communication difficulties of these youngsters are properly assessed, there is no entry to any literacy, numeracy or other assessment. The communication problem is the scourge of the 21st century. It has crept up on us and we must stop it. There has been a mass of assurance that this is going to happen&#151;this regulation and that instruction&#151;but I am cynical about this and dearly wish to see it in the Bill. People will know then what is required and can begin to cost it.</p>

<a name="91102-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09110251000034"></a>My last point is that I am very concerned that Clause 48 passes the buck of education provision for those in youth detention to LEAs. On 21 July, I handed a document called <I>Young Offenders: A Secure Foundation </I>to the Minister, Maria Eagle, in the Ministry  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_68"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Justice. It was published by the Foyer Federation and concerns the costs of youth offender institutions. It proves that the Government are consistently understating the costs of managing young offender institutions. Instead of the quoted cost of between &#163;48,000 and &#163;67,000, the true cost is &#163;100,000 a year and possibly more. Therefore, the Youth Justice Board&#146;s budget is currently &#163;120 million less than the true cost. What worries me is that when the true cost is passed to the local education authorities, they are going to find that there is not enough provision to do all the things that have to be done. This Bill is making that situation worse because it lacks any clarity as to who is to do what, other than mentioning all these new organisations which are going to assume funding responsibilities. I know I have said this over and again&#151;I have been banging on for 10 years now&#151;but I hope that at last the Government will listen and put something right which could have been put right years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09110251000036"></a>This is the only occasion on Report when we have the opportunity to debate this extraordinary proposal to transfer the education of young offenders from the Prison Service and Home Office, and now the Ministry of Justice, to local authorities. It has not been possible to know how this is going operate in practice from the actual words in the legislation, even from the Explanatory Notes.

Was it just an expletive? It was, of course, a spelling mistake. Even on page 3 they cannot get the spelling right. None of the officials or Ministers noticed it. They published it. This is absolutely typical of how this Bill has been handled throughout its progress in this House. Hardly a week has passed without two long letters from Ministers explaining how the Bill will operate. I do not blame the Ministers. They are the poor custodians of a very poor policy, and they have been given the job of trying to explain it to everybody. But this really is not the way that legislation should be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09110251000038"></a>At the heart, what is this Bill going to do? It is going to deal first with 7,000 young offenders who are admitted into custody each year. At any one time about 2,600 are actually in custody in 15 young offender institutions, four secure training centres or nine secure children&#146;s homes, and there are two more in Wales. How long do they stay there? Some only stay for a week or a few days. The average is three to four months. Some stay much longer, up to two years. So how will this Bill operate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09110251000039"></a>At the moment, these young offenders are provided with education and training by the Prison Service. This Bill gives to the local authorities where the offenders have lived, not where the institution is, a duty to promote the fulfilment of the young person&#146;s learning potential while they are in custody and on their release. How will this work? Let us suppose a young offender from Essex is sent to the young offender institution in Wigan. As one of the largest in the country, Hindley takes more than 400 young offenders. As soon as that young offender from Essex&#151;let us call him Mr Bloggs&#151;arrives in Hindley, it has to write to Essex and say, &#147;Do you know about Mr Bloggs?&#148;. Essex might find that Mr Bloggs left school at the age of 11 and that it has had no track or record of him since, and the lad may not remember the name of the school that he went to. We are dealing with these sorts of people. Wigan then has to find out how intelligent Mr Bloggs is by doing a literacy and numeracy assessment within two or three days. Then it has to try and find out what he would like to study and send that information back to Essex. Essex then has to devise an individual learning programme for this person in Wigan. That is going to involve huge bureaucracy. Can an individual learning programme for a young offender be identified and written without anybody going from Essex to Wigan to talk to that young offender? Who is going to bear the cost of that? It will be the Essex local education authority. And Essex being what it is will not have just one Mr Bloggs. It will probably have 20, 30 or 40 at any one time, not only in Wigan but in several other young offender institutions. So you are throwing a huge responsibility on local education authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09110251000040"></a>What are the difficulties in discharging that? There might be early leavers, as I have said, who played truant and bunked off at 11, 12 or 13. These young offenders might be itinerant. It might be difficult to track down where they have been educated. They might say that they last lived in Essex but were, in fact, only in Essex for two or three months and then they

When you assess what that young person needs, suppose he decides in Wigan that he would like practical training in plumbing and Wigan does not do plumbing. Suppose he wants training in some other function that the young offender institution cannot provide. If Essex says, &#147;He wants to be trained in plumbing&#148;, what are you going to do? Bring in plumbers to Wigan with all their equipment to do this? This is so utterly typically unrealistic. Suppose that young person is transferred to another young offender institution, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, knows, can be quite common. All this has to be gone through again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09110251000041"></a>You have this extraordinary dichotomy between the host local authority where the young offender institution is and the place where the offender is deemed to live. It is the host authority that has to provide the education. It has to commission the tutors or provide the teaching classes or workshops. But in order to do that, it has to speak to the Youth Justice Board, which has to approve the resources to be provided. Who will pay for those, the YJB or the host authority? Why should the host authority incur capital costs when they do not particularly want to do it? Where is the money going to come from?</p>

Who devised that policy? I cannot believe that it came from the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office or the Prison Service. Did it come from the education department&#151;the DCSF&#151;or the business or skills departments? In those days, I think business and skills were under the education department. It is clear that this has not been thought through very carefully. It is an immensely bureaucratic structure. At Third Reading, it would be sensible for the House to postpone for two years the implementation of these clauses relating to the training of young offenders aged 16 to 18. The Minister shakes her head. Read these details and understand the complexity of it. Who will pay for it? There will be an annual grant to the host authority for the provision but will that be per capita or an annual grant? If it is per capita will that allow for the prison population to go up from 2,600 to 4,000? If it is an annual grant, they could not possibly

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09110251000047"></a>Amendment 55, in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is designed to elicit from the Government the duty which the governor of an institution from which a young person is released is under. When a young person is incarcerated, how does the duty rest on the governor to see that the education, which the Bill provides in such a complicated and expensive way, is delivered? As my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will know, there are often shortages of members of the Prison Officers&#146; Association able or willing to move prisoners from one part of a prison to another. It is all very well having teachers, overhead projectors and white boards in one room in a young offender institution if all the inmates who are to benefit from it are elsewhere. Nowhere in the Bill have I seen a requirement that the governor and the host authority shall be able to discharge the functions as set out in the Bill. Nor do I see an explanation of how they shall be exempted from being in breach of the statute if they have been unable to do so because of responsibilities which lie with the Prison Service. Although the Minister may not much like the amendment, I hope she will like the opportunity to explain what will happen under those circumstances.</p>

I take the point made by the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Baker, that sometimes the length of the detail and description has been somewhat overwhelming. With the benefit of the amendments tabled, the Bill provides for improvement to procedures and systems in some cases. We welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to assessing literacy and numeracy skills when a young person begins a period in custody and we strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in his Amendment 51, which suggests that special educational needs should be assessed at the same time and that that assessment should lead to an intensive programme of learning to ensure that young people leave custody with higher levels of skills than when they entered. If they are better equipped for life and work, surely that makes sense for them personally, and it makes social and economic sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09110251000053"></a>We have listened to the arguments about assessment when young people leave custody. On the whole, we support the Government&#146;s view that repeated assessment might discourage them more and not be the most effective use of limited resources. In previous debates, we have discussed who will do the assessment and how it will be assessed. We have to recognise that assessment resources need to be targeted in the most effective way possible.</p>

The duty of liaison between host and home authorities should, most appropriately, rest with the governor and if there were a change of governor&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has raised that before&#151;the responsibility could still rest with that function and the continuity of the young person&#146;s educational programme could be assured. As the Minister said, I feel that we are edging forward in some respects with this Bill and we would support some of the government amendments proposed today.</p>

There is a tremendous difficulty in working out who is going to take responsibility when there are two Secretaries of State, plus the Ministry of Justice. Equally, the Minister has done a great job in communicating all the changes which she is trying to make to accommodate us. I also have a little sympathy with the Minister; there has been some point in trying to move the responsibility for education from the governors when, let us be honest, by no means every governor has been keen to see that the educational needs of young people in their care and custody are the first priority. Work arrangements and other priorities of governors have sometimes taken first place. I also have a sneaky feeling that, on the odd occasion, it might have been a good idea, as far as local education authorities were concerned, to see their more troublesome members paid for by another department, therefore reducing the burden of finding places and proper education for their most difficult customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09110251000056"></a>That said, I hope that the Minister can be more specific about just how far the Government are prepared to go to meet the concerns that have been expressed in these amendments, all of which I strongly support, or that we will be testing the opinion of the House on at least some of them.</p>

The Minister has brought forward a new amendment to replace ours. Barring one objection, she will be pleased to hear that we are gladly able to accept those amendments. As she has described, she has expanded the assessment so that the initial assessment will be of both literacy and of numeracy. We welcome this change, and thank the Government for having seen the merit of our amendment in such a favourable light as to expand on it.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09110251000058"></a>We also welcome the Government&#146;s intention to expand the requirement that the information from the assessments be used to help determine suitable educational provision. We also agree that if a recent assessment is available, then a further assessment should not be required. However, I ask the Minister to clarify two matters. First, how does new Section 562DA link to the provision which requires information to be taken into account when determining what constitutes suitable education? My reading of the Bill, and the amendments, suggests that it is only new Section 562E which is taken into account. I would be grateful if she would consider and clarify that.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09110251000059"></a>Secondly, can the Minister offer us some reassurance that there will be some statutory guidance in place relating to the amount of time which would be considered appropriate for it to be concluded that a further assessment was not necessary? We agree that it is important not to overassess detained people, but it would be unfortunate if subsection (3) of the new Section 562DA were to be exploited so as to render it meaningless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09110251000060"></a>I was interested to hear the Minister respond to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, before he spoke to them. His response to that response was very compelling, and we share his concerns about

My German is non-existent, but clarity of mission is essential, and my noble friend Lord Baker has rather colourfully, and I am afraid accurately, illustrated how unclear that mission is.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09110251000061"></a>We welcome in particular Amendment 52 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. While the government amendments are acceptable replacements for our own Clause 49, we feel that it remains important to have an assessment in place for when the person leaves youth accommodation, as well as when he enters it. We have taken on board the Government&#146;s concerns that a short sentence could mean that assessments were unnecessary, so we are supportive of the amendment, which requires the second assessment to occur only when the person has been detained for six months or longer. I very much hope that the Minister will look favourably on this amendment, as it reflects the concerns which were behind Amendment 124D when it was accepted by the Committee.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09110251000062"></a>Moreover, we concur with the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that the assessment should be made available to the home authority. This allows for a coherent approach to education, which should mean that progress made while in detention can be carried forward thereafter. In this light, I hope the Minister will look favourably on Amendments 53 and 54, which have been tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas. I think she said that she did. These amendments have at their heart a desire to ensure that information is provided to those detained in youth accommodation in a coherent way. The host authority, the home authority and the providers of education should all be aware of what each other has been doing and what progress has been made. It should be a duty to ensure that such a consistent approach is taken. All the good intentions which the Government have here will be to no avail if one side is not aware of what the other is doing or has achieved.</p>

In some cases, noble Lords feel that there is not enough, and in other cases that there is too much. I appreciate that noble Lords want to see detail in the Bill. That is very difficult when we are looking at the length of guidance that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, referred to, which is very draft, as he pointed out, and when we want to be specific about the &#147;whats&#148; that need to be delivered. We have to have comprehensive statutory guidance, so there is a difficult balance to strike in order to get the right detail in the Bill, but the full detail in statutory guidance, so that those in the system

I appreciate that this is a complicated Bill&#151;I do not disagree at all about that&#151;but the objective here is to ensure that young people in custody receive education which is overseen and delivered in accordance with that which they could expect if they were in the mainstream education system.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09110251000066"></a>It is about making sure that we drive up standards for young people in custody and making sure that they are not left behind. The system of information exchange is key. It is about making sure that when young people enter custody, when their sentence planning is undertaken, that information about their prior special educational needs and attainment is taken into account and that, when they leave, that information is transmitted to those who have a duty&#151;the home education authority, which is defined in statutory guidance. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is right: that must stand up to scrutiny. Those education authorities have a duty to ensure that those young people are not left behind when they come out, in resettlement, but that their education is picked up and carried on. Where there are duties to ensure that, in resettlement, young people&#146;s special educational needs are met, they must be exercised.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09110251000067"></a>I have a few detailed comments. Amendment 51 would require a full SEN assessment for every young person entering youth custody, including a repeat assessment if they were to be moved to a different establishment, or on their release. Considering that SEN statements can take 16 weeks for initial advice and 10 weeks for the actual assessment, we do not consider that to be a practical solution. That is why we think that we need to do further work. We think that it is more appropriate to put requirements for assessments of literacy and numeracy in the Bill, because they are more easily definable and quantifiable.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09110251000068"></a>To pick up on a point made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, Amendment 52 stipulates that if a recent assessment is available, a reassessment should not be necessary. Our stakeholders have made it clear to us that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, said, repeated assessment can be extremely discouraging to young people in custody, as well as being an unnecessary use of resources. We are listening very carefully to the words of advice and wisdom from the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, but we must ensure that we apply resources practically and effectively. As I said, we have made commitments to consider further and to come back at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09110251000069"></a>The Bill is about raising standards in YOIs and the secure estate for young people. As I said in Committee, the YPLA will receive funds from central government, which will be ring-fenced for the purpose. That is much more straightforward in education; the costs of the education and training provision in YOIs are already separate from the wider costs of custody, because the funding is currently being directed through the Learning and Skills Council, which holds the contracts with learning providers operating with YOIs. I offer that as reassurance to the noble Lords, Lord Baker and Lord Ramsbotham, and others who are obviously concerned about the funding streams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09110251000070"></a>As for the question of which Secretary of State is involved, I appreciate the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to ensure that we see progress for young people in custody, that there is proper joined-up government and that we deliver real improvements in education provision in the system, which is already showing significant improvement. The guidance will be joint guidance and will be signed by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and the Justice Secretary; Welsh Ministers will issue guidance for Wales. There will be clear accountability from the Secretaries of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09110251000071"></a>On the question of assessment of communication skills, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that that is key. Assessment of communication skills and disabilities in young people when they come into custody is extremely important, and they will to a large extent be picked up by the new literacy and numeracy assessments required under government Amendment 50 and&#151;this is the important point&#151;by the hidden disability screening that has already been developed by the Dyslexia Action organisation, to which we have already referred. Those important developments are taking place.</p>

I should have said that Amendments 56 to 61 are minor and technical amendments. I apologise if I have caused any confusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09110251000073"></a>On the general thrust of what I hope that this group of amendments will achieve, we are amending the reading and assessment requirement passed in Committee, so that it is now a broader requirement for literacy and numeracy assessments. I thank the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for his welcome for that. We have removed the requirement for reassessment on release. I hope that I have explained why, although we continue to listen, we believe that it would not be an effective management tool, may not apply resources in the best possible way and could demotivate young people. We will issue statutory guidance that will cover what provisions authorities should consider when commissioning education and training. That will provide the detailed guidance about what is expected and what should be delivered.</p>

<a name="91102-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09110251000074"></a>Governors will have a vital role to play in education in custody. I have here committed to amending regulations to make that absolutely clear to governors. I entirely accept the arguments made by noble Lords about the importance of that. As I have said&#151;and I apologise if it has been at length&#151;the Bill already contains strong information transfer provisions. Our statutory guidance, which will be detailed&#151;and spell checked&#151;will set out how that should work in practice. We intend that to be linked to both current planned information transfer systems within the youth justice system&#151;which, I can reassure noble Lords, are strong and good&#151;with the introduction of the new e-assets system.</p>

As my noble friend Lady Garden said, we share the Minister&#146;s hesitation about too much assessment. Nevertheless, during the educational process of those young people, a lot of testing&#151;what teachers call diagnostic testing&#151;takes place. I take it that she is suggesting that when they leave detention, a report should be issued by whoever has been providing that education, giving some assessment of what has been achieved in educational terms during the period of detention, based on the diagnostic testing that will have taken place. Am I right?</p>

As she says, a considerable amount of assessment goes on, which is captured through the individual learner&#146;s report. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said earlier, it is so important that that information transfer is properly undertaken and that the home education authority receives it on resettlement. It is that authority&#146;s duty to ensure that that young person&#146;s special educational needs and requirements are met on release.</p>

Many of us are concerned. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, pointed out that many young offenders will slip between those two authorities. Making the system work is not just about the transfer of information, which is what these amendments are about. It is a whole Byzantine structure of administration involving not two bodies, but about a dozen bodies. Who actually thought up this scheme?</p>

It would be disingenuous of me to identify one particular person who may have been responsible for developing this policy. We are talking here about applying education law to young people in young offender institutions and giving them equal opportunity to have access to the same standards of education. The feedback we have had from those involved in delivering education to young people in these settings is that it is a great opportunity for them to be able to work with the education providers around them and to be part of an education community and to drive up standards for young people, which is what I think all of us hope to achieve.</p>

I am particularly grateful for the offer that she made in her opening and closing statements to return to Amendments 51 and 52 at Third Reading, suggesting that she might be able to amend them. In a way, that takes some of the wind out of the sails of these things. The fact that she is prepared to do this demonstrates her realisation that all around this House is a sincere concern that we are in danger of passing legislation that would not do as well as it ought for those covered by the Bill.</p>

I accept that and I hope that during the dialogue we can discuss the proven test done by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. This was trialled in young offender establishments for two years and, as I have said many times in the House, was reported by the University of Surrey. It has also been successfully repeated by the Probation Service in Leeds with people under intensive supervision orders. It is quick and effective and although it is not 100 per cent detailed&#151;you will never get 100 per cent&#151;it identifies all the problems that we are looking at under the heading of learning difficulties and learning disabilities. As far as the Auftragstaktik, I think it is essential to have in the Bill something on which the statutory guidance can be based.

As noble Lords will be aware, we are committed to ensuring that local post-16 transport arrangements work in the interests of young people and adult learners. I am grateful to noble Lords for their contribution to our work in this area and in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Low, who is in his place, and to colleagues at Skill for their assistance.

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09110251000091"></a>At the Committee stage I also made a commitment to consider further how to make a link between the local authority commissioning duty in Clause 41 and the sixth form and adult transport duties so that local authorities do not consider their transport arrangements, particularly for those aged 19 to 24 with learning difficulties and disabilities, in isolation from their new responsibilities for commissioning education and training provision. It is about linking these provisions. We are moving government Amendments 62 and 63 to make these links. Government Amendments 64 and 66 are technical and consequential amendments. I hope that noble Lords will agree that these amendments address the concerns raised in Committee and will further improve the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

As the House will be aware, necessary transport to enable learners with learning difficulties and disabilities aged over 19 and under 25 to attend a course for which they already have funding has been a vexed question for some time. Skill: National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, in which I declare my interest as president, argued for a duty to be placed on local education authorities to provide transport for disabled learners aged over 19 and under 25 who are pursuing a course of education or training at an institution of further education but who, on account of their disability, cannot use public transport or access private transport to attend the course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09110251000093"></a>We had already made considerable progress in Committee. Indeed, a correspondent wrote to me after our debate to say that, &#147;It was great to read the <I>Hansard</I> of Monday&#146;s debate and see how far you&#146;d got them to move on transport&#148;. I am not sure that I would have put it like that because the Government deserve as much credit as I do for the way that they have listened to the argument. He went on to describe the progress made as a classic example of how to secure effective change within the system, and we would all probably agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09110251000094"></a>The good news does not end there. In Committee, as the Minister has said, we asked for a further small change to the wording of the transport duty in Clause 57 to align it with the general duty on local authorities in Clause 41 to provide enough suitable education and training to meet the reasonable needs of persons in their area of post-school age and under 19, or aged 19 to 25 in the case of those with learning difficulties and disabilities. We also asked for the production of guidance to support the duty and give advice on how to implement it. The amendments that the Minister has introduced deliver both these things, and the Government are to be congratulated on having moved so significantly and responded so comprehensively to the case that has

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09110251000095"></a>It may be a small crumb of comfort to the Government in the face of the broadsides that other aspects of the Bill sustained before the dinner break, but, given what has been achieved with regard to transport for disabled people, I cannot do other than extend a warm welcome to the amendments.</p>

We fully support what the noble Lord, Lord Low, has just said; we are delighted that the Government have accepted the suggested amendment to ensure that students with disability have the same right of complaint about transport issues as 16 to 18 year-olds.</p>

<a name="91102-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09110251000097"></a>Concerns were voiced that the proposals seemed to link commissioning to transport, as the Minister has indicated, with the intention that local authorities, when drawing up their transport policies, would have regard to the provision that they had already commissioned. The concern was that in reality it would happen the other way round, so that when local authorities commissioned provision they would do so on the basis of transport availability and cost, which could have the effect of limiting student choice. In the Explanatory Notes there is mention of new Clause 15ZA(1), which refers to the duty to secure education. Will the Minister confirm that the measures also include factors such as location and times of that provision, and thereby confirm that student choice will not be curtailed as a result of these amendments? I thank her, though, for the amendments that the Government have brought forward.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09110251000101"></a>Our amendments fall into two groups. Amendments 67 and 74 both raise issues of equity. Amendment 67 asks that young people who have been receiving free school meals should get free lunches at college. We feel that it is not right that their counterparts who stay on at school and who have been receiving free school meals remain eligible, whereas those who choose to move on to college lose their entitlement. Often those who move on to college come from more disadvantaged homes and choose to leave school and go to college to pursue different careers or because they find the college atmosphere more conducive than school.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09110251000102"></a>This becomes a bigger problem with the raising of the participation age because many more young people who are now leaving school and going into work will continue within an education framework and will choose to go to college. Therefore, we will probably find a considerable increase in the number of young people who, having been eligible for free school meals when they were at school, go on to college and lose that eligibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09110251000103"></a>In responding to a similar amendment in Committee the Minister cited the fact that these young people are entitled to educational maintenance allowances and that their families also receive child benefit and child tax credits. But so do those who stay on at school, so there is nothing to offset the inequity. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, who is not in his place, asked me in Committee how much it would cost. I promised to find out, and the estimate from the AoC is that the numbers involved would be approximately 95,000 young people at a total cost of something like &#163;33 million. It is a not insubstantial sum, but nevertheless it is only one-third of the budget that goes to the LSIS each year. In terms of priorities, this is considerable.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09110251000104"></a>We recognise that in these economic times it is a considerable sum for the Exchequer to swallow. The Government also said in their response that the issue was among those being considered in the review of the financing of 16 to 19 year-olds. We ask that the Government give a firm commitment in this review that the disparity between those attending college and those staying on at school will be specifically addressed. Per student it amounts to something like &#163;225 a year. Why should our more disadvantaged young people not receive that advantage when they could do so? This issue must be specifically addressed within that review rather than merely being one of the items on the agenda that, in the end, fails to be considered. It is unfair to the students and unfair to the colleges which currently have to use their hardship funds to help those obviously needy young people who cannot meet their needs in any other way. The first issue of inequity is that of free meals.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09110251000105"></a>Amendment 74 refers to the funding gap between the amount received by colleges per student and that received per student in sixth form. In 2005 the then Secretary of State, Ruth Kelly, promised to close the gap by 2010. As the Minister pointed out when we discussed this in Committee, the Government have reduced the gap from 14 per cent to about 6 per cent. The best he could do was to promise that the gap would get no bigger. Again, we argue that this is just not good enough. The college sector takes some of the most disadvantaged young people and with the raising of the participation age it will play a crucial role in delivering that Government&#146;s skills agenda. It is totally unfair that the college sector should be expected to do this on the basis of less money per student than their counterparts&#151;young people in sixth form in schools.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09110251000106"></a>Again, we are looking for an assurance about the actual gap, as the work done for the Learning and Skills Council by KPMG, and published in March 2008, made that somewhat larger than the Minister stated. Although the gap had come down when measured in 2005 terms, it pointed out that while there was a 3 per cent difference in funding rates as such, there were additional differences relating to teacher pension grants paid to schools, equivalent to a 2.61 per cent bonus per student, and additional teacher pay grants&#151;teachers in secondary schools are often paid more than college lecturers&#151;worth 3.98 per cent per student. The total gap in those KPMG figures for the LSC was 9.6 per cent for the academic year 2008-09&#151;and that conclusion did not take account of the fact that colleges   


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_87"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to pay VAT on standard supplies and services and, in addition, are expected to make a 40 per cent contribution to their capital costs.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09110251000107"></a>All told, then, the Association of Colleges reckons that the gap is somewhat larger than the 6 per cent that the Minister spoke about. Nevertheless, since nobody really denies the existence of the gap, we are really looking for an assurance that by 2013, for example, when the raising of the participation age takes effect, the gap will have been closed. It is no good assuring us that the gap will not increase, because it is grossly unfair that it exists at all. We want a firm commitment that the gap will be abolished and that the funding per student, whether they are at a further education college or in a school sixth form, is equivalent.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09110251000108"></a>Amendment 75 asks, again, that the functions of the YPLA as explained in the briefing papers that have been issued to us should be written into the Bill. This amendment differs in two respects from that discussed in Committee. First, subsection (b) of the proposed new clause refers to the development of a regional skills strategy, and for the need for the YPLA to,</p>
<ul><a name="09110251000174"></a>&#147;work with the relevant regional, sub-regional and local authorities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09110251000127"></a>in helping to develop analyses and plans to meet local needs. That arises directly from the discussions that we have had relating to the letter from the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, at the end of July to Jim Brathwaite at SEEDA. In that letter, it became clear that it was intended that the RDA would lead the development of the regional skills strategy, which,</p>
<ul><a name="09110251000175"></a>&#147;would constitute an investment plan that would become funding on the Skills Funding Agency&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09110251000109"></a>Any regional skills strategy has to consider 16 to 19 year-olds, not just those over 19, whether at school, in college, in apprenticeships or working and training. Will the regional skills strategy be binding on the YPLA, and what role will the YPLA play in helping to formulate that strategy? Originally, the idea was that the YPLA would be just a light-touch authority, distributing funds to local authorities and working with them and their sub-regional groupings to ensure that they had appropriate data, and so forth, on which to plan. Now, it seems that the RDA has usurped that role. Is that really so? What role are the RDAs going to play in relation to the YPLA?</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09110251000110"></a>The other difference in this amendment is subsection (e), its final one, which gives the Secretary of State the power to change the functions of the YPLA as he may direct. This meets the objection which I know always arises from parliamentary counsel that detailed functions written into a Bill make it impossible to change the functions of an organisation. Perhaps I might reiterate: the functions as described in this proposed new clause are taken almost word for word from the briefing papers that we have received about the YPLA. Essentially, we feel that if this is what they are going to do, it ought to be stated in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09110251000111"></a>Finally, Amendment 80 is at the request of the AoC, representing its attempt to provide for itself a means of short-cutting the bureaucracy and appealing directly to the YPLA, should the complex machinery for agreeing grants between colleges and LEAs break  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_88"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>down. I described in Committee the seven-step process that such an agreement needs, and the fears of colleges that with agreement needed from so many intermediaries, it would be impossible to meet budget deadlines. I do not intend to repeat the saga although I think it is very impressive, but given all the complications surely it is reasonable for colleges to be able to go direct to the YPLA to seek to speed things along. I said in Committee that I thought it was a very mild amendment. I urge the Government to meet its demands.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09110251000112"></a>Government Amendments 69, 70, 71 and 72 all apply to Schedule 3 and meet our request in Committee that the YPLA should have a minimum of 10, not six, members, and in particular should have members representing the full range of the YPLA responsibilities. Amendments 71 and 72 relate to the appointment of the chief executive of the YPLA. We had asked that after the first appointment, the CEO should be appointed by the board itself on conditions set by the YPLA, although those should all be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. These amendments meet precisely these demands and we are very grateful to the Government for listening to our requests. I beg to move.</p>

That was a useful concept when the gap was much larger and it could be seen that it was so substantially unfair that that crude measure could be accepted. Now that it is much closer, we have to move to something finer. We ought to base our assessment not on fairness to colleges, or indeed anyone else, but fairness to students. We ought to assess the student experience of doing the same course in a school or in a college. There should be no reason why a student doing an A-level in a college should suffer markedly worse conditions than a student doing an A-level at school. That is a subtler measure and takes into account&#151;as school funding does&#151;the fact that colleges have economies of scale and the factors that the noble Baroness mentioned about their having to provide for their own capital funding. It would be a better way of approaching this than to say that the unit of funding should be equivalent everywhere. That is not true anywhere else in the education system where the funding takes account of the circumstances of the provider. That is correct elsewhere and in this case.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09110251000114"></a>My amendment in this group addresses the logic of Clause 65. It seems to me that the way the subsections of that clause combine mean that a large FE college providing a substantial amount of free education to people under 18 but substantially the same education on commercial terms to people who want their workforce trained, would find, particularly given the wording of subsection (4) but also by the way all the subsections mesh together, that the YPLA was constrained to exercise its funding functions so as to secure that the work that the FE college was doing commercially had to be provided for free. I will go through the logic of that if the noble Lord wishes but I have had the opportunity to sit down with his officials and do that, and they understand what I am on about. Therefore, I am content not to spend the next five minutes trying inadequately to educate your Lordships about that.</p>

<a name="09110251000115"></a><b><a name="91102-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110251000425"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, this group of amendments responds mainly to concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, in particular, and by others around the Chamber in Committee. We on these Benches object to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency on a more fundamental level, as we have said before. We are concerned that by devolving responsibility for education of 16 to 19 year-olds to local authorities, headed by the YPLA, we are in danger of creating a confusing, bureaucratic and ultimately non-functional system of education. The lines of reporting, responsibility and funding appear to us to be tangled in such a way as to ensure that no one will be quite sure what they are or how they work. I very much fear that the nature of what my noble friend Lord Baker called a Byzantine structure will make it very difficult for the Government to put into practise the good intentions that I have no doubt they are trying to achieve. The Minister will doubtless assure us that this will not be the case. However, some concerns remain around the House.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09110251000116"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has tabled her Amendment 75 in a quest for clarity. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a response that will satisfy her. The amendments that the Government have tabled in response to concerns expressed about the YPLA do not answer our concerns about this structure and do not provide sufficient clarity to reassure us that this will function in a way that will implement the objectives effectively.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09110251000117"></a>Furthermore, the amendments do not address the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Eccles in Committee. How, for example, will the YPLA be expected to interact and work with the SFA, when they have such very differently constitutional bases? The SFA, as an agency, will be under the aegis of the Secretary of State. The YPLA, as an NDPB, will be supposedly independent. The Minister has not yet addressed these concerns sufficiently well and I hope that he will elaborate further. The bodies are very differently constituted, but we are constantly being told that they will find it easy to share information, to share back-office staff and functions and to provide an easy pathway for those under 19 who are involved in education to progress to adult education. I am looking to the Minister for further explanation.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09110251000118"></a>Specifically, in this instance, we express our opposition to government Amendments 71 and 72. These would allow the YPLA the power to appoint its own chief executive, albeit subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. If the YPLA is to exist, it should be held to account in the same way that the SFA as an agency should be held to account. The principle of democratic accountability must hold fast here. Noble Lords will be aware that we are of the opinion that this structure, as it is, will not work.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09110251000119"></a>In an ideal world, we would want to start from the very beginning to reformulate the Bill in an entirely different way. However, we recognise that we are nearing the end of its passage through your Lordships&#146; House and, instead, the power of revision, rather than fundamental restructuring, must be the path. Indeed, the Government have already started to dismantle the Learning and Skills Council and have created their shadow YPLA and SFA structures. We must, therefore, work with what we have in the Bill, as unsatisfactory

For this reason it is appropriate to oppose the power of the YPLA to separate itself from the Secretary of State by appointing its own chairman, even with the Secretary of State&#146;s approval.</p>

I only want to discuss Amendment 67, which addresses free college meals because, certainly, what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said about the treatment for the individual student being important and being clearly seen to be on an even keel wherever your education is taking place must be the right course to follow. I have to admit that it is not something that I had thought about before but, on free college meals, it is very pertinent that if you are to continue in education, exactly the same conditions should apply throughout the educational system. So I very much support those amendments.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09110255000001"></a>We understand the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the supportive role that the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will play in relation to local authorities is not sufficiently represented in the Bill. Taken together, Amendments 69, 71, 72, 77, 78, 79, 82 and 87, which I shall move, make explicit our vision for a collaborative and supportive YPLA.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09110255000002"></a>These amendments fulfil commitments that we made in Committee to enhance the YPLA board and to require it, in carrying out its commissioning functions, to have regard to what local authorities are doing. Importantly, Amendment 78 requires the YPLA to secure the Secretary of State&#146;s approval before exercising its direction-making powers under Clause 67.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09110255000003"></a>I hope that, given these assurances, the noble Baroness will agree that it is not necessary to specify in the Bill the operational detail set out in Amendment 75. This detail is best set out elsewhere, such as in the YPLA&#146;s remit letter. However, for the record, I am happy to confirm that the design and structure of the YPLA is geared to do what the amendment sets out: to operate the current national funding formula and to issue guidance that will be known as the national commissioning framework; to ensure that where cross-regional or national commissioning is required, it happens smoothly and in a non-bureaucratic way&#151;this will be particularly important for specialist provision, such as that for learners with learning difficulties or land-based colleges that offer courses such as animal husbandry and agricultural studies&#151;crucially, to ensure that local authorities and providers have access to and are using the very latest and accurate information as they develop their commissioning plans to meet the needs of young people; and to play a crucial role in convening the regional planning groups, providing data and analysis on educational and economic trends in a region or nationally.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09110255000004"></a>On Amendment 80, I am happy to assure the House that we have been working closely with the Association of Colleges and other partners to address  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their concerns on ensuring that the process of commissioning is speedy, transparent and fair. We have also listened to their views and those of other provider representatives as to how the expertise in schools, colleges and training providers can help to advise local authorities on what already is available to meet the needs of young people. We intend to include this in our imminent consultation on the national commissioning framework, as well as to amend the draft guidance already issued to help regional planning groups in their thinking. I shall place copies of both these documents in the House Library, when they are published.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09110255000005"></a>Our intention is that in the first instance any questions about local commissioning will be resolved through informal discussion between the decision-making body, usually the local authority, and the provider. If this does not resolve the issue, it will be escalated to a different level within the local authority&#151;higher than where the original decision was taken. This escalation and decision should take place within 14 days of receipt of the complaint. We expect the YPLA to be aware of this and, in the spirit of the amendment, want the YPLA to take a proactive stance in ensuring that the commissioning process is working effectively. If a school, college or other provider has any concerns, I would be surprised if they did not communicate those to both the local authority and the YPLA. Again, we shall set this out in the national commissioning framework.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09110255000006"></a>There may be a few instances when agreement is not reached by this local resolution process. In these circumstances, the complaint will be escalated, again with escalation and decision within 14 days, to a sub-committee of the regional planning group. We expect that the YPLA will convene and administer that sub-committee and, with the agreement of all parties, chair it. Where the YPLA is not chairing, we expect that the chair should be independent of the commissioning local authority&#151;perhaps another local authority with no vested interest in the outcome. The sub-committee would then make its recommendation to the commissioning local authority. Crucially, to ensure that the process is not held up, we would expect these complaints to be heard and dealt with as quickly as possible, but certainly within 14 days of the complaint being raised.</p>

<a name="91102-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09110255000007"></a>Regarding Amendment 74, the current funding is historical, dating back to pre-incorporation days when the rates for courses and colleges were set locally. We have moved a long way from that position to having a single funding formula, a national process for commissioning and greater stability in the FE sector. We have been tackling the funding gap as fast as resources allow. Since the academic year 2004-05, we have reduced the gap by eight percentage points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09110255000008"></a>I have received some further advice. The latest available figures show that we are on target to achieve a reduction of more than 8 per cent by 2008-09. The percentage difference has been measured by KPMG for each year since 2004, and the figures show a total change of minus 8.6 per cent. Perhaps we can pursue

I add in passing that over the past 10 years, we have increased funding for further education by around 52 per cent in real terms. That shows our commitment.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09110255000009"></a>I will address the deficiency in my previous statement that understandably concerned the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. We remain absolutely committed to reducing the funding gap further, with the clear caveat that this must happen as resources allow. However, we remain committed to reducing the funding gap, and not just sustaining it. We will also make two fresh commitments today. First, the YPLA will set out progress in reducing the funding gap in its annual report. Secondly, further research will be carried out and a report will be placed in the House Library once the 2011-12 year has been completed.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09110255000010"></a>I turn to Amendment 67 and the issue of free college meals. The cross-government review of financial support for 16 to 18 year-olds that we announced in the <I>New Opportunities </I>White Paper earlier this year provides us with an opportunity to consider, in the context of raising the participation age, how we can ensure that the support provided for post-16 learners is fair, and that their learning choices are not skewed by the support that is available to them. The review, which is due to report in spring next year, will take account of findings from research that we are undertaking into the barriers that young learners face to staying on in learning. One aspect that the research is looking at is whether the cost of lunch acts as a barrier to participation. We share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that this cost should not influence their decisions. We will shortly issue a public call for evidence to capture the views of stakeholders and young people in order to inform the review. As part of that, we will seek views on the current anomaly that exists in respect of free lunches.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09110255000011"></a>A further point of concern was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, concerning the proposed role for regional development agencies in setting skills strategies. I assure her of the central role that local authorities will have in the system. It may be helpful if I set out briefly how the new system will work. Regional development agencies will develop a skills strategy as part of the single regional strategy. This will be approved by a local authority leaders&#146; board, ensuring that local and regional skills needs are embedded in wider economic development strategies at regional level. They will also take account of the demands of local employers&#151;that is an area that concerns the noble Baroness&#151;of skills needs, and of the demand from young people in their area.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09110255000012"></a>The new system is designed around integration and partnership. It collects the needs of the region into one place to provide a single, simple statement of need for all relevant authorities to follow. All partners in the region, including local authorities, will need to be fully involved in the process, and it is in everyone&#146;s interests that full involvement takes place.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09110255000013"></a>I turn to Clause 65, which concerned the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I congratulate him on his forensic skills. We accept that subsection (4) is not as clear as we would wish. It is intended to prohibit colleges or other providers from charging 16 to 19 year-olds for

I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the point, and will be happy to bring forward an amendment to clarify this at Third Reading. I hope that, on the basis of these assurances, noble Lords will withdraw their amendments. I beg to move Amendment 67 in my name.</p>

The three issues that concerned me included two issues of equity, one of which was the disparity over school meals. I am glad that he has given an assurance that, within the framework of the review that is taking place, there will be specific consideration of the meals issue. I hope the Government will go beyond wondering whether the issue is a barrier to participation in colleges. It seems to me that, in so far as they are continuing to provide free school meals for young people in schools, it is logical for that same provision to be made within the college sector. If, however, they decide that, within the general framework of support for young people, free meals are no longer provided once they are 16 and that there are other means of supporting them, then that should apply across the board. It is important that there should be equivalence of support rather than that those young people who move on to colleges should face such a barrier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09110255000015"></a>In relation to the funding gap, I have some slightly different figures provided for me by the Association of Colleges, which also came from KPMG. KPMG seems to be doing a double act between the ministry and the Association of Colleges on this one, satisfying each of their clients with different sets of figures. Again, I am glad to get on the record a clear commitment from the Government that they are trying to reduce that funding gap, as far as resources allow, that the YPLA will set out in an annual report what progress has been made, and that a report will be placed in the Library of this House and, I take it, the other place. I am well satisfied with the Government&#146;s answer on those two issues of equity.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09110255000016"></a>In relation to Amendment 80 and the process of what colleges and schools do if they find the local authorities are not moving as fast as they would like them to, it still seems a rather complicated process. Nevertheless, it is one that provides for reconciliation and, as a 14-day limit has been put on the receipt of complaints, with a bit of luck, by the end of July when the colleges need to settle their budgets, some kind of agreement will have been reached. Therefore, I am happy to leave that.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09110255000017"></a>In relation to my Amendment 75, I am still sad that the Government are not prepared to put the functions in the Bill. I know how reluctant parliamentary counsel is to move in this direction and the assurance that they will be writ large in the remit letter is good to have. We shall see how far this goes. Again, I am pleased to have the assurance that, within the functioning of RDAs, local authorities will play some part. My worry is that the tone of the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, sent to Jim Braithwaite&#151;it was inclined to say that the RDA would develop the skills strategy and it would be binding on the SFA&#151;was a little

It is very important that these processes are not top-down but bottom-up, particularly because, as I mentioned in Committee, some of these regions are extraordinarily large. I come from the south-east region, which is huge. What is happening in one part of it does not apply in another. I instanced the fact that what is happening in Thanet is totally different from what is happening in Guildford, the part that I live in. We really need to work sub-regionally rather than regionally. It is very important at a local level&#151;and we talked a lot about this at an earlier point&#151;that employers, colleges, schools, local authorities and, if necessary, the sector skills councils can play their part in helping to formulate the skills strategies.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09110255000018"></a>Although I know the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, does not think much of the amendments put forward by the Government, which were largely based on amendments I put forward in Committee, I am very grateful to the Government for heeding them. They make the YPLA a slightly more independent body than it might otherwise be, which I do not think the opposition Benches are pleased about. If it is to exist, we on these Benches feel that it should have a degree of independence but that it should work in partnership with local authorities with a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. I thank the Government for what they have given us and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09110255000019"></a><b><a name="91102-0014.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09110255000085"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, noble Lords will recall that in Committee I gave an assurance to my noble friend Lord Layard that we would seek an alternative word to &#147;scheme&#148; to describe the duties set out in Clause 91. We have concluded that &#147;apprenticeship offer&#148; is a more appropriate term which does not have the negative connotations ascribed to &#147;scheme&#148;, referred to by my noble friend. I commend the change to the House. Government Amendment 99 would effect that change and most of the remaining amendments in the group provide for the renaming. The first amendment in the group replaces the word &#147;entitlement&#148;, which was an amendment incorrectly accepted in Committee, for the word &#147;offer&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09110255000020"></a>On government amendments 106 and 120, your Lordships will recall that I also gave a commitment in Committee to bring forward proposals that would make the apprenticeship scheme more accessible to people with learning difficulties. We have been working with the Special Educational Consortium, SKILL, RNIB, Mencap and other key interest groups to ensure that we have proposals which address the concerns raised by them and by noble Lords across the House. On the basis of these discussions, we have decided to adopt the proposal by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, to allow people with a learning difficulty or disability to submit a portfolio of evidence which demonstrates their preparedness to undertake an apprenticeship, as an alternative to the requirements in Clause 95(1) and (2). Amendment 120 would enable us to set regulations that deliver this option to young people without in any way lowering the bar in terms of the competencies required to undertake an apprenticeship.</p>

<a name="91102-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09110255000021"></a>Government Amendment 106 also gives us the flexibility through regulations to extend the apprenticeship scheme by describing groups of persons who may elect for the scheme over the age of 19 and up to the age of 25. This is intended to allow young people with disabilities, who may take longer to reach the point at which they are ready to undertake an apprenticeship, to benefit from the scheme. We are absolutely committed to working with the Special Educational Consortium, SKILL, RNIB, Mencap and other partners, to develop sets of regulations and to ensure that we get the regulations right in terms of the criteria and accessibility.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09110255000022"></a>I also reiterate my commitment to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that we will indeed ensure that, in developing these regulations, we will act in accordance with the public sector disability equality duty under Section 49A of the Disability Discrimination Act, and also the Education and Skills Act 2008, which requires us to take account of the needs of those with learning difficulties and disabilities. Let me be absolutely clear about our commitment to ensuring access to apprenticeships and other training opportunities for people with learning difficulties. My honourable friend the Minister for Apprenticeships will be taking a close interest in the development of these regulations, and he will expect to have a progress report before the end of March.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09110255000023"></a>I share the commitment of my noble friends Lord Layard, Lady Blackstone and Lady Morris in Amendment 110, to progression for all young people, in particular from an apprenticeship at level 2 to one at level 3. I respect and understand their perseverance,  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_99"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but, as I have said, it must be right for us to focus first on securing a first apprenticeship for the many young people who have not had this opportunity. I repeat the assurance that I gave the noble Lord in Committee, that we will ensure that the apprenticeship agreement has a prescribed term that requires employers to have discussions with their apprentices, and encourages progression beyond an apprenticeship at level 2. I stress the importance of encouraging employers to understand the value and the benefit they get in encouraging apprentices to go beyond level 2. Clearly, where young people make the choice to progress to an advanced apprenticeship, we will provide funding to enable them to complete it.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09110255000024"></a>Amendment 129 was another issue that we considered in Committee. I understand the motive behind this amendment, which is to incentivise more employers to take on young people as apprentices, an objective which everyone in this House shares. I am happy to reassure him that there are already administrative arrangements in place to enable employers to access funding for apprenticeship training directly from the National Apprenticeships Service. I have asked the National Apprenticeships Service to ensure that it promotes this option proactively to employers, and I will take a personal, active interest in ensuring that they really will undertake a programme to promote this option, and not leave it to employers merely to request the funding. My noble friend understands the question of ensuring that if we give direct funding, we have to ensure that there is a proper process of accreditation and that the courses provided are of the appropriate standard. I hope, on the basis of these assurances, that my noble friends will feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09110255000025"></a>Finally, on government Amendments 121 and 122, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, quite rightly raised a question about why it was that the levels of qualification in Clause 96 were based on the opinion of the Secretary of State, and had no input from the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09110255000026"></a>The clause reflects the drafting in the Education and Skills Act 2008, and was drafted prior to the drafting of the clauses that establish Ofqual. Once again, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his forensic skills in bringing that to our attention, and I trust that he, and the whole House, will agree that the amendments, which ensure that the Secretary of State must consult Ofqual, address that omission. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09110255000028"></a>I am not entirely happy with what the Minister said about Amendment 110. It seems to me that this is a basic question about what we are offering our young people. If they are going down the full-time route, they are guaranteed progression; if they are going down the part-time route, they are not. It is as simple as that. If we were saying, &#147;Can we do it?&#148;, obviously, the answer is that we could not do it tomorrow, but we are not saying that, we are saying that when the entitlement is introduced, it should include a guarantee of progression.  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If someone has already gone through an apprentice level 2, they will not be entitled to that option, if the amendment were passed, until 2015. We are talking about something six years hence and about building the basic skill formation system in this country for the following 20 years. It is not good enough to say that that is too difficult; we do many difficult things. On whose behalf should we do the most difficult things? On behalf of the more deprived members of the community, who are getting an extremely poor deal at the moment.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09110255000029"></a>We cannot be happy about what the Minister has said, and I think that we will have to come back to it, because it involves the central content of the Bill. We have a huge apparatus to set up an apprenticeship scheme, but the scheme has a major weakness at its heart, which we will have to revisit.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09110255000030"></a>I move to Amendment 129. I was very encouraged by what the Minister said, in particular about his personal commitment to ensure that the selling of apprenticeships to employers&#151;making known the possibility for them to receive direct funding&#151;is actively pursued. However, I think something more is needed: a set of regulations that make that route more attractive to employers. We must make apprenticeships much more attractive to employers if we are to implement the entitlements that we have been talking about. In the next six years, we must double the number of apprenticeships for young people under 19. That is a massive challenge, and it cannot be done unless we make apprenticeships more attractive to employers&#151;especially those who do not currently take on apprentices.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09110255000031"></a>It is often not realised that most large employers do not employ any apprentices. Of employers employing more than 500 people, only 25 per cent have any apprentices. There is something very wrong in the way that we are structuring the incentives for employers. We will not engage enough further employers unless we can find new ways to motivate them. It will be just more of the same, which will not get us to where we need to be. The obvious method is to make it easier for them to get direct access to apprentice funding. At the moment, it is possible in theory, but in practice it happens extremely rarely, expect in the case of big national employers. There is simple evidence that the system is not structured to attract employers to do the things they need to do if we are to get the places we want. It seems to me that the existing system is doing a good job through the training companies&#151;there is no question of wanting to displace that role, but we have got to open up a new route. The Government really need to produce new regulations which overcome some of the barriers that employers currently experience in thinking about accessing the funding directly. There needs to be a Government commitment to producing a new set of regulations that make the direct funding route more attractive to employers. Will the Minister, given his enthusiasm for this subject, commit to actually producing a scheme of regulations rather than just a promotional effort? I do not think that anything less will do.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment 110, it is really illogical that the Government are not encouraging the expected progression. The noble Lord, Lord Layard, has pointed out that he does not want the provision to come into effect immediately. He proposes that by 2015, the raising of the participation age will mean that young people will have to be either in education, at college or at school, or in training or in an apprenticeship. The Government are anxious to encourage young people to progress&#151;there is a logical progression open to young people, for example, who stay on and do their A-levels. We make it easy for them to go on to university but this is not the case in the progression from a level 2 apprenticeship to a level 3 apprenticeship. I find this quite extraordinary and we support that amendment.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09110255000033"></a>Turning to Amendment 129, the Minister may know that there has been a recent CFBT publication called <I>Lessons from history</I><I>:</I><b></b><I>Increasing the number of 16 and 17 year</I><I> olds in education and training. </I>This points out that a scheme of subsidies to employers to take on young apprentices during the recession of 1979 to 1983 actually helped to increase the number of 16 to 18 year-olds going into employer-based apprenticeships by 57,000. These are very substantial figures. There are lessons to be learnt from history. In Committee, the Minister talked about the &#147;dead weight&#148; of perhaps providing a subsidy for young people. He should bear in mind that we are talking about those under 19, not those over 19 for whom this wage subsidy should be provided. One could argue that it should be for small firms rather than large firms. The noble Lord, Lord Layard, pointed out that many large firms do not pull their weight in taking on the number of apprentices that they might. If you look at Train to Gain you can argue that the wage compensation for small firms provides some form of subsidy for those who are over 19. If you are providing a subsidy through Train to Gain for those over 19, why not provide it for those under 19 as well?</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09110256000001"></a>The Government say that they will increase the learning participation age to 18 by 2015. In trying to encourage more 16 to 18-year-olds to go into apprenticeships&#151;they will have all the stocks by that stage&#151;they are offering any young person who wishes to go into an apprenticeship the entitlement to do so; yet no apprenticeships are available at present. How will they ensure that the number of apprenticeships is available? Such a scheme would undoubtedly help to increase the number on offer. They need, in any case, to expand the 16 and 17 year-old employer-based apprenticeships by turning jobs without training into apprenticeships. It is part of their whole strategy that those who leave at 16 and go into jobs without training should become apprentices.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09110256000002"></a>Finally, part of the Government&#146;s strategy is to reduce the number of those who end up not in employment, education or training&#151;the NEET category&#151;which currently stands at 9 per cent and is rising. However, I point out to the Minister that over the past year the number of 16 and 17 year-olds going into apprenticeships has not increased but has gone down. On Amendment 99, a very disappointing number of young people have progressed from a level 2  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_102"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apprenticeship to a level 3 apprenticeship. Both the amendments have a great deal of logic to them, and we on these Benches support the noble Lord&#146;s argument.</p>

<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="09110256000003"></a><b><a name="91102-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110256000081"></a>Baroness Blackstone:</b> My Lords, I, too, support my noble friend Lord Layard. Indeed, I put my name to these two amendments. I will not repeat everything that has already been said, although I very much agree with much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has just said.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09110256000004"></a>On Amendment 110, the Minister said that employers would be required to discuss with young people who had completed a level 2 apprenticeship the possibility of moving on to a level 3 apprenticeship. I very much support that proposal, but I do not think that it goes far enough. As my noble friend Lord Layard said, we do not have the opportunity very often to change the law on a subject such as this. When we have such an opportunity, we should grasp it, as we would for young people who are in full-time education.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09110256000005"></a>I am particularly concerned about the lack of equity between those who will go down the part-time, work-based learning route and those who will go down the full-time, GCSE to A-levels, A-levels to higher education route. It is grotesquely unfair to give that latter group of young people an entitlement but not to allow it for this group of young people, particularly as many of them will come from much less privileged backgrounds where they do not have the kind of support that the other category of young people can expect from their families and from other people in their neighbourhoods and communities. We will lose an enormously important opportunity if we do not have an entitlement in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09110256000006"></a>As my noble friend said, if we were going to implement this legislation tomorrow, or even next year or the year after, I would understand the reluctance of my colleagues in the Government to accept this amendment, but we have six years to plan for it. I believe passionately that we should accept it and in doing so make a future for many young people which they currently do not have. Our economy needs it, so it is a matter not just of social justice but of having more highly trained young people. Whatever benefits we will get from larger numbers of 16 to 19 year-olds doing a level 2 apprenticeship we will be able to multiply many times over if we assume that those who do this successfully can go on to the next stage. I am sure that no one in this House would believe that a level 2 apprenticeship will be enough to take us to the next stage of a highly trained, highly skilled workforce for the sort of economy we will see as the 21st century develops. I very much hope that the Minister will take this back and think again about it. We have an enormous budget in Train to Gain and there might be an opportunity to shift some of those resources into something for those 19 to 25 year-olds or 19 to 22 year-olds&#151;whatever cut-off date we make&#151;who want to take their education and training to the next stage.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09110256000007"></a>Behind my commitment to Amendment 125 lies a genuine concern that we will not get enough apprenticeship places. We are starting from a very low base. There has to be a strong and powerful incentive to employers to get engaged with the provision of apprenticeships. I have talked to quite a number of employers in the public and private sectors, and they are worried about  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what this means for them in terms of resources. We will have to hold out a rather bigger and more obviously accessible carrot than we are at the moment.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09110256000008"></a>I accept that the details of this may need a little more work, but it seems a reasonable requirement that the head of the National Apprenticeship Service should put forward a totally comprehensible scheme which is not too bureaucratic and is easily accessible for employers who wish to engage in apprenticeships. They are a little nervous and concerned about what it will mean for their firms and organisations, in the public as well as the private sector, if they go down this route. They are concerned that there may be very little to compensate them for the extra time that it takes to look after these young employees and give them the training that they deserve.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09110256000009"></a>I, too, join others in thanking the Government for changing the nomenclature. Terminology is important and the word &#147;offer&#148; is a much better term than scheme. I very much welcome what the Minister has said about improving access to apprenticeships for disabled young people. They have a huge amount to give and we should do everything we can to make it easier for them to get the training that they want and deserve. I give my grateful thanks to the Government for moving in that respect.</p>

In particular, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about the need for caution regarding whether the resources are available to provide these apprenticeships. Secondly, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, in her use of the word honesty. It is extremely important that we are honest with our young people and that we do not offer them something that cannot be delivered. I do not know whether Members of the House are aware that Nissan, the Japanese car firm in Sunderland, is offering more apprenticeships than the whole of the public sector in the north-east. That suggests that it is hugely important to have a close dialogue with employers to ensure that the apprenticeships offered in particular parts of the country are related to the employment available so that there is a follow-on to whatever people have learnt. It suggests that dialogue in different parts of the country is different, but that it is based on resources and honesty, as mentioned by the two noble Baronesses.</p>

Without it, the Bill would have been a hugely retrograde step. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Young, for tabling the amendment, for the meeting that he held, and for the way in which he told us about it. This may be asking for the cherry on the top of the cake as well, but I hope he can confirm, given the traditions and practices that have grown up around allowing in those with special educational needs, that the whole idea of the work-in-progress attitude will be taken forward. The noble Lord covered most of this, particularly the legal grounds which he described very well, but is it the Government&#146;s intention that the spirit which has been developed is to be carried forward? It will mean that people are not excluded

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09110256000012"></a>Again, I thank the Minister for bringing forward government Amendment 120. It removes one of my great worries about the Bill. I might have been slightly OTT in suggesting on the last occasion that we torture the person who drafted the Bill as it was, but it was worth it for the look on the face of the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, as I said it. We should make sure that we capture the spirit of previous legislation over many years. I thank the Government for the, shall we say, well-timed and gracious way that they have taken these corrective steps.</p>

This is quite a disparate group of amendments, but I welcome in particular government Amendments 106 and 120&#151;amendments which deal with issues which a range of organisations representing disabled people have been concerned with and in discussion with the Government about, as the noble Lord mentioned. I have a connection with a good many of those organisations, as president of Skill and now vice-president of the RNIB, so I declare those interests.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09110256000014"></a>Amendment 106 provides a power to extend apprenticeship offers to prescribed groups up to the age of 25, while Amendment 120 provides a power to make regulations setting alternative qualifying criteria for young people with learning difficulties who wish to apply to do an apprenticeship. The idea is to introduce a flexible system whereby those who might not be able to fulfil the minimum requirements on account of their disability will be able to submit an alternative portfolio of evidence that they are in fact ready and able to undertake an apprenticeship. Indeed, the Alliance for Inclusive Education has asked that a similarly flexible approach should be adopted in relation to those apprenticeship schemes&#151;I suppose that they will be called &#147;offers&#148; in the future&#151;that stipulate criteria higher than the minimum. I believe that the Government should monitor such schemes or offers carefully to make sure that stricter criteria are specified only in cases where it is appropriate to do so and are not specified unless there is a clear justification for it.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09110256000015"></a>These amendments are something for which organisations representing disabled people have been asking and they are very much to be welcomed. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, if he had been here, would have wanted to echo what I have said in extending a warm welcome to them. Indeed, he is very sorry that he is not able to be present at this stage and has asked me to associate him with my remarks.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09110256000016"></a>I want to make a few more comments with which I think he would also be glad to be associated. The reason that organisations representing disabled people welcome these amendments so warmly is that they are concerned that the extension of the apprenticeship entitlement to 25 should not be confined just to those with a learning disability assessment but should also encompass the broader group of those with any learning difficulty significantly greater than their peers&#146; but who may not

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09110256000017"></a>The Government have made it clear that they could not commit to such an extension in terms at this stage, but these amendments create the space for future regulations and guidance to be framed using the wider definition of &#147;learning difficulty&#148; to which I have just referred. Ministers are taking powers to permit the use of alternative evidence of ability and to extend the entitlement to 25 for the broader category of people with a learning difficulty, but taking these powers makes a difference only to the extent that Ministers take steps to use them.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09110256000018"></a>In that regard, I want to ask the Minister for certain commitments. First, we need him to commit to a specific timescale. Full implementation of the Bill has a fairly extended timescale, with statutory guidance due only in a year&#146;s time. We could easily lose momentum if we do not get moving earlier than that.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09110256000019"></a>Next, I would like to hear a commitment to work with key stakeholders without delay on developing the regulations and guidance&#151;I think we have already heard that from the Minister in introducing the amendments&#151;and on immediate practical steps that can be taken by the National Apprenticeship Service and partners to encourage increased participation of disabled young people.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09110256000020"></a>The reason that that is so important is that the latest data made available by the National Apprenticeship Service highlight the fact that the apprenticeship participation of learners with learning difficulties and learning disabilities aged 19 to 25 is currently lower than that of the cohorts both younger and older than this cohort. That should make it a matter of urgency to work on this following the Bill&#146;s enactment, as many disabled young people between the ages of 19 and 25 are ready to enter apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09110256000021"></a>I believe that the National Apprenticeship Service would be open to this, but it will need the support of other agencies, such as the YPLA, and a clear lead from Ministers and the SFA. In turn, providers will need to have adjusted minimum levels of performance, as these can be a real disincentive to recruiting disabled apprentices at present. In other words, there needs to be a clear message from the top that recruitment of disabled apprentices should be a priority, which, I fear, we have not heard to date. As things stand, disabled young people get quite a good deal from the LSC. It would be of major reassurance to the field if the Minister made a commitment that they will receive no less priority under the new regime being enacted under this legislation.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09110256000022"></a>Lastly, I ask the Minister to commit to providing a Written Ministerial Statement on progress made in three or four months&#146; time&#151;in other words, before we have an election.</p>

<a name="91102-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09110256000023"></a>In summary, I am asking the Minister for four commitments: a timescale for exercising the powers that are being taken under this legislation; to work with stakeholders on regulations, guidance and practical steps to encourage participation of those aged 19 to 25;

I particularly welcome Amendment 120, to which the noble Lord, Lord Young, referred me when I was speaking on an earlier amendment; the need for those who have a learning difficulty to be treated in a way that allows time to complete their course up to the age of 25 is important.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09110256000025"></a>I am very enthusiastic about the other two amendments as well. Amendment 110, as has been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, is a requirement laid down; however, it need not come into effect until the entitlement comes into effect. On the provision for funding for employers, it is clear that we need to encourage more employers to enter the scheme and not feel that they are being disadvantaged by engaging in this way. I hope very much that we will hear that all three amendments, as well as the others which I will not mention, will be fully supported.</p>

We remain dissatisfied with much of the Bill, as those who have been present throughout will be aware, but we are grateful for the efforts of the Minister and his Bill team for bringing forward a great many changes in response to concerns.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09110256000027"></a>I want to address the subject of extending the apprenticeship entitlement to prescribed groups where the upper age limit is 25. I understand that the Minister and his Bill team put a great deal of work into discussions with SKILL and other SEN groups so that those with learning difficulties and disabilities are not totally excluded from the apprenticeship entitlement. Amendment 106 allows the provision to be extended and Amendment 120 allows regulations to be made, which will make provision regarding circumstances where alternative criteria might be accepted in respect of specific groups who appear to the chief executive of the SFA to have a learning difficulty under the definition in the Education Act 1996.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09110256000028"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s intentions in this regard. Perhaps, however, the Minister might be able to satisfy me on the following points. First, can he inform your Lordships what extra costs he expects these provisions to entail? Extending the apprenticeship entitlement in this way must mean that calculations have been done, and estimates made of the increased cost. I would be grateful to hear from him on this count. Secondly, could he perhaps go into some detail about what he expects alternative provisions might be? Like other noble Lords, we welcome the potential expansion of criteria by regulations which would widen access to those with learning difficulties or disabilities which could mean that they could not achieve five GCSEs, including maths and English. Nevertheless, widening access should not mean lowering standards.

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09110256000029"></a>I now turn my attention briefly to Amendment 129, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Layard. Noble Lords will be aware that we agree with the principle of this amendment. Indeed, we moved a similar amendment in Committee in another place, which proposed that all employers who took on an apprentice within a recognised apprenticeships framework should be paid directly by the chief executive of skills funding. The reasons behind this are easy to understand. We believe that it is simpler to channel funding into a single stream which then goes directly to employers. In contrast, the Government have chosen to introduce another body&#151;the National Apprenticeship Service&#151;through which funding will be directed. This service may indeed have a useful role to play in securing an effective apprenticeship scheme, but throughout the Committee stage, we emphasised the importance of a direct connection between government and employers when looking at apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09110256000030"></a>We have also constantly said that we want a reduction in the convoluted and spaghetti-like structure of the various bodies, agencies, quangos and organisations that are required to interact and somehow produce the Government&#146;s desired results. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, has the advantage of achieving these objectives in a simple and direct fashion. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Layard, I hope that we might see more. In particular, when we get to the point when the economy is improving and the prospect of a job seems more likely to young people, we should encourage them to embark on qualifications rather later. First, that is good for them as it means that they are doing qualifications when they are ready and wanting to do them. Secondly, that improves the Government&#146;s cash flow, because our subsidy to them, rather than coming at age 17, 18 or 19, comes five or six years later. It is better for both groups if we can do that. I agree that we cannot do it now, because the young will not believe that there is a job to go to if they do not go through a qualification. As things improve, however, we can make use of flexibility to move in a direction that will be good for the Government and for young people.</p>

I welcome the bits that have been welcomed, although even those have had a few caveats. I thought how lucky I was that the noble Lord, Lord Low, felt that we had met some of his wishes. He has only given me four tasks as a result, and I am glad that he is coming back to his place because the answer to all his questions is, in summary, yes. That is the most succinct answer; given where we are at this point, I have a funny feeling that I will not get any thanks if I detain your Lordships longer than I need to.

I also reassure the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that we will meet the spirit as well as the legal intent, so to speak. I shall now try to address the points of concern that my noble friend Lord Layard raised earlier. I want to set in context what we have done on apprenticeships. Without wearying your Lordships with a set of statistics that I have given on many occasions, we are in danger of forgetting that we have come a long way on the apprenticeship journey. From 1997, when, as I have said before, the scheme was practically dead on its feet with just over 60,000 participants, we now have over a quarter of a million, with two-thirds of them completing their apprenticeships. We should remember that context, as that is where we have come from and it has been a huge journey.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09110256000035"></a>We know that we have a big task to meet the targets that we have set ourselves. How are we to meet those targets? We should not underestimate the role and importance of the National Apprenticeship Service, which is the one-stop shop that will drive the situation with employers. Attitudes are beginning to change, but we have a long way to go yet and it is not just about loading more money on to employers. We are already paying for all the training of apprentices up to 19, which is not a bad bargain.</p>

<a name="91102-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09110256000036"></a>On the idea that apprentices should somehow be seen as a burden, that is not a good way of trying to sell the apprenticeship scheme to employers. They are not a burden but a real incentive, often by creating the next layer of management and leadership and in bringing increased vitality and ideas within a company, so I want to put the role of apprenticeships in that context. We are also moving from the situation where we were apprenticeship-light in the public sector. It should be remembered that we put another &#163;140 million into apprenticeships this year, and are trying to ensure that we create another 21,000 apprenticeship places in the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09110256000037"></a>We are committed to allocating funding directly to employers where they meet the required standard. I cannot absolutely guarantee a new set of regulations but I shall certainly take away the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, and discuss with the National Apprenticeship Service exactly what we are doing in these circumstances; for instance, how funding is allocated to group training associations which are used by many thousands of employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09110256000038"></a>I do not have the precise figures with regard to levels 2 and 3, but some of the figures that I do have are interesting. For example, the proportion of all apprenticeships that are advanced has increased, as has the total number of advanced apprenticeships, and 73,000 people started an advanced apprenticeship in 2007-08, up 40 per cent on the previous year. The proportion of advanced apprenticeships has remained around 30 per cent in recent years, increasing to 32 per cent in 2007-08. Clearly, there is no room for complacency in this area&#151;I would be the last person to suggest that&#151;but there has been progress. There is a requirement on employers to discuss with their apprentices a request to progress from level 2 to level 3. In many industries, for example the engineering industry, there is almost a

We make it absolutely clear that where there is an agreement we will fund those apprenticeships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09110256000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked me about the cost implications of extending the entitlement. The best estimate is &#163;2.8 million in 2014, rising to &#163;16.7 million in 2020, subject to the level of take-up. Those are the best figures I can give at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said that we needed to be honest with young people; I absolutely agree with him. First, we have to create apprenticeships; we must not take our eye off that ball. I make no apology for repeating that every apprenticeship we create for a young person is a beacon of hope. The first thing we need to do is to get them on that first rung. Of course, we do not necessarily want them to stay there but when you talk to young people you discover that their first concern is to get an apprenticeship. We do not want to put any barriers in the way of young people progressing. That is to their advantage and that of employers. We must not underestimate the importance of changing employers&#146; attitude so that they do not see apprenticeships as a burden. I repeat that they are not a burden; they are a real advantage to companies. However, we have a long way to go to convince them all of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09110256000040"></a>I do not know whether I can be positive as regards what noble Lords said in relation to the six-year period. I shall reflect on the implications of that. I do not want to raise false hopes in that regard other than to say that we shall consider that timescale. I hope that I shall be forgiven if I have not covered every point in the interests of time, given the lateness of the hour. I hope that in the light of the assurances I have given the relevant amendments will be withdrawn. I thank noble Lords who participated in the debate for their informative and constructive comments.</p>

These regulations follow from the Saving Gateway Accounts Act, which received Royal Assent in July. Alongside that Act and the Saving Gateway Accounts (No. 2) Regulations, which cover tax relief and so are being debated only in the other place, these regulations will set out the legislative framework for a national saving gateway scheme.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000004"></a>As noble Lords will know, the saving gateway will give around 8 million working people on lower incomes the chance to earn 50p from the Government for each pound that they save. It aims to kick-start a savings habit and to bring people into contact with mainstream financial services, some of them for the first time. I am pleased to say that those aims have had widespread support from all sides of this House, in the other place and beyond. I hope that noble Lords will also support these regulations, which will make the saving gateway a reality.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000005"></a>The regulations cover three main areas, which I will briefly outline. First, they provide further details on eligibility for the saving gateway. The saving gateway account sets out that eligibility will be passported from entitlement to certain benefits and tax credits. This is the simplest and most efficient method available for determining saving gateway eligibility. These passporting benefits and tax credits include both working tax credit and child tax credit. However, as these tax credits can be received at a range of different incomes, we have been clear that only claimants with incomes below a certain level should be eligible for the saving gateway. These regulations will align that level with the income threshold for child tax credit, which is  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>currently &#163;16,040. Also in relation to eligibility, the regulations set out the connection with the UK that people would need to have in order to be eligible for the saving gateway. This is that the person must be ordinarily resident in the UK, which broadly means that they must either live or work here.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000006"></a>The second major area that the regulations cover is the features of saving gateway accounts. Many of these will be familiar to noble Lords and are now as they were announced in December last year. They were contained in the draft regulations published in February and were discussed during the passage of the Bill earlier this year. Let me pick out the most significant of these features. Regulation 7 sets the maturity period&#151;how long each saving gateway account will last&#151;at 24 months. Regulation 11 sets out the monthly deposit limit for saving gateway accounts at &#163;25. Regulation 9 sets the amount that the Government will contribute to each pound saved&#151;the match rate, as it is sometimes called&#151;at 50p. As noble Lords may know, we experimented with different match rates during the second pilot of the saving gateway and we believe that a rate of 50p for each pound provides better value for money than a higher match rate, while still providing a strong incentive to save. Together, these features of the saving gateway mean that account holders will be able to save up to &#163;600 in their accounts and earn up to &#163;300 from the Government.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000007"></a>Thirdly, the regulations set out the detailed requirements that will be placed on account providers. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke on a number of occasions during the passage of the Bill about the importance of there being a range of providers. I have been working hard to ensure that this is the case and I am confident that there will be sufficient providers to support a national saving gateway scheme and to provide eligible people with a choice of where to open accounts. I am encouraging major retail banks and potential providers to recognise the importance of being involved with the saving gateway, which will benefit the wider community, particularly at this current time.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000008"></a>As I said, the regulations set out the requirements that will be placed on saving gateway accounts. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, stressed during the passage of the Bill the importance of these requirements being kept to a minimum and being as simple as possible. That is very much the approach that we have followed. We have, in fact, made a number of changes to our original proposals for the saving gateway in order to achieve that. For example, the regulations do not include any requirement for providers to pay interest to account holders and they require providers to issue statements only six-monthly, rather than quarterly as originally proposed.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000009"></a>During the passage of the Bill through this House, we also decided that account providers would not be required to offer account holders the opportunity to transfer their accounts between providers other than in a limited range of circumstances. That was a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and it is the position taken in these regulations. The regulations also set out the detail of the returns that providers will make to HMRC. We have been careful to minimise the amount of information that will be required.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000010"></a>In conclusion, these regulations will form a vital part of the legislative framework for the national saving gateway scheme to be introduced next year; we will announce an exact start date for the saving gateway in due course. They reflect the lessons learnt from the two pilots of the saving gateway, the responses to the detailed consultation that we carried out in 2008 and the comments that we have received since they were first published in draft in February. We are very grateful for the input from many different groups, including many noble Lords during the passage of the Bill earlier this year. For example, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, argued in Grand Committee that the regulations should prevent account holders from selling their accounts or borrowing against them; Regulation 10(1)(g) now provides that the account must be in the &#147;beneficial ownership&#148; of the account holder.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000011"></a>I believe that the engagement and consultation that we have had over a number of years have contributed to the design of a scheme that will offer a real incentive to save, in the financial mainstream, to working-age people on lower incomes&#151;a group with lower savings and higher levels of financial exclusion than the remainder of the population. This is a targeted initiative that could make a real difference to the lives of around 8 million people in this country and I am pleased that it has had such widespread support in this House. I hope that that will continue today.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000012"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110213000081"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations and I congratulate the Treasury on heeding the report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in July and on tabling revised regulations to take account of that report. The Minister will be aware that I tabled a Motion in July to ensure that the report of the Joint Committee was taken into account and I am glad that the Treasury has done so with these revised regulations.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000013"></a>As the Minister said, we debated the content of the regulations in draft form fairly extensively throughout our deliberations on the Bill, so there is little that we find unexpected in the regulations that we have before us, which should cut down the time that we take today.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000014"></a>I have just one prior point for the Minister. In talking about the saving gateway scheme, he said that an account holder would get 50p from the Government. In fact, the 50p savings incentive will come from the taxpayer. We must never forget that the scheme has to provide value for money to the taxpayer; it must represent a good use of money in the effect that it has on savings in the target community. We look forward to the report that will be made on the saving gateway scheme, which the Government produced an amendment for in the final stages of the Bill. However, that is some way off, so I just confine my remarks to reminding the Minister that it is taxpayers&#146; money, not the Government&#146;s.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000015"></a>There are two areas where I want to question the Minister, the first of which relates to timing. I want to press him to say when the Act will be commenced and, following on from that, when the scheme will be commenced. I think that he said something like &#147;in due course&#148;, which is one of those phrases that are designed to convey no information whatever. Therefore, I ask the Minister to be a little more precise if he  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possibly can be about when the Government expect to start the scheme and have it up and running and capable of receiving money by way of the relevant savings accounts.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000016"></a>The other area on which I want to press the Minister is account providers. I had hoped that he would give details of the account providers who would be likely to come forward. He will recall that during our deliberations on the Bill we had many discussions about the economics of saving gateway accounts and whether account providers would want to come forward. We knew that many wanted to take part, including the Post Office, but that the economics were a potential difficulty.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000017"></a>The Minister has said some warm words about good discussions and about banks potentially coming forward, but I heard no specifics whatever during the passage of the Bill. Several months have elapsed since then and I had hoped that we could get a better idea of whether there would indeed be a diversity of saving gateway account providers. As the Minister will be aware, the aim behind the Bill has all-party support and, therefore, we want to see this experiment take place and be judged properly. A proper experiment cannot take place unless there is proper diversity of account providers, so I hope that the Minister can go a little further than the rather careful words that he used in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000018"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110213000082"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his introduction to this short debate. As he said, the draft instrument contains no surprises. In one respect, I am sorry that it does not, because one point that I made, no doubt at laborious length, as the Bill was going through was that, uniquely among all the areas where the Government are encouraging people to save through the tax system, in this case there is a very tight time limit of 24 months. That principle does not apply to pensions or child trust funds and it is a pity that it applies here. I think that the argument that if people have saved for up to 24 months they will carry on saving when the benefit is withdrawn is seriously flawed. However, I realise that this is not an issue on which we can make much progress today.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000019"></a>The only substantive point that I want to make beyond that is to pick up on what the noble Baroness said about providers. The Minister said that he was confident that there would be sufficient providers, including a number of the major retail banks. Like the noble Baroness, I should be grateful if he could say a bit more about that. When the Bill was going through, the only organisation that expressed any public willingness to participate in the scheme was the Post Office, and then only with very heavy qualifications in terms of the economics. Given everything else that is going on at the moment, it is unlikely that Mr Crozier is spending much time worrying about whether he can introduce saving gateway accounts.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000020"></a>At some point in our debate on credit unions last week, or possibly the previous week, there was a throwaway reference&#151;and I apologise for not having it to hand&#151;about credit unions possibly being able to offer this product. I found that rather surprising, because credit unions are very small and I should have thought that the bureaucracy involved for them in setting up the scheme might be too much of a burden.

<p><a name="09110213000022"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110213000083"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for their contributions to the discussion. I am pleased to note that, as I anticipated, we have continued to see broad support for the concept of the saving gateway, as evidenced during the passage of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, is right to point to the timeliness of the proposal in the context of current economic circumstances.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000023"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness about the Joint Committee once again showing its effectiveness and directing us towards improvements, which we have welcomed. I also note the noble Baroness&#146;s comments about the taxpayer as opposed to the Government. I have to say that I regularly struggle, when talking about our investments in the shares of a number of banks, in deciding whether I should say that these are in public ownership, owned by the taxpayer or owned by the Government, but I think that we all understand the noble Baroness&#146;s point, which is that the state has no money of its own; it acts in that respect on behalf of the taxpayers and must be accountable for the Government&#146;s decisions. I believe that that accountability has been evident in the thorough research that has taken place in support of this proposal.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000024"></a>On timing, we have announced that the scheme will be available nationwide from 2010. The precise starting date depends on a number of factors, including in particular the progress of our discussions with potential providers about when they would be ready to offer accounts. They need to make significant systems investment and we do not want the accounts to be launched until such time as there are sufficient account providers to ensure that we have national coverage and accessibility for the eligible community and that the account providers are able to operate the scheme effectively. It is with that in mind that I continue to have regular engagement with a number of banking institutions in connection with the provision of saving gateway accounts; indeed, I have been in such discussions in the past week or so. As has been noted in debate, the Post Office has indicated a wish to provide a saving gateway account, which would be entirely compatible with its ambition to improve the range and quality of its banking offer. My words on timing were, therefore, carefully chosen and are importantly predicated on reaching a point when we can be assured that the scheme will launch effectively without any administrative problems.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000025"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was also right to remind us that, for a bank, the question whether to offer such accounts is one in which the economics need to be carefully evaluated. However, we have always been very clear that we would not expect the decision to be made solely on the basis of economics. At a time when the banking industry has to face serious challenges around reputation and utility, there is clearly an opportunity for retail banks to evidence their commitment to provide something that has a  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>social good to it and, importantly, reaches out to the large group of people who are not part of the financial system and could be welcomed into it through the saving gateway. However, I repeat that we shall not launch the saving gateway account until we believe that adequate provision will be accessible to the community at which it is targeted.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked why the gateway should be time-limited to 24 months. It certainly needs to be time-limited, although whether 24 months is the right period is debatable. Research suggests that the combination of the amount of monthly deposit, the matching benefit and the time should be sufficient to establish the saving habit. This is a proposal to kick-start saving and initiate people into the formal financial sector, giving them the habit of saving. One hopes that, with the encouragement that the taxpayer&#146;s support provides, people will then continue to save, through ISAs or some other mechanism. We have committed to review the effectiveness of the saving gateway account. One of the most critical questions that we will need to answer is whether it has led to the establishment of a saving culture for those who had previously not saved or who had not saved through the formal financial system.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000027"></a>We hope and expect that some of the larger credit unions will offer saving gateway accounts. Officials have been in detailed discussions with their representative bodies.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000028"></a>I think that I have answered most, if not all, of the questions raised in debate. As I said at the start, these regulations will be an important part of the legislative framework for the new national saving gateway accounts to be introduced next year. I am delighted that they have received support from all sides of the House and am grateful, once again, to noble Lords who contributed both to today&#146;s debate and during the passage of the Bill. I express my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for their contributions. In a number of cases, as I have shown, we have taken on board their very helpful contributions, as a result of which we have a better Act and a better set of regulations.</p>

This order contained a  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>direction to the financial sector requiring it to cease all business with two Iranian entities&#151;Bank Mellat and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines&#151;and all their branches, wherever located.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000030"></a>In keeping with the undertakings given to Parliament during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, today I shall set out the reasons for this action, provide some details on the specifics of the direction and finally outline the work that we have done to ensure that these measures are well understood by the UK financial services industry. Due to the nature of the material that informed the decision to take this action, noble Lords will understand that there are limits on what can be shared. I will, of course, provide as much as is possible within these constraints.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000031"></a>The direction contained in this order was given on the basis of the Treasury&#146;s belief that the activity of Iran that facilitates the development or production of nuclear weapons poses a significant risk to the national interests of the UK. As the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury highlighted in her Written Statement to Parliament issued alongside the order on 12 October, Iran continues to fail to meet its international obligations. Most notably, its nuclear programme presents an immediate challenge to the global non-proliferation regime. Work being carried out as part of Iran&#146;s nuclear programme would facilitate the development or production of nuclear weapons.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000032"></a>The International Atomic Energy Agency is being refused the access that it seeks by Iran, which also declines to answer questions put to it by the agency&#146;s staff about alleged studies indicative of military aspects to Iran&#146;s programme. As a result, the IAEA director-general has stated that he is unable to verify that Iran&#146;s nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes. Iran&#146;s ongoing improvement of its ballistic missile capabilities also continues to give rise to international concern. Its failure to answer questions from the IAEA about possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme increases concerns that its ballistic missile programme represents a potential nuclear delivery system.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000033"></a>The Government consider the requirement to cease business relationships and transactions with Bank Mellat and IRISL to be a proportionate response to the threat. This is because the direction focuses on two entities that we have evidence have been engaged in activities of concern. Bank Mellat has provided banking services to a UN-listed organisation connected to Iran&#146;s proliferation-sensitive activities and was involved in transactions relating to financing Iran&#146;s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. IRISL has transported goods for both Iran&#146;s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Both have links to the UK financial sector. As such, this is a targeted action against two Iranian entities that have been identified as facilitating proliferation-sensitive activity in Iran, rather than a sanction against Iran.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000034"></a>To protect the national interests of this country and the integrity of our financial sector, this direction prohibits any financial or credit institution from providing services that benefit these entities and thereby support the activities in which they are engaged. This action  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was taken under Schedule 7 to the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, which provides the Treasury with powers to issue a range of directions to UK financial and credit institutions in response to certain risks to the UK&#146;s national interests. The direction to cease business relationships and transactions is the most stringent direction that can be employed under these powers in relation to the two targeted entities. The direction to cease business relationships and transactions with Bank Mellat and IRISL therefore addresses the risk that UK financial firms are, inadvertently or otherwise, used to facilitate activities of concern.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000035"></a>Let me now provide further information on the operation of the restrictions. The requirement contained in the direction came into force on Monday 12 October 2009. Shortly after the restrictions came into effect, the Treasury published a series of documents on its public website to alert the financial sector to the restrictions and provide detailed guidance on their implementation. These documents were also e-mailed to over 8,000 subscribers to our e-mail alert system. In addition, we have asked various supervisors&#151;for instance, the FSA and HMRC&#151;and trade organisations, such as the British Bankers&#146; Association, to publicise the direction and provide information to firms on the requirements in the direction. The Treasury has also met with those firms most affected by the direction to ensure that they are in a position to comply with the requirements.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000036"></a>The documents published by the Treasury on 12 October included three general licences exempting specific acts from the restrictions, which were issued by the Treasury under powers in Schedule 7. These general licences enable financial and credit institutions with existing business relationships or transactions with the entities concerned to manage the cessation of business in an orderly and controlled way. Further licences, whether general or individual, may be granted by the Treasury to manage the impact of the requirements on third parties. This approach is similar to that used in asset freezing.</p>
<h5><a name="09110213000072"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="91102-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000037"></a>The direction applies requirements to persons operating in the UK financial sector. This includes FSA-authorised firms, money service businesses and credit institutions. Firms are required to establish whether any current or future business relationships or transactions are affected and to take steps to comply with the requirements of the direction. In this case, firms will review their business dealings, cease any business relationships and transactions that are prohibited by the direction and ensure that their systems and controls are adequate for ongoing compliance with the direction. The use of existing procedures and systems that firms will have in place to meet obligations relating to financial sanctions and anti-money-laundering should assist in minimising the burden of compliance.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000038"></a>All institutions operating in the financial sector will need to ensure that they do not undertake new transactions or enter into new business relationships with the two entities. It is expected that compliance costs for the sector as a whole will be moderate, although any institution with significant links to Bank Mellat or

As set out during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Bill, supervision of the financial sector&#146;s compliance with this direction will form part of the existing supervisory regime.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000039"></a>Alongside work with our financial sector to implement the restrictions, the Government have also taken steps to ensure that other jurisdictions are vigilant to the risks posed by Iran. We have lobbied a wide range of international partners to highlight the action that we have taken and we have strongly encouraged them to take steps to prevent any business displaced from the UK from being picked up by their financial sector. We have worked with the Crown dependencies and overseas territories to develop legislation equivalent to the Counter-Terrorism Act to address these risks. Atishoo! I beg your pardon.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000042"></a>All the Crown dependencies and overseas territories have recognised the importance of tackling these risks and have made progress in this regard. I am pleased to report that the Isle of Man has already put equivalent powers in place and that on 12 October it issued a direction mirroring that of the UK. We will continue to pursue this important work with the other Crown dependencies and overseas territories.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000043"></a>I conclude by emphasising that the order was issued by the Government to address risks to the UK&#146;s national interests. We continue, of course, to ensure that any action taken by HM Treasury against Iranian entities is consistent with the wider foreign policy strategy towards Iran and we have worked closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the issuing of these directions. As such, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that we cannot and will not ignore specific activities undertaken by Iranian companies that we believe to be facilitating activity identified by the United Nations as being of concern and where such activities have the potential to affect the United Kingdom&#146;s interests. It is right, indeed crucial, that we take such action. For these reasons, I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000044"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110213000088"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order. I should state at the outset that we support the Government in their endeavour to impair the ability of Iran to pursue its dangerous nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000045"></a>I start with some of the background to the order. My honourable friend Mark Hoban asked the Minister in another place when the Government first became aware that IRISL vessels had transported goods for Iran&#146;s ballistic weapons and nuclear programmes. He reminded the Minister that my right honourable friend William Hague wrote to the Foreign Secretary in September 2008 asking him to take action against IRISL. I fear that the Minister did not give a straight answer last week, so I am hoping that the Minister today will take the opportunity of our Grand Committee to set the record straight.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000046"></a>When were the Government first aware that IRISL was involved in transporting goods for Iran&#146;s nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes? When were the Government first aware that Bank Mellat had provided banking services to UN-listed organisations connected to Iran&#146;s proliferation-sensitive activities and involved in transactions related to the financing of Iran&#146;s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes? The Written Ministerial Statement<I></I>made on 12 October made categorical statements that these activities had taken place. The Minister was similarly clear today. When did those transactions take place and when were the Government aware of them? What, if any, delay was there between the Government&#146;s knowledge of the transactions and their action by way of the order before us this afternoon? To put that another way, how can the Minister reassure this Committee that the Government have acted in the most expeditious way?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000047"></a>I ask these questions because my right honourable friend William Hague raised questions with the Government about IRISL more than a year before this order. Furthermore, the US acted in relation to IRISL last year. The Minister in another place tried to avoid answering these questions on security grounds, but I am asking not about the source or nature of the intelligence but about the timing and timeliness of action by the Government, given that the involvement of IRISL was clearly not a secret.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000048"></a>As to the impact of this order, the Explanatory Memorandum states that no specific information was available on the exposure of the UK&#146;s financial sector to IRISL and Bank Mellat. That may well have been the case prior to the making of the order&#151;and I imply no criticism by raising this today&#151;but it is now over three weeks since the order was made and the Treasury must by now have gained some understanding of the transactions that are prohibited by the order and their impact on our financial services sector. The Minister in another place did not answer this question straightforwardly and I hope that our Minister will be more forthcoming. For example, can he tell us the volume and value of transactions with the two organisations that are now prohibited?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000049"></a>Last week, the Minister in another place said that the Treasury had received 17 applications for licences and that two had been granted on a temporary basis. Is that still the position? What is the value of transactions covered by the applications for licence? What sorts of transactions are now being conducted under temporary licence and what is their value? Are these for transactions with IRISL or with Bank Mellat? I hope that the Minister can give more information.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000050"></a>I wish to probe another area that the Minister did not answer very illuminatingly last week. My honourable friend Mark Hoban asked whether any subsidiaries or affiliates of IRISL or Bank Mellat should have been covered by the order and noted that the US Government included IRISL affiliates when they acted against IRISL last year. The Minister in another place said that there was no evidence in respect of other companies in the IRISL or Bank Mellat groups&#151;I use that term colloquially. However, that seems to beg the question: what is the effectiveness of an order against one company if UK financial services firms can carry on similar  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries? It seems to me that that places the Government in a position of for ever playing catch-up. Is that indeed the effect of the powers created by the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008? Can the Minister explain the rationale of the approach to subsidiaries and similar bodies? Alternatively, he might wish to explain to the Committee if the Government&#146;s powers to deal with threats to the UK are in some ways deficient. I would be surprised if that were the case given the zeal with which the Government have used the time of Parliament over the past decade to pass counterterrorism and similar legislation.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000051"></a>I would also like to ask the Minister about supervision and enforcement. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the impact on the FSA&#146;s work is expected to be minimal. Does that imply that the FSA will do no more than ask questions? Will it take no specific action to assure itself that the transactions prohibited by this order are not taking place? On the other hand, HMRC estimates that it will spend upfront costs of &#163;20,000 and ongoing costs of two officers costing around &#163;65,000 in total. If we assume that that cost includes the full employment cost of those two individuals, we are probably not talking about very senior staff. What are these officers intended to do in relation to the programme? Will they carry out individual inspections? How and when will they do this? In what ways are they qualified to do such work?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000052"></a>The order will last for only one year and it is clearly important that Parliament should be given an opportunity to assess its impact, especially if the Government seek to extend it for a further period. The impact assessment notes that a report is made annually to Parliament on the use of the Counter-Terrorism Act powers generally. Will the Minister explain the way in which such a report will deal with this order? Will it be confined to the impact on UK financial services organisations or will it go more widely and assess its impact on Iran&#146;s proliferation activities? I am aware that the order is but one in a series of actions taken globally in relation to Iran, which may make the ultimate impact difficult to identify. However, I hope that it will have the effect of prohibiting specific transactions and that the Minister will share with the Committee how Parliament can expect to receive information on what the order has stopped and the costs imposed in achieving that.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000053"></a>We do not oppose the aims of the order&#151;far from it. If anything, our instincts are that action could and should have been taken earlier. However, while we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Government on the fight against Iran&#146;s nuclear and missile ambitions, the Minister will not expect us to accept explanations of the Government&#146;s actions and the impact of the order that are less than forthcoming. In that light, I hope that he can enlighten us further.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000054"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110213000089"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the background to the order. We agree with the Government that sanctions of this kind are worth while in attempting to rein in Iran&#146;s nuclear proliferation activities. Whether they have an impact on Iran&#146;s nuclear ambitions more generally is rather moot, but it is clear that making it more difficult for Iran to carry them out must be in the national interest.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000055"></a>I have only two questions. One is about any other operations that the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines might be undertaking in the UK that are not covered by the order, as the order covers relations with the financial services body. Shipping lines are likely to be working with other bodies that are not covered within the remit of financial restrictions, such as other shipping lines and customs bodies. Is there anything to stop the IRISL carrying on relations with other, non-financial bodies in the UK?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000056"></a>The second question has to do with international action against the two organisations. The Minister spoke about efforts to ensure that overseas territories and Crown dependencies were taking similar action, and he mentioned some of them, but is he aware of any action being taken within the rest of the EU? The Explanatory Memorandum mentions other Iranian banks&#151;for instance, Bank Saderat, Bank Sepah and Bank Melli&#151;which are clearly covered by an EU prohibition. Nothing in the documentation explains whether that applies here, or whether, for some reason, this is a unilateral move by the EU. It is not clear to me without having read EU regulation 1110/2008&#151;for which I apologise to the Committee&#151;where this action fits in relation to it. Is there any reason to believe that the organisations are actively engaged in trade elsewhere in Europe and that equivalent action is being taken to stop such trade continuing? With those two minor caveats, however, we support the order and look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000057"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110213000090"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, this has been an interesting and informative debate. I thank all noble Lords for their attendance and questions today. I hope that all noble Lords will agree that the decision to issue this direction is a proportionate and reasonable response to the threat of proliferation and that this action mitigates the risk of the UK financial system being used to facilitate proliferation-sensitive activities in Iran. It is vital that the UK takes action to ensure that its financial sector is not employed in this manner and the Government are committed to putting in place all necessary steps to ensure that that is the case. I welcome the support expressed by both the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on behalf of the Conservative Opposition, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for the actions that are being taken by the Government in connection with Iran. We are greatly encouraged by the fact that there is unanimity on the need to take a robust line.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000058"></a>The noble Baroness asked when we first became aware that there were problems with the involvement of Bank Mellat and IRISL in activities related to terrorism and nuclear proliferation. I am afraid that details of the sensitive information underlying the restriction cannot be provided since, in the Government&#146;s view, disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. However, I can assure the Committee that we took action as quickly as was appropriate, given the young age of the legislation.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000059"></a>Members will be aware that the Counter-Terrorism Act came into force in November 2008. Immediately following its enactment, HM Treasury initiated discussions with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to consider the most appropriate cases for this use. As noble Lords  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will appreciate, before we decided to issue this direction under the Act, it was crucial to follow a robust process to gather and analyse relevant intelligence and to ensure a sound legal basis for any action. Furthermore, it was important to ensure that Parliament had sufficient opportunity to consider the direction. I assure noble Lords that the Treasury laid this direction at the earliest appropriate opportunity.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000060"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the level of engagement between UK financial institutions and the two targeted entities. A small number of financial institutions had significant existing business relationships with the two target entities. We are working closely with the affected parties to ensure that they are implementing the restriction and that their previous relationship is wound down in an orderly fashion. The majority of UK financial sector companies voluntarily withdrew from business with Iran over the last two or three years.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000061"></a>In answer to a further question from the noble Baroness, since the announcement that 17 applications for licences had been granted, two further licences have been granted. The Treasury continues to work with affected parties to issue licences of exemption where appropriate. It is not possible at this point to place a value&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09110213000062"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110213000091"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I think that the Minister said that 17 licences had been granted. Does that mean 17 applications or 17 licences granted? I believe that the Committee in another place was told last week that two temporary licences had been granted out of a total of 17 applications. It is interesting if 17 licences have now been granted.</p>

<p><a name="09110213000063"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110213000092"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Seventeen applications were received; two further applications have been received since. It is not possible, as I was saying, to place a value on these transactions.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000064"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about subsidiaries of Bank Mellat and IRISL. The powers under which the direction was made address specific risks to the UK national interest posed by activities carried out by the Government or persons resident or incorporated in a third country. Subsidiaries are separate legal entities, not subject to the requirements of the direction. We are confident that the direction, as far as it applies to Bank Mellat and IRISL, will be sufficient in itself to achieve the objective that we have in seeking these orders.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000065"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the impact on business volumes and values. As I said, the majority of British financial institutions have already terminated their business activities, that particularly being the case with any UK institution having substantial business activities in the United States of America. We therefore expect the aggregate impact on the UK financial services sector to be quite modest. However, some firms will be more affected than others, which is why we are working closely with those firms to ensure an orderly wind-down of their existing business. We will publish updated impact analysis to include estimated volumes and values when the position is clearer.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000066"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about enforcement. The indication that I have given of the quantum of activities likely to be covered by the order would be  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consistent with the relatively modest costs that the FSA and HMRC believe are necessary for supervision and enforcement. It is important to recognise that these are estimates. If, during the course of their work, the FSA and HMRC form the view that they are required to be more engaged and searching and the issues that surface are more complex, I have no doubt that they would devote more resources to the task&#151;that is to say, they will not be resource-constrained in their ability to monitor and enforce these orders.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000067"></a>The order will last for one year. If the Government wish to come back to Parliament with a request for a renewal or a new order, that will no doubt be supported by a much fuller report to Parliament on the experience of the existing order. It is difficult to contemplate the precise form and content of that statement, as it will depend on the experience during the 12-month period. However, it will be entirely reasonable and proper for Parliament to expect as full as possible an explanation at that time of the experience to date, as would be consistent with national security interests.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about the engagement of UK bodies outside the financial services sector with Bank Mellat and IRISL. That is a perfectly reasonable question, but the scope of this legislation is very specific and focused on financial institutions. Noble Lords can rest assured that the appropriate bodies in the UK are monitoring closely our engagement with those two organisations. No doubt, the order as proposed will lead others to reflect on whether Bank Mellat and IRISL are organisations with which they would wish to continue to conduct business. Importantly, we need to continue to work hard to ensure that other jurisdictions are as determined as the UK is in this respect. I am thinking here of IRISL in the field of reinsurance and insurance, when clearly it would not achieve our ultimate purpose if the business currently transacted through P&amp;I institutions in the UK simply rotated to P&amp;I institutions or insurers elsewhere. Hence, there has to be an element of significant international co-operation.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110213000069"></a>That takes me to address the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, in connection with the European Union. These orders are a specific response to a threat to the UK. We will discuss the issue with our EU partners and will support those member states that wish to take similar action. It is clear from the evidence that, inasmuch as we can argue that these two organisations represent a threat to UK national interests, they similarly represent a threat to the national interests of other EU states.</p>

<p><a name="09110219000001"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09110219000041"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My Lords, the orders before us today relating to elections in Northern Ireland make small but important updates that are necessary to further assist the overall restructuring of local government in Northern Ireland. Noble Lords will be aware that the number of district councils in Northern Ireland is being reduced from 26 to 11. For this reason, this House agreed to the postponement of local elections in Northern Ireland until 2011 to allow time for the new local government wards and boundaries to be redrawn.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000002"></a>The draft Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962 (Amendment) Order 2009 will postpone preparation of the next draft polling station scheme in Northern Ireland until 2010 to take account of the changes to wards and boundaries that I have referred to. Noble Lords may be aware that the purpose of a polling station scheme is to designate suitable buildings as polling stations in electoral wards. By virtue of Section 65 of the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962, the next draft scheme is due to be prepared and published in 2009. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that it would make sense for the next polling station scheme to be based on the new local government wards.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000003"></a>The legislation to implement the new ward boundaries has not yet been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly. I understand that it is anticipated that this legislation will be in force by the end of 2009. However, this would provide little or no time for a draft polling station scheme to be prepared and published in 2009, as currently required by law. The draft order would therefore postpone publication of the next draft scheme until 2010 and for subsequent schemes to be published every four years thereafter.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000004"></a>I turn to the draft District Electoral Areas Commissioner (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Order 2009. The Local Government Boundaries Commissioner recently submitted his final recommendations on proposed new wards and boundaries to the Minister for the Environment in the Northern Ireland Executive. The next step in the process requires the District Electoral Areas Commissioner, or DEAC, to submit recommendations to the Secretary of State on the grouping of wards within electoral areas for the purpose of holding local government elections under the proportional representation/single transferable vote system.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000005"></a>The conduct of the DEAC review is governed by the District Electoral Areas Commissioner (Northern Ireland) Order 1984. This legislation has not been substantially updated since 1984 and some minor amendments are required to bring the DEAC&#146;s procedures into line with the current procedures for other such reviews. The first concerns the period for making representations. The DEAC is required to publish provisional recommendations, and to hold public inquiries in respect of them, if representations are received from either 100 electors or a district council. However, paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the 1984 order provides for representations to be made within one month of the publication of the recommendations. I am concerned that this would not allow sufficient time for the relevant  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parties to make objections, particularly given the widespread changes that will need to be made as part of the current review. The draft order, therefore, extends this period to eight weeks, which is in line with the procedure followed by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000006"></a>Secondly, the 1984 order requires the DEAC to publish a notice setting out his provisional recommendations in newspapers circulating in the district. However, because of the wide-ranging nature of the current review, it is likely that the recommendations will be very detailed and could involve the production of large-scale maps. It would therefore be both costly and unwieldy to publish them in full in local newspapers. The draft order therefore provides the commissioner with the option of either publishing a notice setting out his recommendations or simply providing details of when and where the recommendations may be inspected, or both. This is also in line with the procedure followed by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000007"></a>Finally, as the number and boundaries of councils are due to change, it is important to clarify that it is existing councils most affected by any changes that can compel an inquiry, not the new 11 district councils that will come into being after the next local election. The draft order therefore provides that the objection of any council that will, in whole or in part, be incorporated by or incorporate the successor council will be sufficient to secure a local inquiry.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000008"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that these orders make small but important changes that are essential to ensuring the successful restructuring of local government in Northern Ireland. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000010"></a>I supported strongly the change from 26 to 11&#151;except that I would have preferred seven. I said that for the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney. However, we are in a time of change and I am not comfortable with the proposed dates. A great deal of change is going to take place. However, we are almost at the end of 2009 and it does not appear that the jobs that were supposed to have been completed by the end of 2009 are going to happen. We are into November, the parliamentary term ends within three weeks and I cannot see the expected changes taking place in 2009.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000011"></a>The order refers also to this taking place in 2010. Is it December 2010 or January 2010? It clearly probably is not January 2010, but the order does not give any indication within 12 months as to when it is expected. Paragraph 4.1 of the Explanatory Notes to the electoral law order states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110219000034"></a>&#147;This Order is needed to postpone the preparation of the draft polling station scheme that is due to take place in 2009 until 2010&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110219000033"></a>That could cover 24 months or, as it now stands, two months. Perhaps the Minister can provide clarity on that.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000012"></a>As to the DEAC&#146;s responsibilities for communication, the pragmatic approach of not forcing him to publish the preliminary offerings in the newspapers in order to save money seems very sensible, although the noble Lord opposite may not be terribly happy about that for other reasons. In principle, I agree with all that is being done and my comments are in no way a criticism of the DEAC, whom I have known for a number of years. However, I fear that the timescale lacks realism.</p>

<p><a name="09110219000013"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110219000043"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing these two orders. Regarding the first, although traditionally we on these Benches are sceptical about interfering with the usual practicalities that underpin the democratic process, in this case it is sensible to make an exception. It would be a waste of time, energy and resources to prepare a draft polling scheme for Northern Ireland before the review of boundaries for the 11 new local government districts has been finalised. Changes to boundaries could mean that previous arrangements are no longer suitable, or more appropriate polling stations could present themselves in a particular ward. We therefore support the first order.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000014"></a>I have slightly more points to make about the second order. We very much welcome the increase, from one month to eight weeks, of the period in which representations on the provisional recommendations can be made. However, we are a little concerned that the proposal will give the DEAC a choice of whether to publish the provisional recommendations or simply to make them available for inspection. As we know, Northern Ireland is undertaking a radical reorganisation of local government, moving from 26 borough councils to 11. There will naturally be a great deal of interest from the general public in how current wards will be organised and which new local council area they will find themselves living in. Given that this is such a radical change, and not simply a small shift in boundaries, it is important for the people of Northern Ireland to be able to assess and have access to this information as easily as possible.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000015"></a>Again, while we appreciate the costs involved in publishing the full provisional recommendations, we are concerned that simply making them available for inspection is not, by itself, sufficient. How will local people know that the recommendations are available for inspection? How will they know where and when to go to see them? It could be very difficult for some people in rural areas to travel to see the recommendations.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000016"></a>Finally, can the Minister at the very least assure the Committee that, if the DEAC decides just to make the recommendations available for inspection and not to publish locally, notification will be given in local newspapers so that local people will know that the recommendations are available to be looked at, and where and when they can do so? Can the Minister also assure the Committee that everything possible will be done to ensure that the recommendations are easily accessible for local people?</p>

<p><a name="09110219000017"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110219000044"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness for her presentation of the orders. I found the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Smith of Clifton, very interesting. It is interesting that the Conservative Party, together with the Ulster Unionist Party, now opposes the 11 new  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>district councils and would have required fewer councils. I deplore that position because, having worked as a member of a district council for many years, and living in the west of Ulster, I know that the compromise of 11 is the correct answer. To have had only seven or eight would have made the councils far too large for rural people, as has been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000020"></a>I welcome the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, about advertising. I declare an interest, which is fully recorded in the Register. I know something about this subject. I think that the noble Lord would agree that people in Northern Ireland take a tremendous interest in elections and who has the right to vote. They want to know what is happening. Of course, on this occasion there is to be a major upheaval in local government in Northern Ireland and they will be keen to know what is being proposed. I am sorry to hear, yet again, that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, wants to limit their ability to know what is going on behind their backs. He wants to reduce the publicity about the changes in local government in Northern Ireland. Perhaps on this occasion he will, once again, disassociate himself from the Ulster Unionists and the Conservative Party.</p>

<p><a name="09110219000021"></a>Advertising on radio and in weekly papers for all kinds of elections in Northern Ireland is now a matter of great concern within the media industry, which is very disturbed by the policy of the Government and the public agencies. They seem to be creating further problems as we go down the line of trying to reduce costs in electoral activities. No longer are government agencies getting value for money; more and more, they are involving a decreasing number of the population in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000022"></a>The most recent example is the European election. Postal vote applications were advertised on Classic FM, which is not one of the most popular radio stations in the west of Ulster; it may perhaps be very popular in North Down, but it is certainly not throughout the rest of the Province. They were also advertised in the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I>, which mainly circulates among the half a million or so people living in greater Belfast, not among the other 1,250,000 people living outside the city, and in the <I>News of the World</I>, which is not popular among many Protestants and Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. They were not advertised in the weekly papers that are read by the wider population in Northern Ireland. What was the net result? In the recent European election in Northern Ireland, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of people who applied for postal votes.</p>

<p><a name="09110219000023"></a>Paragraph 7 of the Explanatory Memorandum is entitled &#147;Policy Background&#148;. It refers to 100 electors. Is that 100 electors in the new district council areas or in the 26 district council areas?</p>

<p><a name="09110219000025"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09110219000048"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> That clears that up. The 26 district council areas vary greatly in size, from Moyle, which has about 10,000 people, to Belfast, which has maybe 250,000 people. That is why we are having a reorganisation of local government in Northern Ireland. It is essential that 100 people, or various groups of 100 people in each district council area, know what is being proposed. If there is just a little notice in the weekly paper stating that the information is available at some address, people will not follow it up. They have to see what is happening. There will be a lot of criticism if they do not know what is being recommended.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000026"></a>It is not often that I recommend something that applies in the Republic of Ireland, but I know what happens there, and it is quite sensible. Local weekly newspapers are contacted and asked to print a supplement at a special advertising rate. That works. I recommend that we apply that in Northern Ireland to involve as many of the population as possible in seeing what is happening and having the right to comment on it and to submit recommendations or alternatives.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000027"></a>It is important that these things go into local papers. For example, in Downpatrick, the local paper, the <I>Down Recorder</I>&#151;in which I have no interest&#151;sells more copies than the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I>, the <I>News Letter</I> and the <I>Irish News</I> combined. In Dungannon, more copies of the <I>Tyrone Courier</I> are sold than the <I>Belfast Telegraph, </I>the <I>News Letter</I> and the <I>Irish News</I> combined. Noble Lords can see the importance of weekly papers, as opposed to daily papers or papers such as the <I>News of the World</I>.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000028"></a>There is of course a suggestion&#151;in fact, it was an allegation, which is about to be followed up&#151;that there is a conflict of interest if an outside agency advises on advertising policy for elections in Northern Ireland. I know that a newspaper group, with which I have no association whatever, is concerned about current electoral advertising policy; it has now employed one of the universities to investigate present government advertising policy and to advise whether the Government are getting value for money. Its report will become available for debate here in Parliament and in the Northern Ireland Assembly at the beginning of next year.</p>

She referred to 1984 and I suspect that, if we look back to the relevant tome, she will find that I was in the position that she is in now without the knowledge that I gleaned during those years.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000030"></a>Many of the points that I had in mind concerning newspapers have been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney. I seem to recall that when my department&#151;the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, as it then was&#151;wished to promote various pieces of information, there was great panic in Belfast about the number of local organs of communication. The noble Lord mentioned the Belfast <I>News Letter</I> but, going even further west than Dungannon, he may  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be aware of the wide influence of the <I>Mid Ulster Mail</I>, not to mention the Tyrone<I></I><I>Democrat</I>. County Fermanagh has two newspapers: not just the <I>Im</I><I>partial </I><I>Reporter</I> but the <I>Fermanagh Herald</I>.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000031"></a>I believe that much of what the noble Lord suggested concerning special little supplements, with the co-operation of the local newspapers, will alleviate many of the problems that have been considered. What I have in mind, above all, are details concerning where and when one can vote. I wonder whether the Belfast<I> News Letter</I>, let alone the <I>Financial Times</I> or other great organs of world communication, is widely taken account of in Newtownstewart or elsewhere. The noble Lord should be careful: I am considered to be something of an intellectual in my home town because I take the <I>Financial Times</I> during the week. That may have something to do with the fact that I have time to read it here or on train journeys.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110219000032"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to take on board the excellent suggestion that local newspapers may be willing to help by producing a supplement. They are widely read and are very close to the polling stations and to what one might call the scene of the action. Therefore, they would probably be the best channel through which to promote exactly what she is trying to promote. I conclude by voicing my uncertainty about 2010, as my noble friend did so eloquently. Will it happen in December or the cold days of January?</p>

<p><a name="09110226000001"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09110226000018"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank all noble Lords for their comments. I think that in general noble Lords welcomed the orders but they obviously also raised significant concerns about some aspects. I start with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who asked whether the May 2011 election was still achievable and voiced his concerns about the reality of the timing. All those involved in the reorganisation of local government are working towards a May 2011 election. We are reassured by the fact that Edwin Poots, the Minister of the Environment in the Northern Ireland Executive, has indicated that he expects the Assembly to debate the legislation for which it is responsible by the end of the year. On 20 October 2009, he stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110226000014"></a>&#147;I am confident that, by working together, we will achieve our goals of creating 11 strong and effective councils in May 2011&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000012"></a>This will allow for the remaining stages of the review, including the DEAC review that we are discussing today, to be completed in time for a May 2011 election.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110226000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, expressed his concerns about the timing of the publication of the 2010 polling station scheme. The Polling Station Scheme Regulations 1972 set out in further detail when exactly a draft polling station scheme should be prepared in the relevant year. These regulations will be updated shortly and, therefore, I cannot give the noble Lord a specific answer as to whether it will be January or December. However, the regulations that will decide that will be updated shortly. We will, of course, relay the noble Lord&#146;s concerns over timing to the chief electoral officer.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110226000003"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Kilclooney, raised concerns about the removal of the requirement for DEAC to publish his recommendations in local newspapers. The noble Lords feel that this will make them less accessible to sections of the community.  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I emphasise that that is not the intention of the order. If anything, the intention is to increase accessibility. The DEAC must still give notice to newspapers circulating locally of where his provisional recommendations may be inspected and he may still, at his discretion, publish them in the newspapers. The suggestion of the noble Lords, Lord Kilclooney and Lord Smith, about providing an inset or a publication inside the newspaper will of course be passed on.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000004"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09110226000019"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I am concerned by the comment that the intention is to increase access for the public to these proposals. I hope that the noble Baroness took note of my comments on what happened in the recent European elections, when the same new advertising policy was pursued and resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of applications for postal votes.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000005"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09110226000020"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I take note of that. As a former MEP, like the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, I find it concerning; I do not like the sound of it at all. However, I suggest that the methods by which people access information are changing all the time. While I accept that many people will go to their local newspaper to find out what is happening electorally&#151;I accept also the high level and sophistication of electoral interest in Northern Ireland&#151;many will gain access through the website. The DEAC intends to publish his provisional recommendations on his website. He will make them available for viewing in DEAC offices, in libraries, in council offices and in local area offices. That will be made clear when he publishes the notice. Copies will also be provided to, for instance, groups that represent those with disabilities, who would find access even more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000006"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09110226000021"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> The point about the newspaper supplement idea and publishing in newspapers generally is that they have a tremendous reinforcing effect. When we see something on screen, it is instantaneous&#151;here today and gone tomorrow&#151;but when you have a newspaper that lies around the house for a week it is a constant memo to you to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000007"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09110226000022"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I absolutely agree with noble Lords that it is important that we get this right and get the message to as many potential electors as possible. I shall certainly raise the concerns expressed today about public awareness with the Electoral Commission. As noble Lords will know, the Electoral Commission has responsibility for raising public awareness&#151;it is one of the reasons for its existence&#151;in relation to postal voting and so on. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, referred to the recent European elections. Again, we come back to the role and responsibility of the Electoral Commission.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000008"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09110226000023"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> When the noble Baroness goes to bed, she can take her weekly newspaper with her, but not her computer.</p>

As they say, it is a matter of size&#151;you can sometimes get a lot of information on BlackBerrys&#151;but I take the noble Lord&#146;s point. The DEAC must still publish a notice saying where those recommendations may be inspected.  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, as I have said, the specific concerns that have been raised today will be passed on.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110226000010"></a>I have probably covered most points. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, spoke about advertising and raising public awareness of elections. I repeat that that is a matter for the Electoral Commission, to which we shall happily relay his views&#151;as well as his great experience from 1984, when he stood here.</p>

<p><a name="09110226000011"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09110226000025"></a>Lord Lyell:</b> The noble Baroness has been kind enough to refer to 1984. In fact, it was during my six summers in Northern Ireland that I became aware that one particular area may have more than just one newspaper. I mentioned County Fermanagh because when one&#151;it might have been me or perhaps my noble friend Lord King&#151;was putting out news in a communiqu&#233; from the Department of Agriculture to the <I>Fermanagh Herald</I>, which covered one particular but widely spread section of the community, and the <I>Impartial Reporter</I>, one had to transpose the photographs. Different communiqu&#233;s over matters such as pigs, cattle or calves would have to be given to different newspapers covering one county. I am sure that the Minister and the department will take good care of that. She has been very kind to lay to rest my worry that people would not be totally aware at a local level of what might be relevant. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Smith, put it beautifully when he said that, when something is broadcast on screen, via Ulster Television, for example&#151;or indeed on Downtown Radio&#151;it might be just here and there, whereas when it is in a newspaper you know that it is all there. However, the Minister has reassured me fully and I thank her very much.</p>

I shall also speak to the draft Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendments to Schedule 2) Order 2009, a copy of which was laid before this House on 12 October 2009. I welcome this opportunity to put these proposals before the Committee today. I will deal with the detail of each order in turn but, before doing so, I will provide context for the proposed amendments.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000002"></a>The fifth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission stated that there was direct evidence of paramilitary involvement in the private security industry in Northern Ireland, resulting in many firms suffering from extortion. It stated that the current, temporary control regime in Northern Ireland was less stringent than the regime in England, Wales and Scotland and was insufficient in preventing paramilitary infiltration of the industry.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000003"></a>The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee identified the potential for exploitation of the industry by paramilitaries and organised criminals. It recommended that the regulation of the private security industry in Northern Ireland be dealt with as a matter of priority. It also identified the need for appropriate training and registration of door supervisors and noted the problems with the form of self-regulation that is encouraged by some, but not all, councils throughout Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000004"></a>These reports led the Government to undertake a thorough review of the private security industry in Northern Ireland. A consultation document entitled <I>Regulating the Private Security Industry in Northern Ireland</I> was circulated to organisations representing the private security industry, political parties, relevant local authority organisations and a wide variety of other organisations that have an interest in or avail themselves of private security services. This document set out the options for regulation and highlighted the Government&#146;s preference to extend the remit of the Security Industry Authority, the regulatory body in England, Wales and Scotland, to Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000005"></a>The Government took into account all comments and views in relation to developing a new scheme of regulation for the industry in Northern Ireland. After carefully considering the options for regulation, the Government believed that, on balance, extending the remit of the SIA was the right way forward. The SIA is the organisation responsible for regulating the private security industry in Great Britain. It is an independent body reporting to the Home Secretary under the terms of the Private Security Industry Act 2001.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000006"></a>The aims of the SIA are to regulate the private security industry effectively and to reduce criminality, raise standards and recognise quality service. The SIA has two main duties. One is the compulsory licensing of individuals undertaking designated activities within the private security industry; the other is to manage the voluntary approved contractor scheme, which measures private security suppliers against independently assessed criteria.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000007"></a>SIA licensing covers manned guarding&#151;including security guarding, door supervision, close protection, cash and valuables in transit, and public space surveillance

Licensing ensures that private security operatives are fit and proper persons who are suitably trained and qualified to do their job. The approved contractor scheme introduced a set of operational and performance standards for suppliers of private security services. Those organisations that meet these standards are awarded approved contractor status. This accreditation provides purchasers of private security services with independent proof of the contractor&#146;s commitment to quality.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000008"></a>Using the SIA to regulate the private security industry in Northern Ireland will ensure that standards are equal throughout the UK and will increase the ability of Northern Ireland companies to operate and compete on a national basis. The SIA has the skills to support the regulatory system and offer the most cost-effective solution. The authority&#146;s multi-agency approach to compliance and enforcement activity sits well with the methods currently used in Northern Ireland and can be successful in tackling the problems of organised crime within the industry.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000009"></a>New regulatory arrangements under the SIA will represent a major step forward, for both the industry and the people of Northern Ireland. Extending the remit of the SIA will achieve the regulation that the industry wants and enhance safeguards for those operating legitimately, while targeting those acting outside the law. The overarching aim is to reduce offending in the private security industry by protecting people from crime and giving the public greater confidence in the industry.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000010"></a>The aim of the Northern Ireland Office is that the majority of activities that are currently designated under the 2001 Act in relation to England, Wales and Scotland will be designated in Northern Ireland from December 2009 onwards. The effect of the designation will be that these activities can be carried out legally in Northern Ireland only with an SIA licence. One important exception to this will be the work of in-house door supervisors, which will not be designated in Northern Ireland until April 2010, although it is currently a designated activity in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000011"></a>As part of the legislative process for the draft Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2009, which is made under Section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Minister gave evidence to the ad hoc committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Having listened to the committee&#146;s concerns about the effective date for licensing of in-house door supervisors from 1 December 2009, he agreed that individuals in this sector will now be expected to have a licence by April 2010.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000012"></a>I turn briefly now to the detail of the provisions contained in the two draft orders. The technical amendments contained in the two draft orders are needed to ensure that the 2001 Act takes account of Northern Ireland legislation and operates in Northern Ireland as it does in the rest of the United Kingdom. I will deal first with the detail of the draft Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2009. As I have previously advised, this

An order making amendments thus has to be approved by the affirmative resolution procedure. It is to seek that approval that I have brought this measure before the Committee this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="09110239000013"></a>As required under Section 85(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the draft order was considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly and its report was published on 29 June. The Government have welcomed proposals from all stakeholders, including the Northern Ireland Assembly, during implementation and have endeavoured to be adaptable while crucially not losing sight of the benefits of a consistent UK-wide approach. The Northern Ireland Assembly did not specifically recommend any modification of the content of the draft order and, as such, none has been made.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000014"></a>The first amendment of the draft order relates to an exemption in Section 4 of the 2001 Act for those working in certain sports grounds for any requirement to hold a licence under the Act. The exemption does not currently apply in Northern Ireland, as it is defined by reference to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, neither of which extends to Northern Ireland. The amendment will extend the exemption to Northern Ireland by adding references to the equivalent Northern Ireland legislation, the Safety of Sports Grounds (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000015"></a>The second amendment relates to Schedule 2, which lists the various activities that can be designated under the 2001 Act. One of the activities listed in Schedule 2 is the work of door supervisors or other security personnel in licensed premises. The definition of &#147;licensed premises&#148; in the schedule currently refers only to licensed premises in England, Wales and Scotland. The amendment will add references to licensed premises in Northern Ireland, ensuring that door supervisors in Northern Ireland will be subject to the same licensing requirements as apply to door supervisors working in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000016"></a>A copy of the draft Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendments to Schedule 2) Order 2009 was laid before the House on 12 October 2009. The purpose of the instrument is to amend Schedule 2 of the 2001 Act. As I have explained, Schedule 2 lists the activities that may be designated under the 2001 Act. In addition, it sets out a number of exceptions to the licensing regime. The instrument covered by this memorandum will amend Schedule 2 to take account of Northern Ireland legislation by adding a number of new exceptions to the licensing regime and by amending the definition of roads, local authorities and licensed premises used in the schedule.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000017"></a>The 2001 Act makes provision for the Secretary of State to amend this schedule. Such amendments have to be approved by the affirmative resolution procedure. It is to seek that approval that I have brought this measure before the Committee today. The effect will be that the licensing regime under the Act will operate in Northern Ireland as it does in the rest of the United Kingdom. In particular, it will ensure that the requirement to hold a licence for manned guarding does not catch

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000018"></a>The order will limit the requirement that certain door supervisors working in licensed premises hold an SIA licence to cover times only when alcohol is being sold or entertainment is taking place. It will also ensure that those working as door supervisors in licensed premises that are being used for bingo or theatrical performances or for showing films are not required to hold a door supervisor licence. Finally, it will make a minor technical amendment to ensure that the definition of roads and local authorities in Schedule 2 are correct for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000019"></a>The private security sector is one on which many of us rely for our personal security and safety and for the security of our business, our property and our possessions. SIA regulation is tried and tested and robust. By introducing it in Northern Ireland in a way that is consistent with the rest of the United Kingdom, the Government believe that it will successfully discourage criminal activity within the industry and provide further opportunities for local companies. The minor and technical amendments proposed to the 2001 Act by these instruments will ensure appropriate and proportionate consistency. I commend the orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09110239000020"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110239000029"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that lengthy and carefully thought through explanation of the orders that we are debating. I support them in principle. I declare an interest as a consultant to a security firm based in Whitehall. I took part in all the debates during the passage of the Bill in 2001, so I am familiar with and confident about the SIA procedure. We debated the Bill long and hard in lots of detail and got a number of concessions from and agreements with the Government. I felt that it was a good Bill by the time it was finished.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110239000021"></a>I made a nuisance of myself about guards and supervisors in relation to sport. I remember the argument about major golf tournaments, hockey tournaments or other tournaments having to have supervisors, superintendents or whatever one cares to call them. Clubs and people promoting these games would not have been able to afford the cost because in order to get an SIA licence you have to do a considerable amount of training, take exams and so on, and somebody has to pay for that. I would like to hear from the Minister that amateur sport, if using amateur, unpaid monitors or stewards, does not come under the SIA regime. I brought professional golf back to Northern Ireland in the 1990s for the first time post-IRA and ended up with the British PGA Senior Open being played at Portrush, where we had thousands of people. Every green and tee has to have stewards. If events

I would like to be encouraged to believe that they have been excepted.</p>

Paragraph 4.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Private Security Industry Act order says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110242000013"></a>&#147;The aim of the Home Office and the NIO is that the majority of activities that are currently designated under the 2001 Act in relation to England and Wales and Scotland will be designated in Northern Ireland&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110242000011"></a>The word &#147;majority&#148; slightly puzzled me. I wondered what the exceptions were and what had been omitted. Apart from that, we should welcome the movement of the SIA into Northern Ireland and hope that it will be successful when operating there.</p>

<p><a name="09110242000002"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110242000021"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing these orders. Policing the private security industry can be very problematic, particularly given the special circumstances of Northern Ireland. Indeed, in the murkier parts of the industry it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between protection rackets on the one hand and legitimate security activities on the other&#151;hence the need for these orders.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000003"></a>I should like to ask the Minister about some of the recommendations of the report from the Northern Ireland Assembly. Although I recognise that none of the Assembly&#146;s recommendations required a change to the orders, we hope that the Minister can say something about the Government&#146;s response to those recommendations. In addition, is she satisfied that the SIA will be able to cope with the additional workload that will come as a result of the extension to Northern Ireland? Will there be any additional short-term funding to help the SIA as it expands its activities? Do the Government still intend to press ahead with implementation in December, as I think the Minister confirmed? As we know, the Assembly report recommended slowing down the process of extending to Northern Ireland the scheme that exists here. It would be helpful to know of any further discussions that have taken place in relation to this matter. Again, that is particularly important given the Assembly&#146;s concern in relation to the costs of the scheme.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000004"></a>One major concern of the Assembly committee was the high cost&#151;&#163;245&#151;of obtaining a licence for door staff compared with current local arrangements, which cost around &#163;30. However, the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110242000014"></a>&#147;Time constraints do not allow the Committee to enter into an investigation into the differences. But differences there are and we feel that it is unwise to make decisions on the basis of such disputed information and that this argues further for a slow down in decision making until a fuller consideration of these issues has taken place. &#145;Costs&#146; are an extremely important consideration for all of the stakeholders.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110242000015"></a>The Committee in the timescale available has not been able to make a judgment on whether the local schemes are comparable in terms of quality with the SIA delivered arrangements. More importantly we do not have reliable evidence on the comparable effectiveness and value-for-money of the main competing options and on which is of best value to the public purse&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110242000012"></a>Given the concern expressed by the Assembly committee with regard to costs&#151;an issue that is particularly important to businesses in the current economic situation&#151;will the Government consider a delay in the implementation of the scheme to allow the Assembly to investigate this matter fully?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000005"></a>My final point relates to the Assembly&#146;s concern that it did not have sufficient time to scrutinise the order in as much detail as it would have liked. Will the Minister give consideration to extending the length of time for orders to be scrutinised or, given that the Assembly&#146;s recesses do not always coincide with those of Parliament, will she give a commitment to amend Section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act to qualify that the 60-day period does not include days when the Assembly is not sitting?</p>

<p><a name="09110242000006"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110242000022"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank noble Lords for their contributions. I start by responding to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who wanted reassurance on aspects of an SIA licence regime regarding sports events. I hope that I shall be able to reassure him by saying that there will be no need for an SIA licence at a sporting event provided that any of the following conditions apply. The first is where the security staff are in-house and not contract staff and where the venue is not licensed to sell alcohol or provide regulated entertainment. The second is where the staff are volunteers. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who takes an interest in sport in Northern Ireland, talked about volunteers at sporting events and so on. Within HMRC guidelines, such volunteers cannot receive payment or benefits in kind but they can be paid reasonable expenses. Thirdly, if a certain part of a sports ground or stand is already covered by a safety certificate, there is no requirement for any in-house staff to have a licence, even if they work in an area with a licence to sell alcohol or provide entertainment. I hope that those three points will give the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, the reassurance that he seeks.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000007"></a>I turn now to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, who raised a number of issues on cost and timing. He referred to the importance of costs and to the ability of the SIA to cope with the expected applications. There is a cost to individuals associated with licensing, but there is no desire to impose unnecessary hardship. The cost of a licence application is reasonable and justifiable. It is also consistent with the charge levied in the rest of the United Kingdom. This needs to be viewed in context. Most licences cost &#163;245 and last for three years; at slightly more than &#163;1.50 a week for a licence, that is a comparatively small price to pay to provide a level of reassurance to the general public that those operating in the private security industry are vetted and trained professionally to a high standard.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, was also concerned about the SIA&#146;s ability to cope with the expected applications. I hope that I reassure him when  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I say that the SIA is currently receiving and processing some 4,500 to 5,000 applications per week in Great Britain. The forecast for the total licensable population of Northern Ireland is some 9,500, which represents approximately 3 per cent of the total UK licensable population. The SIA has reassured us that it does not feel that that would cause any notable strain on the licensing processes. The SIA aims to process 80 per cent of all licence applications within 40 days. The most recent available statistic showed that, in September, it processed 98 per cent of all properly completed licence applications within that timeframe.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000009"></a>The noble Lord also raised the issue of the Assembly&#146;s consideration of the order. The Minister considered the points raised by the Assembly committee and took on board concerns raised about the time given to consider the draft order. We met the statutory obligations in regard to this, but the point is taken that it was a matter of concern for the committee. The Minister listened to the concerns raised by the ad hoc committee about the timing of the legislation and has decided that in-house door supervisors will now be expected to have a licence by April 2010, not December 2009.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110242000010"></a>With that, I hope that I have answered noble Lords&#146; questions.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000001"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09110247000059"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the Government on the excellent family and child-based legislation that they have introduced over the past few years. However, the order to which I speak, regrettably, is not in that group. The purpose of my Motion is to bring to the attention of the House criticisms of the Ministry of Justice and of the Legal Services Commission in relation to their process of consultation over decisions on the legally funded fees of family barristers and the impact their decisions will have upon vulnerable families going through the family courts and on the family Bar, particularly on women barristers and especially on BME women who appear for these families under public funding. These criticisms have been supported by the Justice Committee of the House of Commons in its 8th report of July 2009, and by the Merits Committee, of which I am a member, in its 25th report of Session 2008-09.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000002"></a>Very shortly, the background is given in paragraph 9 of the Justice Committee&#146;s report, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110247000041"></a>&#147;Much of the debate about family legal aid reform inevitably revolves around fees and payments, which give the impression that the issues are solely about how much to pay lawyers. It is all too easy to lose sight of the overall purpose of family legal aid which is the provision of a service to families, and particularly to children, to enable them to gain access to justice and to help them navigate effectively through an increasingly complex system. The families, and particularly the children, involved are often confused, emotionally damaged and vulnerable. As Lord Laming stated in his progress report on child protection in the wake of the Baby Peter case: &#145;Children are our future. We depend on them growing up to become fulfilled citizens well able to contribute successfully to family life and to the wider society. It is of fundamental importance that the life and future development of each child is given equal importance. Every child needs to be nurtured and protected from harm&#146;. Family legal aid is part of this nurturing and protection and provides a vital service for vulnerable families and children. Their need for this service is as basic as their need for health, education and social services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000032"></a>In 2008 the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000045"></a>&#147;were it not for the quality of children lawyers that we have at work in this country, then the vital job [they] do would not be done, children and families would not be represented, miscarriages of justice would be the norm, the children themselves would suffer, and the state would end up footing a far greater bill, socially as well as financially, in consequence&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000003"></a>Most of the family Bar belong to the Family Law Bar Association, which has something like 2,300 members, 61 per cent of whom are women. They are at the sharp end of the family justice system. A large percentage of the family Bar does publicly funded work, paid by the family graduated fees scheme since 2001. It is usually called the FGFS, and I shall call it that, although I notice in the Minister&#146;s latest report it has now been changed to the FGF.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000004"></a>The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission produced a consultation paper in June 2008, <I>Reforming the Legal Aid Family Barrister Fee Scheme</I>, which proposed cuts of &#163;13 million to family fees over two years&#151;that is, the FGFS. In December 2008 there was a further consultation paper from the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission which made various proposals for fixed fees and further average cuts of 20 to 30 per cent and, in more complex cases, up to 50 per cent. The system, according to the Family Law Bar Association, would over-reward simple hearings and under-reward complex cases.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000005"></a>There has been great concern among the Bar Council and the FLBA about the reliability and misclassification of underlying data. In February this year, the Minister made a decision on the June 2008 consultation paper that there would be cuts of &#163;13 million over two years to effect public law and private law children cases and financial relief cases, which are called ancillary relief. These cuts are in the statutory instrument about which I ask your Lordships to take note.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000006"></a>There had been discussions between the FLBA and the LSC, which accepted that the evidence was based upon anecdotes and not upon research. Therefore, in March 2009, at a late stage, Ernst &amp; Young were instructed by the LSC to investigate and report.</p>
<h5><a name="09110247000054"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000007"></a>In March, the FLBA got an important report, <I>The Work of the Family Bar</I> by Dr Debora Price of the King&#146;s Institute for the Study of Public Policy. It included responses from 1,600 barristers that showed that something like 40 per cent of senior barristers of over 16 years&#146; call were likely to give up legally funded work or much reduce it. The report demonstrated the serious situation that would exist if these cuts were implemented. There was further discussion with the Minister about the reliability of the underlying data, and he extended the consultation period to April. The real concerns of the Family Law Bar Association were over the late use of economic experts and the failure to inform the stakeholders at a much earlier time. At that time, the report was not expected to be ready until August, which was when the Government would give their decision.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000008"></a>The Legal Services Commission said that the economic research of Ernst &amp; Young was not fundamental to the structure of the scheme. However, in giving evidence to the Justice Committee of the other place, it conceded that an assessment of the impact on suppliers of its proposals, part of the Ernst &amp; Young study, was important because a substantial drop in supply would cause a significant problem, and the study was fundamental to the decision on whether the new fees scheme went ahead. When talking about supply, we are talking about the Bar being available to do the cases.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000009"></a>The Minister refused an extension of time and the FLBA and other major stakeholders responded to the second consultation paper in April. The Minister then offered to share the conclusions of the Ernst &amp; Young report by the end of June. The decision on the December consultation was to be given on 14 August. As your Lordships will see, the whole thing was very rushed. On 16 June, the Justice Select Committee held a hearing at which evidence was given by a considerable number of people, including me and members of the Legal Services Commission. The Justice Select Committee had been very critical of the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000010"></a>At the end of June, the Ernst &amp; Young report was circulated. By 16 July, the FLBA got out a report by Oxera, which was critical of much of the Ernst &amp; Young report. One particular point it challenged was the finding of excess supply. Oxera suggested that it

How Ernst &amp; Young got to excess supply foxes me with what I know about what the Bar is saying about this. On 4 August, the statutory instrument before the Committee was implemented.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000011"></a>The Government have asserted that there was a significant rise in the costs of the family graduated fees scheme. Paragraph 7.12 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the statutory instrument states,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000046"></a>&#147;legal aid payments to family barristers have risen unsustainably over the five years from 2003-04 to 2007-08&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110247000033"></a>That seems a considerable exaggeration. I will give your Lordships the figures in a moment. The Merits Committee questioned the ministry about the statutory instrument and the lack of an impact assessment attached to the Explanatory Memorandum. We were told that family barrister fees were nearly &#163;100 million. The Family Law Bar Association answered the Government figures and stated that the &#163;100 million includes non-FGFS payments, such as payments in the magistrates' courts and other payments that are not to be treated as part of the FGFS. The Government have taken into account the 8 per cent that they over-deducted in 2001 and put back in 2005. In addition, there has been an increase in the volume of cases. For example, everyone knows from the press how many additional cases have come in to the care side of the courts because of Baby Peter. In fact, the FGFS costs have been pretty well controlled, and the Justice Committee quoted from the Legal Services Commission report the following figures. In 2005, the cost was &#163;90.6 million. It was revised by the Ministry of Justice on 26 May 2009 to &#163;88.5 million. For 2006, &#163;94.1 million was revised to &#163;90.4 million, and for 2007, &#163;98.2 million&#151;getting rather close to the &#163;100 million&#151;was revised down to &#163;89.9 million. So these figures, showing an unsustainable increase, may be for overall legal aid, but not for this particular set of barristers&#146; fees.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000012"></a>The Merits Committee put into paragraph 10 of its 25th report a previous Justice Committee report, which had said in 2006, I think:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110247000042"></a>&#147;More reform is inevitable. However, the consistent message from evidence received on legal aid reform is that the Commission is proceeding at speed with inconsistent data, a weak evidence-base and a poor understanding of the shape, the cost drivers, other motivating factors, and the structure of its supplier market. In addition, as Lord Carter himself emphasised strongly, this fundamental reform of legal aid provision&#151;for 60 years the pride of the justice system in this country&#151;requires the cooperation of those who deliver the services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000034"></a>The Merits Committee said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110247000043"></a>&#147;In the light of these comments the House may wish to seek further information from the MoJ on the robustness of the assumptions that underpin the current Order&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09110247000035"></a>that is, the one before this Committee&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000047"></a>&#147;both in terms of likely savings and the profession&#146;s willingness to deliver a service under its terms&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110247000036"></a>That is why I have put this Motion to consider before the Committee.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000013"></a>The Justice Committee&#146;s report pointed out, therefore, that there is quite a history to the Legal Services Commission dealing with stakeholders and with  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>controversy over the work commissioned by it. I mention in passing the second Otterburn study. The previous Justice Committee,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000048"></a>&#147;was profoundly troubled by the handling of the Otterburn issue on the part of the LSC&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110247000014"></a>This Justice Committee said that there were obvious flaws in the evidence of the Legal Services Commission that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000049"></a>&#147;should have been sorted out in advance of the proposals&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09110247000037"></a>and that the Legal Services Commission had,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000050"></a>&#147;made a substantial rod for its own back&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000015"></a>The Justice Committee also dealt with the implications of the proposals. Perhaps I may give just one example: a case before Mrs Justice Hogg, with four Lever Arch files of 1,200 pages, 29 hours of pre-trial preparation, four days in court and 66 hours as expended by the parents&#146; advocate. If it had been a private client case, it would have been worth about &#163;9,900. Under the existing legal aid scheme, prior to August of this year, it would have been worth &#163;4,875.25. Under the new legal services scheme, all that work will be worth &#163;1,909. The Justice Committee,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000051"></a>&#147;found the line taken by Lord Bach to be highly unconvincing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110247000038"></a>It also set out in considerable detail at paragraph 47 of its report what had been said by my successor as the President of the Family Division and stated that it agreed with it. It then put into its conclusion at paragraph 51 what Sir Mark Potter recently said, which neatly encapsulates the points:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110247000044"></a>&#147;It is no function of mine as Head of Family Justice, to participate in negotiations between government and the professions as to the terms of their remuneration. However, it emphatically is my concern as Head of Family Justice to bring forcibly to the attention of the government the threat to the efficient working of the system in terms of both efficiency and delay if the LSC proceeds regardless of the warnings of the profession and, in particular if those specialising in children cases abandon or cherry pick publicly funded work. Quite apart from the strain upon family judges and the courts' administration by HMCS, there will be significant further delays in the court process caused by inexperienced advocates undertaking more complex work; longer and less focussed hearings; a higher incidence of litigants in person and a greater likelihood of appeals where cases become derailed because of inadequate representation at first instance&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000039"></a>We are talking of course about members of the public caught up in child and other family cases&#151;some of the most vulnerable people. I do not want to take any more time, so I shall not deal with the effect on the various groups of people, which will be obvious to your Lordships.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000016"></a>There is also the impact on the Bench. Many judges at district, circuit and High Court level are appointed from the family Bar. In future, there will be a lack of family practitioners to go on the Bench, which will have an adverse effect on judicial diversity. Almost half the judges of the High Court Family Division are women; it is the only division in which you have that large number, because they are family practitioners. Will they be there in five or 10 years&#146; time?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000017"></a>On 21 October, the Minister gave his decision and consultation response, although that was after the statutory instrument to which I refer. It made some minor improvements in public law work but none in private law or financial cases. The Family Law Bar Association has regretted the lack of further consultation  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and has very real concerns about the driving away of experienced practitioners. My concerns are about the continued failure of the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission to get reliable evidence and accurate data before making fundamental changes and to engage in a proper collaborative discussion with stakeholders. They need to improve their current poor relations, which will require a fundamental change of attitude on the part of the Legal Services Commission. I ask the Government to do better and give us an assurance that they would genuinely listen and act on constructive criticism. If they do not, there will be a serious adverse effect on the administration of family justice and on some of the most vulnerable people in our society, mainly children. I apologise to your Lordships for taking so long, but this is a very important matter. I beg I move.</p>
<h5><a name="09110247000055"></a>6 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09110247000018"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110247000060"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> My Lords, I am sure that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, does not need to apologise for the detailed way in which she introduced her Motion and gave us a chance to have this debate. We should all be grateful for it because she has raised extremely important points. It will not surprise anyone to know that I am not a shop steward speaking on behalf of the family law Bar because I am not a family law practitioner. My interest in the subject, as the Minister&#146;s advisers will know, is in the work that I did with them on the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Bill, which, thanks to them and Ministers, became fit for legislation and is now part of the law.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000019"></a>The points that I want to raise are ones for which I am indebted to a very eminent and well qualified family law practitioner&#151;namely, Khatun Sapnara, who helped very much in preparing the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Bill and has enormous experience dealing with domestic violence and forced marriage issues. I have skimmed the 106-page impact assessment, the 71-page consultation document and the statistics to support the Government&#146;s analysis, so I think that I understand what I am about to say. However, I shall no doubt be proved wrong if I say something that is wrong.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000020"></a>As I understand it, forced marriage cases are outside the graduated fees scheme, and so are effectively protected. That is excellent. Forced marriages are closely related to cases of abduction and those, too, remain outside the graduated fee scheme. That is also excellent. In the consultation, the Government asked whether forced marriage cases should brought within the scheme. The response from the Family Law Bar Association and the Family Justice Council was that it is far too early, following implementation of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act, to introduce this, coupled with the fact that the Government had committed themselves to proper legal funding of cases of that kind. All of what I have just said is most welcome.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000021"></a>There is a problem that I do not think is dealt with in the detailed analysis that I have skimmed. As a result of the complex nature of forced marriage and the issues it raises, such as shame, honour, underreporting and so on, cases frequently arise in the context of  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>private law proceedings and cases involving domestic violence. Those private law proceedings and cases involving domestic violence fall within the scheme. The problem is that the rates will not attract the experienced practitioner who is able to deal with the matter effectively. An experienced practitioner would be able to understand the interface with public law proceedings and abduction proceedings, where the facts of forced marriage&#151;to put it broadly&#151;may intersect.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000022"></a>I shall give a couple of examples. Suppose a British Asian mother applies for a domestic violence injunction to protect herself and discloses that the father is also assaulting the daughter and planning to take her abroad for a forced marriage or that allegations of that kind are raised in the context of private law contact and residence proceedings. An experienced family law practitioner would be able to elicit the necessary disclosures and instructions in the first place and then go to the High Court seeking protection in the context of abduction proceedings or would know how to invite the court to initiate public law proceedings by directing the involvement of social services. The real problem&#151;which is not addressed in the analysis that I have read, where statistics are incapable of being sufficiently refined to home in on this important problem&#151;is that in all probability only very junior and inexperienced barristers would handle such work under this scheme, which simply does not pay enough for the kind of experienced practitioners who are needed.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000023"></a>Private law cases, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has just illustrated, can be very complex and lengthy, requiring witnesses, interpreters, findings of fact and skilled handling of an often very distressed lay client. That is the problem which I know concerns many in the Family Law Bar Association and the Family Justice Council and comes out of the practical experience of someone such as Khatun Sapnara. If that is the case, it is a serious problem for the small minority of very vulnerable people who need to be properly protected by a skilled and senior branch of the legal profession.</p>

<p><a name="09110247000024"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110247000061"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> My Lords, I am speaking in this afternoon&#146;s debate not because I am a shop steward for the family law Bar, but for two particular reasons. The first is the seriousness of the work. This was brought home to me over 20 years ago, when I had completed what turned out to be my last case in family law. I achieved what I thought was a satisfactory settlement for access to children for my male client, a father of two. Within a very short time, he murdered both children out of revenge against his wife for what had happened in court. If ever a situation could bring home to a lawyer how serious and responsible this kind of work was&#151;for it appeared to be a perfectly ordinary case in a small Welsh town&#151;that was it.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000025"></a>My second reason for being here is that last week I happened to be at a social gathering that involved the retirement of a judge who specialises in family work, including, in particular, public law children&#146;s work. I conversed with a lot of judges&#151;circuit judges, a couple of High Court judges and district judges&#151;and  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their staff at that social gathering, and every single one of them said that the whole process was becoming grindingly more difficult. There were far more litigants in person, which meant that cases were taking longer. The family law Bar appeared to the judges to be demoralised as a result of the very matters that we are debating this afternoon, and the whole picture seemed to those judges to be a very unhappy one.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000026"></a>Of course, I accept that both the matters that I have mentioned are merely anecdotal evidence, but I do not believe that there is much better evidence on these issues than anecdotal evidence. We can debate reports by economists until we are blue in the face; we can argue about the basis for their inquiries; we can quarrel about the methodology of their research; and we can certainly, as we have already done, discuss the meaning of their figures. We can also take some very misleading international comparisons, too, but I urge the Minister not even to enter into those because we are dealing with very different types of systems.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000027"></a>However, essentially, we are dealing with a practical question here, and I applaud the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for raising it here today. The core of that question is where the welfare of children lies in relation to the provision of fees for legal aid lawyers. Are we here to pay lip service to the welfare of children or to do real service to it? The Government&#151;whose motivation is good&#151;repeatedly pay lip service to the welfare of children, but this order will mean that children will suffer. The Minister is shaking his head but he does so, I am afraid, against the overwhelming body of evidence from those&#151;and I say this with great respect to him&#151;who are possibly rather better informed than he is about what happens in family courts every day of the week.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000028"></a>We must bear in mind that we are not talking simply about a few whinging barristers or solicitors who are complaining about the fees; we have heard in this debate from the immediate past president of the Family Division of the High Court, and, remarkably, in connection with this debate, we and the Justice Committee have heard from the current president of the Family Division of the High Court. In my recollection, it is unprecedented for heads of division to enter into a debate of this kind with such energy. I remind the Committee what Sir Mark Potter, the president of the Family Division, said on 2 July this year in his Hershman/Levy Memorial Lecture to the Association of Lawyers for Children. He reported serious delays in cases, partly because of the reduction in CAFCASS and the delay in obtaining reports for courts. He went on to warn Ministers&#151;this was his word&#151;&#147;forcibly&#148; over their plans to reform legal aid funding in children&#146;s cases, and he referred to the cuts as a threat to both efficiency and delay. The use of the word &#147;threat&#148; by the current president of the Family Division is remarkably bold. It would be a remarkably bold statement from any judge but particularly from one&#151;I am sure the noble and learned Baroness will agree with me&#151;who is not naturally given to delving in politics if he can possibly avoid it; he is not a government scientist. He said that if lawyers left this area of work, there would be a rise in the number of people representing themselves and further delays caused by, as he put it,</p>
<ul><a name="09110247000052"></a>&#147;inexperienced advocates undertaking more complex work&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09110247000040"></a>He said hearings would be less focused and appeals more likely, and he attacked the Legal Services Commission over what he called a discouraging lack of realism in its apparent determination to disregard the warnings that he and others were giving.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000029"></a>I do not want to repeat what has already been said so skilfully and forcefully by the noble and learned Baroness. She has drawn your Lordships&#146; attention to the reports of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee and the Justice Committee. She has already drawn attention to the argument&#151;and it will remain an argument because we are not going to solve it here&#151;about the nature of the figures that have been produced. Ultimately, if this order remains in force in its present form, we will have discriminatory legislation. It will discriminate against women litigants&#151;because many of the litigants in this area are women&#151;and it will discriminate, particularly, against children, as I have already said. It will discriminate strongly against women and children from black minority ethnic groups because some of the least skilled litigants and litigants in person in this area are women who do not have the social skills to be able to represent themselves in court because their customs do not give them social skills. As anyone who has ever tried a case with litigants in person will know, there is nothing worse in a court than a frightened litigant in person appearing before a judge.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000030"></a>As the noble and learned Baroness said, it will also discriminate against female barristers because women form the greater proportion of barristers doing this kind of work. They do it far better than most men possibly can because they have an understanding&#151;I hope this is not a sexist expression; if it is, I make no apology for it&#151;of issues that sometimes male lawyers find it difficult to get their heads around. The effectiveness of what the Bar and female advocates have done in this area has amply justified the view that the money has been well spent; compared with many other areas of the law, there have not been galloping increases in legal aid funding.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110247000031"></a>The Baby P case and the greater intervention of local authorities in the welfare of children are not going to result in fewer cases but in far more, as Sir Mark Potter has said. There is nothing in this order that promises that those cases will be dealt with fairly and efficiently; it will be absolutely the contrary.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000001"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110250000071"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, following my noble friend Lord Carlile, a good starting point to understanding why these cases have become more complex is the evidence given by the Association of Lawyers for Children to the judicial committee in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000002"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09110250000072"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> The Justice Committee.</p>

It set out a list of issues; there may be many more, but this is what it assumes. There is a vast area of new jurisprudence and obligations arising out of the European Convention on Human Rights; there is an ever-increasing volume of papers in children&#146;s proceedings arising from the ECHR; there are new forms of documentary  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence and greater judicial expectations; the use of e-mail includes the expectations of clients for contact and explanation; there is an ever-increasing amount of case law, practice directions, and legislative and other initiatives; and there is an increased focus on the care plan in public law proceedings, rather than on the issue as to whether or not to make a care order.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000004"></a>Then there are advances and ongoing research in medical science, especially related to injuries, and in the understanding of child abuse. I had some experience of that in a case in July. I was dealing with the criminal end of it but the whole of the family proceedings were before me. The case had lasted about six days, with a vast amount of documentation, exhibits and medical evidence, with experts disagreeing on either side, and with the judge having to come to a conclusion and counsel on both sides doing their best to cope with difficult medical issues. Then there are diversity issues and a matter to which my noble friend Lord Carlile referred&#151;the problems that many litigants have with English, it being their second language. There are also litigants with learning difficulties and so on. All these problems have added up to cause great difficulty in the family courts.</p>
<h5><a name="09110250000068"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000005"></a>It is ironic that at the moment, when public concern about the protection of children is rising as a result of the Baby P case and other cases, the Government step forward and cut the provision for legal aid in this sensitive area. There are times when one appreciates the huge gap that has opened up between government and the reality of what goes on in the courts. I do not know how many of those behind the Minister today have practised in the courts or have been in the courts and heard cases, but it seems that much of the legislation that comes forward from the Government is not based on proper evidence. The Justice Committee referred in its report to the complete lack of adequate research on this matter&#151;for example, research into the impact of the provisions that are being put forward on the suppliers of legal services.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000006"></a>On other occasions, the Minister has said that the gaps will be filled by in-house advocates, the provision of alternative business initiatives or other things that do not exist at the moment. An order was introduced in July and put into effect in August 2009 in the context of a system of legal services that does not exist. If the Minister goes back to what he has done in the past and relies on this pattern of supply&#151;on the future that he foresees&#151;he will be doing a great disservice to the seriousness of the issue. The family service is for vulnerable children and families and, as the current economic climate gets worse, relationships crumble, marriages break up, children suffer, violence enters the home and the problems that come before the courts get more difficult and complex.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000007"></a>All are agreed that legal aid expenditure must be controlled, but the people who appear in court are not there for the money but because they are dedicated, whether they are barristers, solicitors or advocates. In 2006, the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, wanted to shift legal aid from piece work to block contracts and from paying for time to paying for outcomes. What  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has not been appreciated is that to get to the nirvana sought by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, takes a lot of detailed, complex steps and care. It is that care, investigation and research that the Government have not done.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000008"></a>Our view is that the proposals before us in this order will simply cause future problems. They leave too many vulnerable people without help. Families will run into greater difficulties financially and otherwise, and the state will be torn between removing children and saving money. Ultimately, the lack of properly considered ancillary relief will push broken families into the path of destitution.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000009"></a>The other argument advanced by the Government is that it is all swings and roundabouts. &#147;Yes&#148;, they say, &#147;we are reducing the provision of legal aid by &#163;13.5 million, but we are paying people more for less&#148;. In other words, they are paying more for the less complex cases and taking money away from the more complex to pay for the first group. However, that ignores the basic principle of how the legal profession works, has always worked and, one hopes, will always work&#151;namely, that more experienced practitioners will do the more difficult cases. That is the point made very strongly by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, who is to be heartily congratulated for bringing this matter forward.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000010"></a>You cannot expect experienced practitioners to go into the smallest cases to get more money. In Hong Kong, it was a joke that when you joined the Hong Kong Bar in the criminal field, in the first six months you would find yourself either prosecuting or defending in a murder case. As you made your name and became better known, you would go down the courts and in the end appear in the magistrates&#146; court for huge fees, paid by people with enormous fortunes who were being done for speeding. You could see how the profession in Hong Kong was being dragged down in that way. Structuring a legal aid system in such a way that the more experienced people are tempted to do the less difficult work is crazy.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000011"></a>One hopes that we will hear from the Minister that the Government have something a little better in mind for the future and that they will not pursue the course that they have so inadequately pursued so far.</p>

I have benefited greatly by the debate initiated by the noble and learned Baroness in laying her Motion to take note of the order that came into force as long ago as 4 August. As she pointed out, the order makes changes to the legal aid family barrister fee scheme&#151;the family graduated fee scheme, or FGFS.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000013"></a>The justification that the Government have given for these changes, on the surface at least, sounds reasonable. They have increased the basic rate paid to counsel for public law children cases by approximately 17 per cent and reduced and abolished some of the special issue payments made to barristers, making a large saving for the legal aid budget. At least, I might have thought that they sounded reasonable until I heard

I know that on occasions in the past the Minister has had to defend the indefensible and explain the inexplicable, but I think that that will be a test of all those abilities on his part.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000014"></a>One effect of the order will be to allow the harmonised fee scheme to take effect from next October, putting in place the same remuneration for barristers and solicitors and, we are told, rewarding case complexity. Currently, solicitors are paid on a different remuneration basis, focused around an hourly rate. We know from correspondence with the Law Society that it is broadly supportive of these proposals, which it sees as a first step towards a harmonised advocacy scheme, levelling out the rates payable to barristers and solicitors for the same work.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000015"></a>It is hard to deny the fairness of that, although there is more than one outcome as a result of the changes wrought by this order. It will not surprise the noble Lord&#151;particularly having heard these very telling speeches&#151;that the Bar Council has been somewhat less enthusiastic in its response. The noble Lord may say that it is not possible to please all of the people all of the time, especially when budgets are under strain. However, the Bar Council has raised a number of very salient concerns, which ought to be considered carefully. As the noble and learned Baroness and the noble Lords, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, Lord Carlile and Lord Thomas of Gresford, have now raised some compelling arguments, I can hardly wait to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000016"></a>Of course, we start with the premise of the need to make savings. The noble and learned Baroness stressed that throughout her speech; she acknowledged the importance of making savings, but the figures that she used were fascinating. Can the Minister confirm that the existing payment regime&#151;the FGFS, which came into being in 2001&#151;has resulted in the savings of 5 per cent that it was expected to make, resulting in the Government agreeing to put money back into the scheme in 2005? Can the Minister please tell the Grand Committee in very clear terms what the financial implications of the order are? Does it mean that &#163;2 million per annum is being removed from fees paid to barristers in public law cases?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000017"></a>I note, as has the noble and learned Baroness, that the consultation paper published in June 2008 relied on data which had to be revised in a letter from the MoJ in May this year. It showed that the FGFS had largely succeeded in controlling costs. Can the Minister explain why the Government continued with the cuts proposed in the order, even though the underlying rationale had been shown to be mistaken? There are, of course, quite legitimate reasons to seek to trim government expenditure, but it also useful, particularly for noble Lords, to have them properly justified. The noble and learned Baroness has asked the Government to consider the effect of these cuts in the real world. I found very compelling some of the cases which have been instanced in this, sadly all too short, debate.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000018"></a>Family legal aid is, as I think all noble Lords would agree, a very sensitive area. The service is indispensable for families and crucial in the role that it plays in protecting children from circumstances of sometimes appalling abuse. Sadly, the role of the state in intervening in the care of children has had very high-profile coverage in recent months, and not for the happiest of reasons. Does the Minister accept that the changes to the funding of public law cases to be brought about by the order increase the risk that effective representation may suffer? I am now very concerned that the number of family barristers willing to undertake difficult and complex cases may fall because taking on such cases may simply be uneconomical. I was persuaded that it is not just a case of excess demand or supply; it is a case of looking at what the effect of the order will be in the real world. Can the Minister tell noble Lords what work the Government are now doing with the Bar Council, the Family Law Bar Association and the other interested parties that have been mentioned to ameliorate this concern?</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000019"></a>I was very impressed by the arguments adduced by the noble and learned Baroness in referring to the Merits Committee, on which the noble and learned Baroness sits. Its 25th report quotes the Justice Committee, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rightly said. I quote it now because it is a very worrying message:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110250000064"></a>&#147;The consistent message from evidence received on legal aid reform is that the Commission is proceeding at speed with inconsistent data, a weak evidence-base and a poor understanding of the shape, the cost drivers, other motivating factors, and the structure of its supplier market. In addition, as Lord Carter himself emphasised strongly, this fundamental reform of legal aid provision&#151;for 60 years the pride of the justice system in this country&#151;requires the cooperation of those who deliver the services&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000020"></a>Finally, will the Minister explain how he hopes to implement successful reforms if he does not have the good will of the profession which must put those reforms into practice and live by their results? Of course, there is pressure on all budgets all around government&#151;all departments are, or ought to be, looking for savings where possible&#151;but we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in defence of the order and the changes to funding that it makes, and exactly what his department is doing to work with the legal professions to effect changes in the smoothest manner possible.</p>

We should debate it as a House more often than we do.

It is also about getting the advice that you need at as early a stage as possible, so that your case does not necessarily end up in court. It is about making sure that court is the last resort&#151;this is particularly true in family law&#151;and not the first port of call.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000024"></a>At the risk of incurring the wrath of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, early on in my speech, I draw to the Committee&#146;s attention a recent independent report, hot off the press, on international comparisons of legal aid spend in England and Wales. It is a proper academic report and does not all go one way. While it is not something that I intend to boast about, particularly before this group of noble Lords gathered today, it shows something that is undoubtedly true: that England and Wales has one of the highest per capita legal aid spends in the world. The report confirms that, as a result of higher case volumes and higher average costs per case, legal aid expenditure per head of population in England and Wales is infinitely higher than in other countries, including France, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden&#151;which all have different systems from ours&#151;and Australia and Canada.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000025"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110250000076"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> Perhaps I may ask the Minister a fundamental question about that report, of which I am well aware. Where does he find in it a measurement of the activity in other countries that takes place out of courts through, for example, their social services systems? The report seems not to make any comparison of like with like, just as, by way of analogy, reports with foreign comparisons of terrorism custody periods do not compare like with like. It is a totally misleading picture.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000026"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09110250000077"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> One has to compare common law legal systems, not common law with civil law. They are entirely different. If one, for example, deals with costs in Strasbourg and cost orders, it is always the case that English practitioners&#146; costs are much higher than those in continental countries, but if one compares the costs with Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United States or any common law countries, one sees that it is a totally different picture. One is comparing apples with cement.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000027"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09110250000078"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Of course, and I started this part of my speech by saying that comparisons are very difficult to do. It is undoubtedly true that the cost of courts in this country is much lower than in other countries, but the cost of legal aid in this country is much higher than in other countries. We have an adversarial system, so any comparison with civil legal systems is bound to be particularly difficult. However, you can make better comparisons with other common law countries than you can with civil systems. It would be hard for argue that, for various reasons, some good and some bad, we do not spend much more than other countries per head on legal aid across the field.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000028"></a>We, as a Government, think that that is an excellent thing. We continue to provide a vital link to justice for many people, particularly the most vulnerable in our communities. I remind the Committee that every year legal aid provides around 2.5 million acts of assistance  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to people with their legal problems. With regard to the social welfare element of the budget, which is much too small and has been the poor relation of legal aid for 60 years, we are committed to helping people with the problems that can bedevil their lives. Our commitment to that is evident, with an increase in funding of &#163;80 million for legal services delivered by the not-for-profit sector on civil matters, compared with around &#163;24 million in 2000-01. At a time of recession, it is particularly important that we do not slow down our spend at all in that field, and that is why we have provided more money for debt, housing and employment cases. I particularly mention the housing possession court duty scheme, which helped nearly 34,000 people last year.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000029"></a>Under our reform programme, which has been mentioned, steps are being taken to sustain that commitment but also to prioritise the legal aid budget effectively to ensure that it goes as far as possible in favour of civil help for those who need it most. Surely any Government would have to try to remove duplication or inefficiency and secure value for money. Doing so would mean that as many people as possible would continue to benefit by getting the legal help that they need, and we are committed to ensuring that that happens.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000030"></a>The challenge today and in the future is to help as many people as possible with a large but limited budget. We spend around &#163;2.1 billion on legal aid. Spending on legal aid in the past 20 years has increased from &#163;835 million in today&#146;s prices, which is an average annual real-terms growth of about 5 per cent and one of the fastest growing areas of public expenditure.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000031"></a>Of our budget of &#163;2.1 billion, about &#163;1.2 billion goes on crime&#151;that is far too much; the balance is wrong&#151;and only about &#163;900 million on civil, which includes family, asylum and immigration, and social welfare law. In 1983-84, the total spend on legal aid in real terms was about &#163;572 million, which, interestingly, is just less than what we have spent on family legal aid alone this year.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000032"></a>Last month, my department announced a review to be conducted by Sir Ian Magee into the delivery of legal aid to ensure that the &#163;2.1 billion budget is delivering best value for money, that it provides a healthy and sustainable future for social welfare law and that it effectively integrates the criminal defence service within the criminal justice system. The review, whose importance it is difficult to exaggerate, will assess the delivery and governance arrangements of the legal aid system and make recommendations to explore the separation of the criminal defence service and the Community Legal Service&#151;which has been argued for for a long time by people across the political spectrum&#151;and options for doing so effectively and efficiently, should that be the recommended way forward. It will also provide for effective and transparent financial management of both funds and their administration.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000033"></a>In the 10 years since the Legal Services Commission was established, there have been considerable changes in the type of legal advice services that the public need, and we believe now is the right time seriously to

That is even more important at a time of economic difficulty.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000034"></a>I shall not move into the criminal legal aid debate at the moment, but will go straight to family. We are keen to ensure that we support the provision of help to people with the housing, debt and employment problems that so often trigger not only family breakdowns but the descent into crime. However, the need to secure value for money and to prioritise our resources in everything we do means that we must look at reform on the civil and family side too.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000035"></a>In this debate, there is a danger of confusing two orders. There is the order that has been in force since 3 August and prompted the noble and learned Baroness&#146;s debate. There is also a pending order to do with the new contracts to be signed to come into operation from 1 October 2010. One cannot look at one proposal without looking at the other. The second order is the now-published harmonised family advocacy scheme. The family graduated fees scheme order that came into operation in August is before us this evening.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000036"></a>Spending across all levels of family legal aid has increased fairly dramatically in the past seven years from &#163;399 million in 2001-02 to &#163;582 million in 2007-08, which is an increase in real terms of 24 per cent. The new harmonised schemes&#151;and who could be against harmonised schemes?&#151;will direct more money into public law cases to ensure that children and adults at risk of abuse take the highest priority for legal services. The fee schemes do not represent cuts to the family legal aid budget or to the services received by children and families. They have been designed to be cost-neutral against 2007-08 average case costs and for the first time&#151;not before time&#151;the fees will fairly reward barristers and solicitors with the same fees for the same work. I trust that there is no opposition to that principle.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000037"></a>We have closely involved family lawyers in developing our policy on these changes and, as a result, we made substantive changes to our original proposals to ensure that the new structure would better reflect the variety of cases that advocates deal with and, particularly, their complexity. It has been generally accepted, whether grudgingly or less grudgingly, that the new scheme, which was published last month, does a great deal more service to the complexity argument than the original consultation.</p>

What I am about to say is sensitive. The justification for having an independent Bar and barristers is their special skill in advocacy. Some solicitors are perfectly capable of achieving the same level of skill in advocacy, but the problem I have tried to address is of very skilled barristers dealing with complicated cases for private law work being deterred. Does the Minister agree that the whole justification  


<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>2 Nov 2009 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the side of the profession to which he and I belong is the very special skilled advocacy provided by the senior practitioners at the Bar, with some solicitors being able to do so as well?</p>

<p><a name="09110250000039"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110250000080"></a>Lord Bach:</b> There will always be a place for an independent Bar with highly specialist, skilled barristers. However, I do not agree with the noble Lord in making this distinction between solicitors and barristers. In serious family law work now, in public law and in private law&#151;the most serious, in my view, is always public law&#151;solicitors play a much greater and important role in these difficult and sensitive cases. It is absurd that they should be paid less than barristers for the same work. There is not much between the noble Lord and me, but it is an important principle that should have been brought in many years ago. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, agrees with me on this matter at least. The changes were welcomed by the Association of Lawyers for Children, about which we heard earlier.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000040"></a>We are acutely aware that legal aid lawyers will be feeling the effects of the recession in the same way as everyone else, but the final scheme that we published in October will allow us to achieve a reasonable balance between complexity and value for money which will help sustain access to quality legal services for the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000041"></a>On family matters, we dispute strongly that vulnerable children will not get the representation they need and that people will go unrepresented. The fee scheme proposals do not involve cuts to the services received by children and families. Clients will of course continue to receive legal assistance through the legal aid scheme as they do now. The majority of this work is conducted by solicitors, who will see significantly increased fees. Under the new scheme, we would expect more solicitors to start doing their own advocacy or to increase the amount of advocacy they already do so well. We are confident that the fees we are offering are fair and will ensure that people will be able to receive the legal advice and assistance they need.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000042"></a>The new fee scheme moves directly more money into public law cases to ensure that children and adults at risk of abuse take the highest priority for legal services. The fee schemes do not represent cuts to the family legal budget or to the services received by children and families.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000043"></a>As I say, spending across all levels of family legal aid has increased dramatically. During that same period, the number of funding certificates issued in family proceedings decreased. Of course I accept the argument about complexity; there may be fewer cases but some of them are certainly more complex than the ones that went before. The cost increases were unsustainable within a limited budget and our fee scheme will help to control future increases. Pressure on the legal aid budget is severe and is likely to increase in the current economic climate as more people require advice on housing, debt, welfare benefit and family breakdown. If we do not control family advocacy costs then we will be forced to cut services to clients, either through cutting the scope of the services that are funded or by reducing the financial eligibility for services.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000044"></a>The phase 2 family fees consultation proposals represent the next phase of the reform programme to bring family advocacy costs under better control and offer a fair payment structure to advocates. We aim to contain inflationary costs on family advocacy and maintain legal aid expenditure at 2007-08 levels. This will be done through the introduction of two standard fee schemes and changes to the scope of funding. We spend more than &#163;120 million a year on family advocacy and we will continue to spend this under the new scheme. Our proposed family advocacy scheme is about paying the same fee for the same work. We have not reduced barristers&#146; rates to solicitors&#146; rates but have set an intermediate rate which is fair to all advocates. I repeat: we are making no cuts to services for children and families. Clients will receive legal assistance through the legal aid scheme, as they do now. There are more than 3,000 family legal aid barristers and we are confident that access to their services will not be significantly affected by these necessary changes. We shall see whether there is a successful and lively family Bar in the years to come. My guess is that there clearly will be.</p>

Of course, if the system was falling apart, any Government would have to act, but there is absolutely no evidence that that is so. That there are difficult cases, particularly in the public law field&#151;more difficult now than there have been over the past 50 years&#151;is undoubtedly true, but there is absolutely no reason to believe that the family Bar will disintegrate as a consequence of these reforms.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000047"></a>As to the effect that these reforms will have on BME providers, the Legal Services Commission has discussed the possible impacts of the family legal aid reforms on female and BME barristers with a number of different stakeholders, such as the Equality and Diversity Committee of the Bar Council. As a result of this and the detailed advice and suggestions that we received throughout the consultation, our original proposals have been substantially revisited, primarily to recognise complexity in cases. We were told that what was needed to assist female and BME barristers was to ensure that the scheme allowed for complexity to be properly rewarded. So the final fee scheme has more gradation to reward advocates who take on the more complex cases, who still are most likely to be barristers. We believe that will mitigate any adverse impact on female and BME barristers and is likely to result in a significant increase in the number of barristers who will benefit under the new scheme, rather than lose.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000048"></a>I was asked by the noble Lords, Lord Carlile and Lord Thomas, about discrimination against women and children and litigants with English as a second language. We do not think that our schemes lead to discrimination against those classes of persons. If clients cannot give instructions well, for example, there will be a bolt-on to the fee to be paid to the advocate.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000049"></a>As to the point about discrimination and that BME women at the Bar are reliant on legal aid, I am not sure whether the Government and the LSC should be the ones held responsible for the fact that a large section of BME and female barristers do legal aid work. It is to some extent a responsibility of the Bar itself and of clerks in chambers, who have traditionally pushed legal aid work in that direction. I would like to see figures for how much private family work is given to BME female barristers, to see whether it explains the issue to some extent.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, has a particular interest in the issue of forced marriages. He is quite right: forced marriage legislation is outside the scheme. The rates for domestic violence are based on historical costs. However, there are higher fees for such cases in the High Court. There is a bolt-on payment if the client has difficulty giving instructions and another where expert evidence is required. Finding-of-fact hearings, which are an important part of family proceedings, are to be paid as final hearings.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000051"></a>The Government very much value the commitment of all lawyers who work in the interests of the most vulnerable members of society involved in family legal proceedings. That work, which is paid for from the public purse, is never likely to be as financially rewarding as work for private clients, but it is a vital public service. We are using the limited money and best resources that we have to meet pressures created by the recession. It is not an easy matter at the moment to try to balance the legal aid budget. Criminal legal aid is demand-led. We are obliged, under the ECHR, to spend money on representing defendants who are charged with serious cases. That is as it should be.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000052"></a>What is not right is that extra money spent on criminal legal aid should come out of a civil legal aid budget. That is behind our policy all the way. We want to make sure that criminal legal aid does not eat up the civil legal aid budget. That is what has been happening over many years. That is why we asked Sir Ian Magee to look very carefully at whether it is necessary to have two quite separate funds to make sure that if the criminal legal aid budget is much more than is anticipated for various reasons, the balance should be paid from the criminal justice system, rather than the civil legal aid system. I hope that is a philosophy that might find some support among noble Lords present tonight.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000053"></a>As far as the orders and the changes we have made to them are concerned, I can do no better than to quote again from the Association of Lawyers for Children, a much respected organisation. It makes these points:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110250000065"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s original proposals were heavily criticised by family lawyers and judges who warned that they would lead to parents and children in complex cases being badly represented, or not even being represented at all ... But the scheme has been radically restructured and revised following input from the leading practitioner groups and an intervention by the President of the Family Division&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000063"></a>The Government&#146;s announcement was,</p>
<ul><a name="09110250000067"></a>&#147;broadly welcomed by the Association of Lawyers for Children, one of the practitioner groups involved in improving the scheme&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09110250000054"></a>The co-chair of the ALC commented:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09110250000066"></a>&#147;The priority for family legal aid must be child protection. These are complex, demanding cases, involving the highest of stakes and requiring a high level of expertise to conduct properly. We welcome the Government&#146;s recognition of that priority and reality, together with the significant improvements to the scheme that have now been made. While we still have concerns about some elements of it, the scheme now proposed is immeasurably better, fairer and more practice-reflective than that originally devised. That shows the benefits of working within the family justice system&#148;.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000055"></a>There has undoubtedly been a lot of collaborative working within the family justice system since the consultation period ended and that work has borne considerable fruits. The result, although not entirely popular among some commentators and groups, is now generally accepted as being much better than the papers on which the matter was consulted. We now have the possibility of a system for family legal aid fees, starting on 1 October next year, which will be fairer&#151;it will be fair to solicitors as well as to barristers&#151;and takes account of the fact that some family law cases are much more complicated than others. One example of the way in which we have tried to ensure that those who do the most difficult cases get the bigger rewards is that we have agreed to an extra payment depending on the court in which the family hearing is to take place.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000056"></a>I understand how strongly the noble and learned Baroness feels about this issue and about the order that came into force in August. I hope she agrees that the new order, which it is hoped will come into force in due course and which sets the fees and conditions to run from 1 October 2010, is an improvement and that it is being introduced because of the considerable help and assistance that we have had from the FLBA and other groups of solicitors.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000057"></a>I think that everyone who has taken part in this debate has a passion for legal aid and believes that it has a vital part to play in our legal system. The Government have no less a passion for it and we hope to improve it in the years to come.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000058"></a><b><a name="91102-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09110250000083"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> My Lords, first, I thank noble Lords for taking the trouble to attend today and for their support. It is important to have an airing of this very important subject. I should like to make certain that it is understood that I accept the need to make savings and to secure value for money. I have absolutely no objection to the harmonisation of fees for the Bar and solicitors for doing the same job, but not for doing different jobs&#151;that is an important distinction.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000059"></a>I accept, as I think I said, that there were improvements in public law payments. These will not take effect until October next year, so we have to go through with the current statutory instrument until then. However, there are not going to be improvements in the private law sector, either in children cases, domestic violence or ancillary relief&#151;that is to say, financial payments. These cases can be as complex, difficult and time consuming as public law cases and, if not well done, some private law cases can become public law cases. There is a long way to go still. I would like the Minister&#151;and particularly those behind him&#151;to reflect on what has been said by noble Lords during the debate.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000060"></a>What the Minister has said has not taken us all the way. I particularly have in mind that the warning of the president, Sir Mark Potter, applies now as much as it did before, save in so far as there are some, but not sufficient, improvements to public law. His warning and the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is that we need to keep in mind what the family Bar is saying. The Government underappreciate the value of the family Bar&#151;particularly where its ability and experience enables it to obtain settlements which allow people to go away relatively satisfied&#151;when compared to an inexperienced Bar which cannot understand how to settle, and where cases drag on and cost more legal aid money. The longer the case takes, the more it costs, whereas a senior man or woman can get the case over, sometimes on the first day. There is a balance between the costs of cases running on and the extra payment to the more experienced Bar.</p>

<p><a name="09110250000061"></a>I am glad there is to be a review; I hope it will involve all stakeholders. The philosophy of separate budgets is excellent; it will be a real step forward for criminal legal aid not to take from the rest of the budget.</p>

<a name="91102-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09110250000062"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, who wanted to be here but is teaching today, told me in relation to BME women lawyers&#151;barristers and solicitors&#151;that a family lawyer is thought to be a suitable profession for Muslim women. That may be one reason why there are more of them at the family Bar than elsewhere. It is an interesting point that the noble Baroness would have made if she had been here.</p>

<a name="0911022000003"></a><b><a name="91102-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0911022000023"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration (Phil Woolas) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0911022000004"></a>Together with Baroness Delyth Morgan, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families, I have today issued statutory guidance to the UK Border Agency under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0911022000005"></a>Section 55 comes into force today. It places a duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for ensuring that immigration, asylum, nationality and Customs functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. A similar duty is placed on the director  of border revenue in respect of the director's functions. Section 55(3) and (5) requires any person exercising any of these functions to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0911022000006"></a>Section 55 is intended to have the same effect as Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, which places a similar duty on a range of key public bodies. This guidance is an important step in the process of bringing the UK Border Agency within the family of agencies that, together, have statutory responsibilities to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when carrying out their duties. The guidance is supported by a programme of reform to improve the way in which children are treated in the immigration system, led by the agency's senior management, and which includes an extensive training programme for UK Border Agency staff. The UK Border Agency will be held to account by its new, independent chief inspector, who will inspect and challenge us on our progress.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0911022000010"></a>I am now able to confirm that the next phase of the programme has been implemented today&#151;the family courts' information pilot. This pilot will test the provision of written judgments in more cases than now, and place anonymised judgments and written reasons in the public domain via the British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) website. The pilot will run from today in the magistrates' courts in Leeds, and the magistrates' court and county court in Cardiff, and will run from the beginning of January at the magistrates' court and county court in Wolverhampton.</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0911022000011"></a>The provision of the judgments and written reasons is being piloted in order that we can assess the benefits to parties to proceedings and the wider public, as well as the resource impacts on court service staff and the judiciary. The pilot is expected to run for 12 months, and evidence from the pilot will be evaluated to inform a decision on whether the arrangements should be implemented nationally.</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0911022000012"></a>The following types of cases fall within the scope of the pilot:</p>

<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0911022000013"></a>cases where an interim care/supervision order or a final order has been made at a hearing in either:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0911022000015"></a>cases that fall under at least one of the following categories:</p>
either parent is given leave permanently to remove a child from the UK;the final order prohibits direct contact between a child and either or both parents; a final order is made in a Children Act public law case, including where contact continues;the final order has depended on contested issues of religion, culture or ethnicity;the court has had to decide between medical or other expert witnesses where there were significant differences of opinion;the court has had to decide significant human rights issues; and the interim care/supervision order was contested.
<a name="91102-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0911022000016"></a>There will be other types of case in which publication of the judgment will be encouraged. The type of cases include:</p>
contested cases where the facts, outcomes or solutions of the case would, in the discretion of the judge, be worthy of reporting publicly. So, for example, contested residence or disputed contact issues where the outcome is unusual (eg, father has residence, et cetera);contested adoption applications, applications to make and revoke placement orders; cases involving dispensation with consent and contact; andemergency protection orders.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_210"></a><a name="09110223000240"></a>Where a patient has difficulty in taking fluids orally, the healthcare team are expected to assess their condition and requirements for hydration. Various forms of artificial nutrition and hydration may help prolong and improve the quality of a patient's life, but potential benefits may be accompanied by problems and complications. Decisions in these difficult cases should be taken in accordance with professional guidance. If artificial hydration might prolong a patient's life, and the patient has the capacity to make decisions about their care, the clinician is expected to discuss with the patient the benefits, disadvantages and risks so that they can make an informed decision about their future treatment. If artificial hydration might prolong the patient's life and the patient lacks capacity, those close to the patient should be fully involved in making a decision which serves the patient's best interests.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_211"></a><a name="09110223000242"></a>The configuration of stroke services will depend on a number of factors, for example the geography of the area and the age profile of the local population. Commissioners will therefore need to decide which configuration of services best meet the needs of their locality. This could range from fully specified free-standing rural hospitals, through networked groups of units across regions to hub and spoke arrangements in dense urban areas. New technologies, such as telemedicine, can afford solutions to providing services in rural areas.</p>

Therefore, for reasons of consistency of legislation, and after consultation with the Home Office, the period of validity for warrants issued under Regulation 7(4) of the Marketing of Fresh Horticultural Produce Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/1361) was fixed at three months.

The RPA logotype is included because it is the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate of the RPA which enforces the marketing standards in England. The enforcement labels assist in quickly identifying the breach identified to all concerned. In the case of the regraded label, they indicate to the holder of the produce that the labels on the produce containing the class information required by the marketing standards need to be corrected. Once this has been done, the regraded enforcement labels can be removed.</p>

Since that time there has been no renegotiation of these contracts, and no changes to their terms and conditions. There have, however, been resets of the contracts. Reset is a normal, repeatable process for contracts with a long lifetime to ensure that their ongoing delivery reflects progress to date, current priorities, and deployment plans for the future, and that they continue to support the evolving needs of the National Health Service. However, reset allows for the option of agreeing enhancements to existing services or functionality that does not effect a change in contract scope or risk allocation. The contracts contain provision for the termination of the whole contract or a part of the services provided by a supplier.</p>

The contracts will enable the streamlined procurement of IT systems and services from suppliers who have demonstrated experience in the health sector and can be used to support both NPfIT-related work and wider IT-related projects. The procurement of the framework contracts was initiated with the publication of an <I>OJEU</I> notice in March 2007.</p>

<a name="91102w0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_216"></a><a name="09110223000258"></a>These contracts are not intended to replace the contracts already let for the National Programme for IT.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_217"></a><a name="09110223000259"></a>The framework arrangements provide for NHS bodies with specific requirements to conduct a further competitions procedure, engaging suppliers who have been awarded a framework contract in the appropriate service category or categories. Should changes to requirements be necessary in due course there may be an opportunity to amend the defined terms and conditions of supply, depending on the scope and type of these changes.</p>

These two cases alone accounted for an increase in legal expenditure of &#163;2 million. Scale fees for counsel increased in April 2006, the first increase in a number of years, and this also contributed to overall increase in 2006-07.</p>

The report raises serious concerns about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, which we share. The report is a precursor to the Commission's recommendation to EU member states on whether Sri Lanka should continue to benefit from the GSP+ trade preference scheme. We are clear that to do so Sri Lanka must respect its international human rights obligations under GSP+. We continue to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to engage with the Commission and to take immediate action to address the issues outlined in its report.</p>

It will be some years before all relevant heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are so fitted, and although fitment is expected to reduce side/rear HGV impact accidents involving poor conspicuity, there are many other contributory causes which it cannot address. These include excess speed, drink-driving, ice, mechanical failure, driving while tired, driver distraction etc.</p>
