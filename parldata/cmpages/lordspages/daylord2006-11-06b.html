However, we are up against an enemy that hides among civilians, that
uses women and children as human shields, and that deploys suicide

Drayson:</b> My Lords, as I have said, we do not
formally track Taliban casualty figures; it would not be practical for
us to do so. However, ISAF has released details of fatalities, where
they have been known to occur in certain firefights, to aid proper
understanding of the context in which those fights have taken place and
in recognition of the fact that the Taliban commanders have developed
an increasingly sophisticated information campaign to undermine the
Government and the activities of ISAF. Obviously we have to counter
that.</p><p><a name="0611064000020"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0611064000675"></a>Baroness

Drayson:</b> No, my Lords. I am not being evasive; I
am describing the situation. It is not practical for our forces to go
into the situation that the noble Lord describes to count bodies. The
nature of the operation does not allow that. It would put our forces
under increased risk. We do not do it. However, my Answer was given on
the basis that, where it is known, ISAF has described
it.</p>

Dubs:</b> My Lords, to go back to the point made by
my noble friend about cluster munitions, does he agree that when there
were arguments about anti-personnel landmines exactly the same defence
was put forward as he is putting forward about the use of cluster
munitions? Is there not a point when the right of civilians not to be
killed years after a conflict is more important than the slight
military justification for having these
weapons?</p><p><a name="0611064000027"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="0611064000682"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend for making the comparison between cluster munitions and
landmines, because he is correct. When a cluster munition does not
operate correctly, in effect it becomes a landmine. Therefore, the
analogy is fair. However, it is important to recognise that this is not
a small military issue. There are situations where the safety of our
Armed Forces depends on commanders being able to deploy this weapon in
those circumstances where it is the only weapon that meets the need. We
should not remove that option from our forces, but we should ensure
that cluster munitions
work.</p><p><a name="0611064000028"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0611064000683"></a>Lord

programme has improved the quality and availability of hospital food.
Patient environment action team scores show that hospital food has
continued to improve since 2001. We will continue monitoring via PEAT
inspections, the annual health check and patient surveys. The
continuing use of protected meal times enables patients to concentrate
on eating and staff to give the help that they need. Eighty-three per

reply. I thank him particularly for making reference to the patient
environment action teams. They were given a target of establishing ward
housekeepers in 50 per cent of NHS hospitals by 2004, which was met.
Given that success, why have the Government stopped at 50 per cent and
when do they expect to introduce ward housekeepers in the remaining 50
per cent of hospitals to help people to
eat?</p><p><a name="0611064000039"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="0611064000694"></a>Lord

came out of the better hospital food programme, as I think the noble
Baroness knows. That programme has now been moved into the mainstream,
with the money delegated locally. It is down to people at the local
level to make the best use of the experience gained from the scheme and
to put ward housekeepers in place when they think it is

which looked at this matter during the five-year period in which it was
in existence, found consistency between in-house and contracted-out
catering, as did the PEAT scores. The position is the same irrespective
of the
contractor.</p><p><a name="0611064000042"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="0611064000697"></a>Baroness
Oppenheim-Barnes:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
accept that, whether they are called housekeepers or nurses&#146;
aides, it is very important for someone to see whether patients have
stopped eating all together? Very often, nurses are too busy to take
this in. Trays are taken away and no record is kept. A nursing aide is
needed rather than a
housekeeper.</p><p><a name="0611064000043"></a><b><a name="61106-0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="0611064000698"></a>Lord

peaceful environment during meal times.</p>

Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, there is no
question of a transfer to other government departments, because the
money released will be used to finance more schemes for small
businesses. It is quite within the capacity and baseline funding
allocations of those government departments to fund schemes from now
on. I have a provisional breakdown of the numbers involved per
government department, which I am happy to place in the Library and
send to the noble Baroness. Overall we think that there are about 239
posts, but they are
provisional.</p><p><a name="0611064000063"></a>It is worth making
the point that there has been a huge expansion in the resource for this

million in 2006-07. The Government are right behind the

off incapacity benefit into work, it is essential that employers ensure
that posts are offered. As part of taking that work forward, we shall
keep a close watch on what is happening within small employers. But I
have no doubt that in the context of welfare reform and the new
provisions in disability discrimination legislation that came in last
year&#151;in terms of public authorities, they are due to come in in
a few weeks&#146; time&#151;there will be greater provision for
these programmes in

that these amendments make the clause simpler and more comprehensible
to the layman. In that respect, at least, I hope that it achieves what
the noble and gallant Lord and others have been seeking. The amendments
do not, however, alter the fact that we have made this offence much
narrower than in the current service discipline Acts. It may be best if

have not altered what comes within the definition of &#147;active
service&#148; but, I repeat, this is much narrower than in the
current Acts. On the meaning of active service, I make it clear that it
covers peacekeeping operations. Where there is armed opposition, it
would be covered under subsection (3)(a) &#147;operations against an
enemy&#148;. Subsection (3)(b) would cover peacekeeping where there
is no enemy. <p><a name="0611064000100"></a>Secondly, we have
removed subsection (5). The outcome is that there are two ways to
commit the offence of desertion: to go absent without leave with the

leave to avoid a period of active service, for which the maximum
penalty is life.</p>

right to extend the jurisdiction of the court martial court to
encompass any criminal offence. Whereas today, a serviceman who commits
murder in the United Kingdom can be tried only by a Crown Court, with
all the procedural safeguards that that involves, in future,
someone&#151;it is not clear who, but presumably the new director of
service prosecutions&#151;will be able to say, &#147;Well, although
this act has been committed in a part of London&#151;you are alleged
to have murdered somebody in London&#151;nevertheless, you are a
serviceman, you work for the services, or you are the child of a
serviceman and are therefore subject to service law&#148;. Someone
can decide that the ordinary Crown Court is not the requisite place to
be tried and may order, under the provisions introduced by the Bill for
the first time in history&#151;certainly since the Army Act
1955&#151;that the person can be tried by court
martial.</p><p><a name="0611064000111"></a>What is the reason for
that? I suspect that it is a way of upping the profile of the new court
martial court. What about the impact on the defendant, who has all
sorts of procedural safeguards in the Crown Court that do not exist in
the military court? For example, in the military court he may be tried
and convicted of murder by a majority of 3:2 as opposed to the
unanimous verdict of a jury, or at the very most a verdict with a
majority of 10:2 in the Crown Court.
</p><p><a name="0611064000112"></a>There are other safeguards, but
I shall not weary your Lordships by listing them all. The
Government&#146;s response on Report was that it was anomalous that
there is an exception in relation to murder, manslaughter, rape and
treason because there are other offences punishable by life
imprisonment, such as serious sexual offences, which are not exempted.
So why should you have one and why have the other? The answer is not to
give the court martial jurisdiction over murder, et cetera, committed
in the United Kingdom. It is to say that any serious offence that
carries life imprisonment should not be tried by a court martial in
this country. I have conceded that if murders or other serious offences
are committed abroad, it may be appropriate, but only as a second best,
for the court martial to deal with those cases.</p><p><a name="0611064000113"></a>I argued in the case of Martin&#151;a
boy of 17 whose father was a serving soldier&#151;which went before
the Judicial Committee of your Lordships House, that it is wrong, even
when an offence is committed abroad, for a civilian to be tried by way
of court martial in front of a row of officers. We did not succeed in
that case in the House of Lords in 1997 because their Lordships held
that you could not call it an abuse of process when Parliament had many
years ago decided that it could be done. But the Human Rights Act was
not in force at that time. The matter went to the European Court, and
it has taken 10 years&#151;until last week&#151;for that court to
pronounce. It has decided unanimously that that should not have
happened, and that only in the most exceptional circumstances should a
civilian be tried by way of court martial for serious offences, even if
they are committed abroad.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_601"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 601</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611064000114"></a>The European Court has expressed its strong
view on this in relation to civilians, but the amendment relates to
courts martial having jurisdiction over offences committed in the
United Kingdom. I should be interested to know how many judge advocates
have tried a murder case. I would not have thought there had been more
than three or four such cases in the past 10 years. I can think of only
one successful prosecution of a murder case&#151;possibly two if I
include Northern Ireland. There is little experience&#151;perhaps
that is the best way to put it&#151;among judge advocates. As far as
I know, they do not carry rape tickets or murder tickets, as Crown
Court judges have to do before they can try such cases. If they do have
such tickets, no doubt the Minister will inform us. There is a lack of
experience in trying what are the most complicated cases. Murder cases
introduce concepts of provocation, self-defence, manslaughter and so
on, as alternatives, which are not easy to resolve.</p><p><a name="0611064000115"></a>The Minister and the Government have
rightly listened to the contributions of the military people who have
commented on the Bill, but they have not listened to the contributions
of people experienced in that legal system. In many ways, they have not
adopted the recommendations of the Judge Advocate General, Judge
Blackett. He was a serving naval officer who retired to become the
Judge Advocate General and he was appointed circuit judge. He made
recommendations which would have improved the procedural safeguards at
courts martial. I have advanced many of those in amendments which have
been rejected by the Government. I have already declared to your
Lordships my own interest in this area of the criminal law, but I
venture to say that I have appeared in more military murder cases than
anyone else I can think of at the moment. Why do the Government not
listen to lawyers? Presumably lawyers do not matter. Often that is the
view expressed, if not openly, certainly implicitly in your Lordships'
House.</p><p><a name="0611064000116"></a>At the end of the day, we
are concerned with fair trials. The European Court has said that one
does not get a fair trial in front of a row of military officers if one
is a civilian. Yet the Government are missingan opportunity
with this Bill to reform radicallythe military justice system
to bring it into the21st century. They have not gone far
enough. That is their problem. The forces of tradition and the forces
of the services have been too much. I hope I have indicated to your
Lordships the importance that I attach to this amendment. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0611064000117"></a><b><a name="61106-0002.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="0611064000750"></a>Baroness

Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, the military in
Scotland will be subject to the Bill. It will be open to the Director
of Service Prosecutions to determine that an offence of murder
committed in Scotland by a serviceman or a civilian subject to service
law can be tried by a court martial.</p><p><a name="0611064000121"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="0611064000754"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, in our earlier debates, the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, sought to prevent this Bill
extending the jurisdiction of the military criminal justice system in
relation to most serious offences committed in the United Kingdom. He
argued for retaining the current legislative position and proposed an
amendment that followed almost exactly the wording of Section 70(4) of
the Army Act. On Report, I argued that such an approach would retain a
significant anomaly that even now produces undesirable effects in
relation to a small number of the most serious criminal conduct
offences.</p><p><a name="0611064000122"></a>I believe that the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, accepted the argument that the
current system was anomalous, but he now seeks to address the anomalous
position not by removing it, but simply by expanding its undesirable
effects. Amendment No. 4 is a retrograde step. As I made clear when we
debated this on Report, it is anomalous that the services can deal with
many very serious offences committed in the UK carrying sentences of up
to life imprisonment but not others. The Bill proposes to remove that
anomaly to create a comprehensive system of service law. Why is that so
important?</p><p><a name="0611064000123"></a>First, we must keep
at the front of our minds what our forces are required to do and where
they are required to do it. We frequently, perhaps increasingly
frequently, deploy them overseas. Sometimes we deploy them to places
where there is a perfectly acceptable legal system; sometimes we deploy
them to places where there is no legal system at all. Sometimes we send
them on operations that require them to work in conditions of physical
hardship and, often, great danger. However, we expect them to behave
impeccably at all times and in every circumstance, not only when they
are called upon to apply lethal force.</p><p><a name="0611064000124"></a>Secondly, the current exclusion in the
service discipline Acts prevents the services dealing with cases even
when they are best placed to do so. For example, where a death occurs
in military training in the UK, are not the services best placed to
investigate and judge the degree of negligence involved, the relevance
of the training given and other elements of the service context? That
must be the relevant consideration for which court deals with an
offence, not, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, suggested, the fact that
a serviceman sent to prison for life will serve that sentence with
ordinary criminals who were tried by the Crown Court.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_603"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 603</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611064000125"></a>Thirdly, the present exclusion can prevent
the joint trial of matters which should be charged together. This point
operates in two ways: first, where an incident may be dealt with by a
combination of both criminal and disciplinary offences; and secondly,
where a series of offences has been committed in the UK and overseas.
If I may say so, the noble Lord fails to see that serious incidents may
give rise to disciplinary and criminal offences. An example might be
charging manslaughter along with a disciplinary charge such as
disobedience of a lawful command, negligent performance of duty,
dangerous flying or hazarding a ship. Only a service court can deal
with them together. Should dealing with them together not be possible
in relation to an incident which occurred in the service context in the
UK? It is not difficult to think of other examples of offences based on
those additional criminal offences that the noble Lord wishes to
add&#151;for example, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger
life, or grievous bodily
harm.</p><p><a name="0611064000126"></a>Finally, the noble Lord,
Lord Thomas of Gresford, conceded that there was good reason for a
military system to deal with offences that occurred overseas. But,
given that our personnel move so frequently between states, it is quite
easy to see circumstances where someone may have committed a series of
serious offences in different countries, including the UK. These are
not far-fetched possibilities; they reflect the practical issues that
flow directly from the way our services operate.</p><h5><a name="0611064000195"></a>3.30
pm</h5><p><a name="0611064000127"></a>I recently wrote to the noble
Lord, Lord Thomas, and provided details of two recent cases which
illustrate the principle. The first concerned a soldier alleged to have
committed offences of violence against service personnel in the United
Kingdom and in Canada, who subsequently faced a charge of attempted
murder in the UK which was dealt with in the UK civilian system. The
second was a former soldier alleged to have raped the same female in
the UK and Germany. Each demonstrated the current limitations of the
civilian courts, and by contrastthe flexibility of the service
courts, to deal withsuch cases. The amendment would extend the
circumstances in which such limitations would impact upon the
administration of justice.</p><p><a name="0611064000128"></a>I
have already told the House that we do not propose that, under the
Bill, murder, rape or treason alleged to have been committed by a
serviceman in the United Kingdom will normally be investigated and
tried within the service system.</p><p><a name="0611064000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, in our last
debate asked who would decide whether a case would be dealt with in the
service or civilian jurisdiction. The answer to that is clear. Our aim
is that in relation to all serious offences, as is the case now, a
decision should be made in accordance with Home Office protocols on
which jurisdiction is the more appropriate. The decision should be made
under those protocols by the civilian authorities, whether the police
or the Crown Prosecution Service, on the basis of the principles set
out in the protocols. Broadly speaking, if the case has any significant




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_604"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 604</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>civilian context&#151;for example, a civilian victim&#151;the
civilian jurisdiction should prevail. This is a common-sense approach
which the amendment would
deny.</p><p><a name="0611064000130"></a>Perhaps the greatest
practical difficulty which the current exclusion has caused is in
relation not even to trial, but to investigations and the use of
service police powers. The present legislation and the Bill provide for
the investigation, arrest, custody, search or charge by the service
police for offences within the service jurisdiction. The current
anomaly therefore has the following effect: if a soldier is abroad but
is suspected of murder, manslaughter or rape in the United Kingdom, it
is at least doubtful whether the service police can undertake searches
abroad for evidence of the offence, arrest the suspect or hold the
suspect in custody even at the request of UK civilian police. That is
unsatisfactory. That is why we propose to remove the provision and why
we cannot accept this amendment, which would make the situation much
worse and tie the hands of the service police in relation to a large
number of other offences.</p><p><a name="0611064000131"></a>The
noble Lord has cited a number of examples where the court martial will
be different from the Crown Court, and concluded that as a result the
court martial will be deficient. I cannot accept any such suggestion. I
do not accept that a military system, which is the equivalent of the
civilian system, must be the same as that civilian system in every
respect. Our aim is to create a service system as good as the civilian
system and appropriate for the services. It must be capable of
operating in a service context and have due regard to it. That context
can be important in all circumstances of military life, not just on
operations. That is because, as I have explained, it is essential for
members of the Armed Forces, whether at home or abroad, to have the
highest standards of readiness and discipline at all times. It is also
important for the service context to be given due weight in relation to
any offence, whether or not it occurs on
operations.</p><p><a name="0611064000132"></a>As I have said in
earlier debates, the military justice system is well able to deal with
the most serious of cases and from time to time sees the participation
of High Court judges and senior civilian counsel. The most serious and
complex cases can be dealt with, and the system in turn commands the
confidence of the public and the Armed Forces. I see no reason why an
ECHR-compliant court such as the court martial should not be able to
exercise these powers in the United Kingdom when it may do so
abroad.</p><p><a name="0611064000133"></a>As I have set out, it is
not hard to envisage circumstances where the interests of justice might
be best served, and victims&#146; rights best protected, by trying
charges together. The interests of justice would not be best served by
this amendment. For the reasons I have given, I ask the noble Lord to
withdraw it.</p><p><a name="0611064000134"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="0611064000755"></a>Lord

am concerned about the current situation in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="0611064000135"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="0611064000756"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, was not the deficiency
identified in our court-martial system prior to changes that we have
already made to
it?</p><p><a name="0611064000136"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="0611064000757"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, certainly there
were two grounds upon which the European Court held. The first was in
relation to the complaint that a 17 year-old civilian boy had been
tried before a court martial&#151;that that was highly undesirable
and did not result in a fair trial. Secondly, since it preceded the
case referred to, the Court held that it was also procedurally wrong.
The advances that have been made in court martials, in trying to bring
them up to date, have been made as a result of defence applications to
the European Court&#151;decisions of the European Court which the
Government have been forced to follow.</p><p><a name="0611064000137"></a>The Minister says that our aim is to
achieve a military system of justice equivalent to the civilian system.
It could have been achieved in this Bill if the Government had listened
to the advice of the Judge Advocate General in important respects and
accepted some of the amendments.</p><p><a name="0611064000138"></a>The Minister says that investigations by
the service police abroad would be at least doubtful. As your Lordships
are well aware, service police do not have the highest track record in
the investigation of crime. In numerous cases of which your Lordships
are aware, the service police have fallen down and acquittals have
followed.</p><p><a name="0611064000139"></a>The system was second
best. It could have been made equivalent to the Crown Court system but
that opportunity has been missed. In this matter, the extension of
jurisdiction over offences committed in this country to the court
martial and the removal of cases from the Crown Court clearly impact on
an individual defendant&#146;s rights&#151;his right to be tried by
his peers instead of appearing in front of a panel of
officers.</p><p><a name="0611064000140"></a>The combination of
disciplinary charges and serious offences put forward by the Minister
presents no argument. He himself has said that there were disciplinary
offences in one case charged in Canada, but the serious offence was
dealt with by the civil court in this country. As for somebody raping a
lady abroad and then raping the same lady in this country, we all know
that even though he might not be tried for the rape abroad, all the
evidence in relation to it would be admissible on a trial in this
country on a basis of similar facts, a similar system or
whatever&#151;certainly under some of the legislation passed by this
Government in the past three years.</p><p><a name="0611064000141"></a>The reasons for extending jurisdiction
have simply not been made and I cannot accept the Minister&#146;s
explanations. However, I pay tribute to him for the way that he has
conducted this Bill&#151;he has done a tremendous job in keeping us
informed as things go along. There is no personal criticism involved,
but I

wording of the amendment echoes the decision of the European Court that
was delivered last week. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that Sir
Nicolas Bratza 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was the number two in that court, sitting next to the president. He is a
highly distinguished jurist from this country who used to represent the
Government in many cases.<p><a name="0611064000146"></a>I
have indicated the circumstances of the case. Paragraph 43 of the
decision of the court states that the court,</p><ul><a name="0611064000184"></a>&#147;recalls, by way of preliminary
remark, that there is nothing in the provisions of Article 6 to exclude
the determination by service tribunals of criminal charges against
service personnel. The question to be answered in each case is whether
the individual&#146;s doubts about the independence and impartiality
of a particular court-martial can be considered to be objectively
justified and, in particular, whether there were sufficient guarantees
to exclude any such legitimate
doubts&#148;.</ul><a name="0611064000172"></a>That is the
position with regard to service personnel. The court said that it
is,<ul><a name="0611064000187"></a>&#147;a different
matter where the national legislation empowers a military court to try
civilians on criminal charges ... While it cannot be contended
that the Convention absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military
courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of
such jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny,
since only in very exceptional circumstances could the determination of
criminal charges against civilians in such courts be held to be
compatible with Article 6 ... The power of military criminal justice
should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons
justifying such a situation, and, if so, only on a clear and
foreseeable legal
basis&#148;.</ul><a name="0611064000173"></a>In the
particular case, it was not finally decided whether there were
compelling reasons, but the issue concerned whether a number of
witnesses would have to be flown from Germany to this country. The fact
that, when the trial was held in Germany, witnesses not simply from the
UK but from all over the world were flown in to give evidence is
perhaps to be noted.<p><a name="0611064000147"></a>The final
conclusion was that the 17 year-old boy was justified. In its decision,
the court says that it,</p><ul><a name="0611064000188"></a>&#147;considers ... concerns
about the independence and impartiality of his tribunal to be
objectively justified. Accordingly it finds that there has been a
violation of Article 6 §1 of the
Convention&#148;.</ul><a name="0611064000174"></a>As your
Lordships know, Article 6.1 deals with the need for a fair trial. I
submit to your Lordships that there should be developed, along with the
service civilian court, a civilian jurisdiction for juveniles in which
the case is tried not by officers, but by a judge advocate, along with
suitably qualified and experienced people who have had the same
training for dealing with juveniles as magistrates have had. That is
how juveniles should be dealt with.
<p><a name="0611064000148"></a>We were told on Report that there are
20,000 juveniles with service people overseas. So an awful lot of
youngsters are involved. If they commit more serious offences such as
murder and manslaughter&#151;the very rare cases where one sees a
juvenile person tried in the Crown court&#151;they should be tried in
a Crown court in this country in the ordinary way. We currently try in
this country offences involving alleged homicide which have taken place
overseas. Your Lordships will remember particularly last
September&#146;s case at Colchester, where paratroopers were tried
for murder. There is no reason why juveniles who are charged with
murder cannot be tried in this country.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611064000149"></a>Unfortunately, this Bill misses the
opportunity and misses the trick. From Second Reading through all its
stages, we have advanced the argument that juveniles should be dealt
with as they are in this country. The Government have not listened on
this occasion. Again, I make no personal criticism of the Minister, but
it is a fact that a youngster in the same situation as the defendant
Martin would be liable to be charged and tried abroad by court martial
if the circumstances were appropriate.</p><p><a name="0611064000150"></a>This is not acceptable. We are living in
the21st century. There are people, particularly those who sit
on the Cross-Benches, who devote their lives tothe problems of
youngsters and who have made significant contributions to looking after
their welfare. That is the issue of principle that arises here. I have
not, though I was very much tempted, extended my amendment to cover all
civilians, which would be in line with the judgment of the European
Court that I quoted to your Lordships. I have confined it to the
specific instance of juveniles. I shall seek your Lordships&#146;
support in due course after hearing what the Minister says. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0611064000151"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew83"></a><a name="0611064000759"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, I remind the House of my
interest as a serving TA officer. I have a lot of sympathy for this
amendment, because I would not want to find myself on a court martial
dealing with such a case. However, the amendment makes no provision for
an alternative. If your Lordships accept it, how and where would
serious charges other than manslaughter and murder, which can be dealt
with in the Crown court, be prosecuted? Unless the noble Lord can
provide an answer, he should exercise some caution before testing the
opinion of your Lordships'
House.</p><p><a name="0611064000152"></a><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew84"></a><a name="0611064000760"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 5 would prevent
civilians who are under 18 years of age from being tried before the
court martial. On24 October, the European Court of Human
Rights gave its judgment in the case of Martin. We need to be clear
about what it decided.</p><p><a name="0611064000153"></a>The case
was about the son of a serviceman who was tried by court martial in
1995 for the murder of a civilian in Germany. The court martial was
subjectto the same objections as were found to exist
inthe Findlay case in 1996, which were remedied by the Armed
Forces Act 1996. It is no surprise that the European Court decided in
Martin that the court martial was not compliant. The European Court did
not decide that courts martial should not try civilians, or that they
should not try civilian juveniles; it stated the important principle
that a military jurisdiction should be exercised over civilians only if
there are compelling reasons to do so. In the case of Martin, there was
the possibility of civilian trial in the UK because the charge was
murder.</p>

<p><a name="0611064000154"></a>The European Court did
not decide whether there had been compelling reasons for court martial
trial. It did not need to, because it decided the case on the basis
that the court martial at that time was not 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compliant. The court did not go into what it thought would be compelling
reasons.</p><h5><a name="0611064000198"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="0611064000155"></a>In the Martincase, the
reasons for court martial trial were mainly to do with the availability
of witnesses, most of whom were German. However, there were
case-specific factors that might have suggested that it would have been
better to try him in a UK court: besides his age, Martin was no longer
subject to service law; he had been back in the UK for over a year; and
his father was no longer in the Army. The European Court commented that
it had considerable doubts about whether it would have found the
reasons for court martial trial compelling in this particular
case.</p><p><a name="0611064000156"></a>Looking more generally,
however, I believe that we should provide for all civilians subject to
service discipline to be subject to a system of investigation and trial
that will apply the criminal law of England and Wales, that conducts
its proceedings in English and that is ECHR compliant. This is
especially important for contractors and others who increasingly
accompany our forces on operations abroad. It is in the vital interests
of the services themselves, of the civilians who live and work with
them and of the civilian population among whom they operate that there
is a fair and robust system of justice outside the UK to deal with
offences by civilians as well as service
personnel.</p><p><a name="0611064000157"></a>We must recognise that
the use of civilians deployed with our Armed Forces has increased in
recent years. This is the reason for our general approach in this area.
But the largest constituency affected is service families overseas, and
we realise that some 20,000 or so children accompany them. This
presents real challenges. We must accept, however, that from time to
time these under-18s may commit serious offences against other service
dependants or even against service personnel in UK service bases
overseas.</p><p><a name="0611064000158"></a>In these circumstances,
as the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Kingsland, have said, the
foreign local jurisdiction may be highly undesirable. Even if it
affords a compliant court, it will not apply the law of England and
Wales and may not conduct proceedings in English. If an accused is
convicted, his punishment may not be one that exists in the UK and any
period of detention would not be served in the
UK.</p><p><a name="0611064000159"></a>Perhaps, however, I can allay
some of the fears that noble Lords may have about juveniles routinely
being tried by the court martial. This simply will not be the case. In
the vast majority of cases, civilians will be tried in the service
civilian court, which is of course presided over by a civilian judge
advocate. In relation to adults, this court has the same powers as a
magistrates&#146; court in England and Wales, which means that for an
adult accused it may try any offence that in England would not have to
be tried in the Crown
court.</p><p><a name="0611064000160"></a>However, in relation to
juveniles, the offences that the service civilian court may try are
more numerous. When dealing with a juvenile, the service civilian court
has the same powers as a youth court in 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_611"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>England and Wales. This means that the service civilian court is able to
try any offence of which a juvenile is accused except the homicide
offences, certain firearms offences and offences where an adult would
face 14 years&#146;
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="0611064000161"></a>Noble Lords will
see, therefore, that only in exceptional circumstances would a juvenile
civilian appear before the court martial. On those occasions when they
do, the court will of course be presided over by a civilian judge
advocate who will have had the same training as Crown court judges in
relation to juveniles. Furthermore, in the Bill we have the ability to
provide that, when civilians appear before the court martial, the lay
members are themselves civilians&#151;indeed, it may be that the
entire panel will be civilian. These provisions will be contained in
court martial rules, which will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, so noble Lords will have adequate opportunity to
scrutinise them in due course.</p><p><a name="0611064000162"></a>I
hope that the provisions in relation to civilians and juveniles in
particular will lead noble Lords to see the amendment as unnecessary
and undesirable. In view of the reasons that I have given, I hope that
the noble Lord will agree to withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="0611064000163"></a><b><a name="61106-0004.htm_spnew85"></a><a name="0611064000761"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, the noble Earl,
Lord Attlee, has pointed out the gap or hole in the Bill. In response,
the Minister pointed to the fact that a juvenile will be dealt with by
a single judge advocate who has the powers of a judge in a youth court.
Does that judge advocate have the training? It cannot be imagined that
a senior judge advocate will be sitting over juveniles. He is
apparently not to be assisted by any lay people with experience in
dealing with children, as happens in the juvenile courts in England and
Wales and the juvenile panels in Scotland. So there is a
hole.</p><p><a name="0611064000164"></a>The noble Earl, Lord
Attlee, is right to say that we have not filled the hole. I do not
think that I can. I cannot import into this Bill a whole provision for
setting up a satisfactory youth court that will be the equivalent of
the youth courts and youth panels in this country and have that sort of
experience to accompany it. Some 20,000 of our juvenile citizens, if
they are in trouble, will come before a judge advocate&#151;very
probably a deputy judge advocate who comes from the Bar for the
purpose, without the proper training or the knowledge of all the
possibilities for rehabilitation and so on that apply in our youth
courts and youth panels.</p><p><a name="0611064000165"></a>So there
is a hole. It is impossible for me to fill it by an amendment to the
Bill, but it is important that your Lordships should sound a note of
principle to indicate that there is more work to be done and that we
have not reached the final position on military justice by passing this
Bill. The opportunity has been missed, and that is sad. I should have
wished this to be a complete Bill that would have covered the whole
situation for the next 10, 20 or 30 years. But that is not the case.
There is a hole in the Bill, and I hope that noble Lords will mark that
hole by supporting the amendment. I should like to seek the opinion of
the House.</p>

grateful to the Minister for his agreement on Report that we should
defer debating this amendment until Third Reading. Amendment No. 6
seeks to constrain the manner in which those members of the Armed
Forces under the age of 18 may be used and treated. There would be a
prohibition on service in combat areas, and they would be prohibited
from guarding using live weapons. The amendment also requires special
handling of those members of the Armed Forces who are under
17.</p><p><a name="0611066000003"></a>I described in Committee how
the amendment would implement the clear recommendations stemming from
Nicholas Blake QC&#146;s investigation into the tragedy of Deepcut
barracks. I also explained our disappointment over the
Government&#146;s response to the Blake report. I remind your
Lordships what the Blake report said. Recommendation 3
was:</p><ul><a name="0611066000048"></a>&#147;The Army should
plan to eliminate the need for soldiers to join their units in the
field army on completion of Phase 1 and 2 training until they reach the
age of
18&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000036"></a>Recommendation
27(iii) said:<ul><a name="0611066000049"></a>&#147;The
minimum age for trained soldiers in the field army to conduct
unsupervised armed guard duty should be
18&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000037"></a>Recommendation
2(i) said:<ul><a name="0611066000050"></a>&#147;Those under
17 should be trained in establishments exclusive to this age
group&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000038"></a>The
Government, in their response to the report, have given various reasons
why they are either unwilling or do not have the resources to implement
those recommendations. <p><a name="0611066000004"></a>In any
event, it should not have needed the horrors that we all read about and
debated following Deepcut to make the Government face up to their
responsibilities in this area. On 24 July 2003, the United Kingdom
ratified the UN optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. This
protocol says in Article
1:</p><ul><a name="0611066000051"></a>&#147;States Parties shall
take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces
who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in
hostilities&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000039"></a>Article
3 recognises that,
<ul><a name="0611066000052"></a>&#147;persons under the age of 18
years are entitled to special protection&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000040"></a>The amendment both deals with the Blake
recommendations and brings us in line with what we have ratified in the
UN protocol.<p><a name="0611066000005"></a>The Minister wrote
to me on 24 October. I, too, pay tribute to the ceaseless work that
both he and the staff have done in briefing us and keeping us aware.
The problem is that there is always no change; and there are always
explanations of why there is no intent to modernise in this Bill, but
merely to bring together ancient law. I would be grateful if the
Minister could tell us which other European nations take the view that
under-18s can be put into combat. His letter tells me that the
proposals by Blake and ourselves regarding combat areas
ignore,</p><ul><a name="0611066000053"></a>&#147;the practical
reality that does very occasionally arise. For example, ships have been
diverted to operations at minutes&#146;
notice&#148;.</ul>

obligations under the protocol. It should not place under-18s in a
position where it knows that this may happen. It is not terribly
difficult to keep them in the training area if there are going to be
under-18s in the armed services. If the MoD is to hold to its position
where the United Kingdom is internationally criticised for its policy
and will not put in place these most basic safeguards, we shall
subsequently need to examine carefully whether recruiting under-18s
into the military should continue in this country. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0611066000007"></a><b><a name="61106-0004.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="0611066000350"></a>Lord
Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, we cannot support the
amendment. I believe that it would be inappropriate and unnecessarily
restrictive to put such a provision in statutory form, worthy though
some of the motives behind doing so may be.</p><p><a name="0611066000008"></a>There are long-established and important
procedures relating to under-18s, some of which the noble Lord referred
to in Committee. These are designed to protect the safety of juvenile
service personnel and to control their exposure to dangerous
situations. Such guidance will undoubtedly be further updated following
the Deepcut inquiry. There is no need to tie the hands of the Armed
Forces by having these restrictions in statutory form. That could
compromise the efforts of our services in certain limited situations.
There are already safeguards in place and severe recriminations when
guidelines are not followed.</p><p><a name="0611066000009"></a>If
the noble Lord, Lord Garden, decides to call another Division, we will
vote against the
amendment.</p><p><a name="0611066000010"></a><b><a name="61106-0004.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="0611066000351"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, I oppose the amendment. First,
new subsection (1) does not have sufficient flexibility to implement
the UN protocol. For instance, as drafted, it would mean that service
personnel under 18 could not deploy on overseas exercises or
ships&#151;certainly not overseas exercises outside NATO or EU
states. A good example was the exercise Saif Sareea in 2001 in Oman,
which partially morphed into
operations.</p><p><a name="0611066000011"></a>Secondly, subsection
(2) is still ambiguously drafted. Is a live weapon one with live rounds
in it, or one that works? Either way, I believe that it is morally and
doctrinally wrong to put on guard a service person with an impotent
firearm.</p><p><a name="0611066000012"></a>Thirdly, if under-18s
cannot undertake armed guard duty, will that not lead to some
installations not being provided with an armed guard at all because it
is unfair to overload over-18s with armed guard duty? The military
provost guard service is not a free service; it is not even
cheap.</p><p><a name="0611066000013"></a>Finally, under-18s could
have been in uniform for 12 months and they will not thank noble Lords
on the Liberal Democrat Benches, because the advantage that they sought
by starting their service careers early will be to some extent lost and
they will be made into second-tier servicepersons unable to perform all
military tasks. Possibly even worse, the Armed Forces Pay Review Board
might have to look at their already meagre
pay.</p>

Lyell:</b> My Lords, I listened carefully to the
noble Lord, Lord Garden, presenting and explaining his amendment. When
I looked at it before he spoke, it seemed like a multiple independent
military vehicle. First, it says clearly in subsection (1),</p><ul><a name="0611066000054"></a>&#147;under the age of
18&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000041"></a>I was not aware
until my noble friend Lord Attlee spoke that training for such action
could begin at such a young age.
<p><a name="0611066000015"></a>I apologise for taking your Lordships back
to 1957 when I served for two years under the National Service Act, and
three members of my squad celebrated their 18th birthdays during the
first three weeks of our training. I know that circumstances have
changed. I hope that the Minister will not dally unduly with my sundry
thoughts. Perhaps he will cover my queries in writing; I am not asking
for a reply this afternoon. I am interested to know that it would be
possible for young men, and possibly young women, under the age of 18
to serve in combat areas. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Garden,
explained that detailing who will or will not be in their 19th year in
a ship&#146;s company when the ship might be called into action would
be extraordinarily difficult. Such a provision would be extraordinarily
hard for all three services, especially as they are
now.</p><p><a name="0611066000016"></a>I have great sympathy with
subsection (2), and understand it, thanks to the tragic events at
Deepcut. But how would that subsection mix with what we understand from
subsection (1), and with what my noble friend said&#151;that young
men and women may start their training at the age of 17? If they are
permitted to serve in a combat area or are deemed safe to use live
weapons, why should they be proscribed from carrying out guard duty
with live weapons under the watershed age of 18? I look forward to
hearing what the Minister has to say about subsection (3) which states
that,</p><ul><a name="0611066000055"></a>&#147;dedicated
locations, and particular attention is to be given to their
care&#148;.</ul><a name="0611066000042"></a>That is
praiseworthy but no doubt the Minister will have an excellent
explanation. I do not seek to waste more of your Lordships&#146; time
this afternoon.<h5><a name="0611066000057"></a>4.30

Slim:</b> My Lords, I may be corrected, but while
going around the apprentice college at Harrogate and the subsequent
training facility at Catterick, I have observed that one can be a
trained soldier at 17 just as well as at 18. They have the same
responsibilities. One cannot base something on a terrible scene in one
area, which none of us liked and which had nothing to do with people
being 17. There were other reasons for those problems. If we start to
create second-class soldiers, as one or two noble Lords have said, we
will have grave problems.</p><p><a name="0611066000018"></a>I have
looked hard at the apprentice school in Harrogate and the subsequent
training at Catterick, as I have had the great privilege of spending
some time there. I do not see much difference between what comes out of
either pile. In the last world war, young men of 17 and 16 in the Home
Guard carried loaded weapons and were prepared to fire them if the
enemy landed. Many 17 year-olds joined up saying they were

nothing but have an adverse effect on recruitment. I cannot support the
noble Lord, Lord Garden, with all his best intentions, in this
amendment.</p><p><a name="0611066000019"></a><b><a name="61106-0004.htm_spnew91"></a><a name="0611066000354"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, before turning to Amendment
No. 6, I want to say that during our most useful debate in Committee,
the noble Lord, Lord Garden, mentioned that I may have been mistaken in
referring to recruits under the age of 18 at Harrogate. Of course, he
was quite correct in believing that the training facilities at
Harrogate were exclusively for those under 17 rather than under 18.
While he graciously conceded that that was a minor point, my use of the
generic term &#147;under 18&#148; was clearly not right in that
context. I gladly now put the record straight by emphasising that the
training facilities at Harrogate are, indeed, for
under-17s.</p><p><a name="0611066000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Garden, expressed the view that he was disappointed with our response
to Nicholas Blake in the Deepcut review, specifically in relation to
our duty of care towards service personnel under the age of 18. I can
assure noble Lords that the Ministry of Defence welcomed Mr
Blake&#146;s report. Many of the recommendations were accepted and
some have already been acted upon.</p><p><a name="0611066000021"></a>On the accommodation of those under the
age of 17, I can only repeat and re-emphasise what I have said
previously. We fully appreciate the specific requirements of those
under the age of 18. Therefore, although the Army has some training
facilities exclusively for recruits under the age of 17 at Harrogate
and Bassingbourn, with some under-17s also being trained at other
training establishments, we do not believe that accommodating under-17s
separately from their colleagues is an appropriate approach to adopt
across the whole of the Armed Forces. We are instead concentrating on
improving accommodation for all recruits. Improvements to the training
environment will continue to be taken forward through the defence
training review.</p><p><a name="0611066000022"></a>As I told noble
Lords, an important aspect of a serviceperson&#146;s training and of
service life is the ability and confidence to handle live weapons. A
fully trained and qualified service man or woman must be able to bear
arms in legitimate pursuit of the operational imperative, and we would
not want to rule out the possibility of suitability qualified personnel
aged 17 or over having been judged by their commanding officer to have
the maturity and appropriate attitude to take personal responsibility
for a firearm with live rounds.</p>

<p><a name="0611066000023"></a>As I have made it clear, under-17s
entrusted to do that are accompanied by an appropriately trained and
qualified serviceperson when they undertake armed patrolling duties.
Those supervising, and indeed all in the chain of command, fully
appreciate the weight of those responsibilities and take appropriate
measures in relation to the safety and well-being of those young
people. In relation to the use of under-18s in operations, the United
Kingdom position is the result of a historical anomaly. It is based on
a relatively recent assessment of the requirements of the services 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_618"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and our obligations under the United Nations convention. Indeed,
guidance issued to the services ensures that if units are given notice
to deploy to operations, under-18s will almost invariably be
removed.</p><p><a name="0611066000024"></a>The
decision to remove a serviceperson under the age of 18 from a ship or
unit before deploying will be taken whenever possible, but that
decision must be balanced against the effect that it might have on the
ability to successfully achieve the military aim. For example, if a
rapid deployment is essential and that deployment is mounted from other
than the home base, it might not be possible to remove someone under 18
to safety. We can no longer rely on the relatively static disposition
of our forces on the European mainland. We must accept that if units,
particularly ships but also other detached units&#151;as is
increasingly common these days&#151;are already deployed and an
emergency arises, while every practical step will be taken to remove or
land under-18s, that simply might not be possible.</p><p><a name="0611066000025"></a>In recent years, HMS
&#147;Illustrious&#148; was deployed with no notice from exercises
in the Bay of Biscay to support operations in Sierra Leone. The tragic
events of 9/11 occurred while significant numbers of UK forces were
transiting to or deployed in Oman. The recent evacuation of civilians
from the Lebanon was conducted in large part by ships already in the
area. Noble Lords will know that events can turn as quickly as this,
and that our forces must be prepared to deal with them when and where
they arise. We fully recognise our responsibility towards under-18s.
That is why in almost every case under-18s will not face hostilities.
That said, we must not underestimate the importance to the services
that under-18s who have completed their training can be employed
immediately in front-line ships and units. It is true that in
exceptional circumstances that might expose them to hostilities, but as
I have demonstrated, the likelihood is extremely low.</p><p><a name="0611066000026"></a>The UK&#146;s declaration on signing the
UN protocol makes it clear that we do all we can and we could not be
more aware of our obligations in that area. We believe that our
policies on under-18s are robust and compliant with national and
international law, but we continue to keep them under review.</p><p><a name="0611066000027"></a>Let me be clear about our position on
service personnel under the age of 18 serving in combat zones. Of
course we would prefer to be able to offer a cast-iron guarantee that
this situation would never arise, but while every precaution is taken
to avoid the potential for that to happen, a small risk remains, even
with the most careful thought and planning. I attach the utmost
importance to our duty of care for all our service personnel. We need
to consider carefully how we may best achieve that by balancing our
obligations towards those aged under 18, reflecting their particular
needs and at the same time avoiding the risk of causing barriers
between them and their older colleagues. I remain confident that the
needs of service personnel under the age of 18 are being properly
addressed and that there is no need to introduce primary legislation to
enforce special provision for these young service men and
women.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_619"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611066000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Garden, asked me which
other European nations put under-18s into combat, and the answer is
none. However, many of those countries have systems of national service
and conscription and operate in a non-expeditionary role, which is
quite different from us. It is therefore not a fair
comparison.</p><p><a name="0611066000029"></a>Although I fully
understand the noble Lord&#146;s genuine and strongly held views in
this area, I hope that he is now reassured by my explanation and is
prepared to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="0611066000030"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="0611066000355"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, the Minister will be
unsurprised that I have not been reassured by his reiteration of the
Government&#146;s position. Various noble Lords explained why it is
difficult to do the things that this amendment requires. It is
certainly difficult, but there is an international perspective that 18
is the make-or-break age for whether someone should be in combat
wearing a uniform. That can be seen in the UN protocol, in the
definition of child soldiers and in the way the rest of Europe acts. I
am most grateful to the Minister for confirming&#151;I thought it
would be better coming from him&#151;that no other European nation
has under-18s. To say that they do not deploy is not correct; just look
at Afghanistan at the moment. It was an extraordinary statement. The
argument used by some noble Lords about soldiers being very good at 17
works just as well if they are 13. Why do we take a particular age? We
take it because there is an international standardof
18.</p><p><a name="0611066000031"></a>Then there is Deepcut. Over
a prolonged period, noble Lords showed their horror at what happened
there. It is a separate matter, a subset of this under-18 question. We
questioned how it could happen and, after so much angst, we welcomed a
proper inquiry into it by a respected QC. When we read his report, some
of us thought that he did not go far enough in some of his
recommendations. Nevertheless, it was an objective assessment. He made
some simple recommendations, and I remind noble Lords that when he said
that he was prepared to accept the continuation of under-18s in the
Armed Forces as servicemen, he did so not on the grounds of
recruitment, which is the argument normally made by the Ministry of
Defence, but on the grounds of education; he felt they got a better
education if they were in the services than they might get in the state
system between the ages of 16 and 18. That was why he justified it, but
he did so with the caveat that his recommendations should be
implemented.</p><p><a name="0611066000032"></a>We all know that
the MoD will not agree to under-17s having special areas because of the
resources question. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, says that subsection
(2) in the amendment is impractical because there are insufficient
resources. We are taking about budgetary concerns, when there is an
international standard for under-18s. While I accept that there will be
some exercises in which under-18s will not be able to participate, that
is a relatively small price to pay to raise ourselves to normal,
international, civilised standards. I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</p>

subsection (1) can absolve the commanding officer from his
responsibilities under international
treaties.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06110620000009"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall be brief in moving Amendment No. 7,
not because it is unimportant but because we discussed it at each stage
of the Bill when noble Lords were most helpful in developing its
language. I considered the suggestions made by the noble Earl, Lord
Attlee, on Report about the importance of broadening the scope of the
amendment to cover all the services rather than only the commanding
officer. While I am sympathetic to that, we have achieved a wording
that is focused and appropriate and that received a degree of consensus
around the House on Report.</p><p><a name="06110620000010"></a>The
aim of the amendment is to ensure that commanding officers are not put
in an impossible position when mysterious foreign aircraft are given
clearance to make use of their facilities. I remind noble Lords that
such occasions have arisen at Royal Air Force Brize Norton and Royal
Air Force Northolt, as we have heard. In getting the language right, I
wish to acknowledge the great assistance given by the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, in reminding us of the responsibilities of a commanding
officer. They cannot be abrogated, which is an important element of the
new clause. It makes it possible for the Defence Council to make the
necessary regulations in order to clarify what commanding officers
should do, although they cannot absolve themselves of their
responsibilities under international
law.</p><p><a name="06110620000011"></a>Our debates have inevitably
focused specifically on extraordinary rendition and the universal
abhorrence of such flights where suspects are transported to distant
locations to be interrogated under conditions which amount to torture
under the international definitions. I know that we will examine the
amendment with that in mind. However, I have made it forward-looking in
the sense that it gives the Defence Council the authority to look at
other possible violations of international law. One might think of
cases where there is a breaking of international sanctions in
transferring weapons to a theatre by air or other breaches of
international law.</p><p><a name="06110620000012"></a>This is the
opportunity to give commanding officers the appropriate guidance so
that they will not

helping to facilitate torture or other breaches of international law.
Such cases can be brought. In Committee, I referred to a case in Italy
where a military officer had been charged in connection with
extraordinary rendition.</p><p><a name="06110620000013"></a>We have
argued the case sufficiently and have all reached an
agreement&#151;including on the Government Benches&#151;that we
abhor extraordinary rendition. This amendment would discharge our
responsibilities to people in the military in difficult circumstances
commanding military airfields through which flights are being directed
under uncertain circumstances. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06110620000098"></a>5
pm</h5><p><a name="06110620000014"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew94"></a><a name="06110620000102"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I shall be brief.
We now know, as the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, said on 12 October, that
arrangements for these flights are,</p><ul><a name="06110620000095"></a>&#147;part of the normal
arrangements between states&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
12/10/06; col. 440.]</ul><a name="06110620000077"></a>We
also know, from the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, on 18
October (at cols. 782 and 783 of the <I>Official Report</I>) that these
were not arrangements made between the UK and the US. The grant to
foreign aircraft to overfly or leave our military airfields in the UK
was given by diplomatic clearance under &#147;customary&#148; and
reciprocal international law of which the principles were not clear.
That had happened &#147;for decades&#148;, and the Chicago
Convention does not apply. She also said that we expect that if there
is something to do with rendition then they will tell us, but that
there is no obligation to do so.
<p><a name="06110620000015"></a>The right in this arrangement, which has
apparently gone on for decades, is diplomatic clearance sought with or
without permission. I do not know quite what that means. If you are
seeking diplomatic clearance, I think that means that you are asking
permission, and I assume that that permission is either without asking
the purpose or not. I am a bit lost in that diplomatic
sea.</p><p><a name="06110620000016"></a>Where do we go from here if
that is right? The United Kingdom cannot unilaterally opt out of such
an international arrangement, which by custom is not justiciable and
could not be enforced in any court of law. Resorting to the ECHR, the
Human Rights Act 1998 and other international conventions would also be
excluded, as you cannot challenge the operation of diplomatic
conventions in any court of law. This amendment is destined to drift
into the &#147;ebb-drawn shoals&#148; of an Orcadian poet, in which
the series of sister amendments already lie in limbo.</p><p><a name="06110620000017"></a>The intendiment of this amendment could
be dealt with through bilateral agreement between the United States and
ourselves. That would require granting clearance to overfly and so
forth&#151;and taking off in the UK only if satisfied as to
compliance with legal requirements and international obligations, the
provisions for inspection provided by the US for take-off and with
regard to passenger lists or bills of lading for cargoes of weaponry.
It is not for me to draft the provisions of such an agreement, but I 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_624"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 624</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mention this to show the sort of arrangement that could be made by
diplomacy. It is really beyond the point to ask why permission was
granted for twoout of four flights. What happened to the large
remainder? Why was no explanation of these arrangements&#151;I am
glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, in his place&#151;given in
response to my Unstarred Question, on which I was helped by my noble
friend Lord Kingsland?</p><p><a name="06110620000018"></a>On 18 July, we had no inkling of what I
have mentioned to your Lordships today. Indeed, no one had an inkling
before 12 or 18 October. I am not saying this to criticise the
Government because there is no use in doing so. Neither is there any
use in asking a whole series of questions that you might as well ask
Martin Gilliatt&#146;s one-glass-eyed teddy
bear.</p><p><a name="06110620000019"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06110620000103"></a>Lord
Lyell:</b> My Lords, I hope that I will not be
considered mischievous, but I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord
Garden, let alone my noble friend Lord Kingsland, might be able to
explain &#147;flights by foreign aircrafts&#148;, which is in the
plural and in heavy print. To what do these refer? The noble Lord, Lord
Garden, referred to two Royal Air Force stations&#151;I think Brize
Norton and Northolt. It may interest him to know about Royal Air Force
Macrahanish, an airport with very large facilities that is not too far
from the home of my noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton. Various
sightings have been reported in the Scottish media of exotic types of
aircraft, which I presume were on their way to various bases, perhaps
elsewhere in Europe. I hope they are not flying saucers or other flying
machines. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, and other noble Lords who have
spoken have made a case for the Minister to clarify. I simply wonder
why &#147;foreign aircrafts&#148; are in the
plural.</p><p><a name="06110620000020"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06110620000104"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I spoke at some length in
Committee about what I saw as the legal position on this matter, and I
am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Garden, for his remarks about
that this afternoon. I shall simply summarise to your Lordships once
more what I believe that legal position to be. If a commanding officer
on station apprehends that a foreign aircraft that has landed at his
aerodrome contains someone who is on their way to being tortured, he
has a binding legal duty to inspect the contents of that plane
irrespective of any superior orders in the chain of command. If he does
not do that, he will be complicit in the international crime of torture
and personally liable to be prosecuted under international criminal
law. Therefore, whatever amendment we make to the Bill on this matter
will, strictly speaking, be irrelevant because the legal duty is there.
It is inescapable for the
Government.</p><p><a name="06110620000021"></a>Since Committee, the
noble Lord, Lord Garden, has been thinking about how he can deal with
this matter, and I am perfectly content with the amendment that he has
come up with now. It seems in no way to cut across my analysis of the
legal position. While I do not think it is necessary, it is in every
other respect compliant, which is why I have put my name to
it.</p><p><a name="06110620000022"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="06110620000105"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, I strongly support this
amendment. Our Armed Forces should have nothing 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_625"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do with extraordinary rendition. It is just as abhorrent as slavery
and as easy to detect. I accept the view put forward by the noble Lord,
Lord Garden, on my amendment about widening the provision. But it is
clear that an officer in the staff, in the chain of command, will be
involved in the planning of any extraordinary rendition flight should
it occur. The staff must be clear on their position and their legal
responsibilities. I strongly support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110620000023"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew98"></a><a name="06110620000106"></a>Lord
Boyce:</b> My Lords, I wish to approach this
amendment from a slightly more practical point of view. The noble Lord,
Lord Garden, has said that one reason for the amendment could be to
avoid putting the commanding officer in an impossible situation. But
the practical aspects of this will achieve exactly that and will put
him in an impossible situation.</p><p><a name="06110620000024"></a>The responsibility for a foreign aircraft
landing at one of our military airfields is with the Foreign Office,
which gives the diplomatic clearance, not the commanding officer. If
there is a suspicion or worry that an aircraft may be doing something
improper, such as being used for extraordinary rendition, it is up to
the Foreign Office to deny that flight. It is not for the commanding
officer to sort out when he gets it on to his airfield. The noble Lord,
Lord Kingsland, has made it clear that the amendment is unnecessary
because there is a legal binding duty on him to search the aircraft if
he thinks that there is extraordinary rendition. But he should not be
expected to search every aircraft that arrives in case it is doing
something illegal. That should not be his responsibility. If it is, it
will lay on him a most enormous burden. In comprehending the
implications of the amendment, we must also think about what will
happen to our military aircraft when they go through other military
airfields where, presumably, there will be some tit-for-tat and
reciprocation in treating our aircraft similarly. I do not believe that
this amendment is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06110620000025"></a><b><a name="61106-0005.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="06110620000107"></a>Lord

Boyce.</p>

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I shall deal in some detail
with all relevant issues that arise out of this amendment. Having done
so, I hope that noble Lords will agree that it is not an appropriate
clause for this Armed Forces Bill. As we have heard, the amendment
obviously raises the issue of extraordinary rendition. I do not intend
to spend any time on that, first, because the Government&#146;s
position has been set out on many occasions and is clear, and,
secondly, because I believe that when considering a Bill dealing with
the Armed Forces it is not appropriate to be sidetracked from this. We
all know that this Bill is principally designed to provide a system of
law for our Armed Forces which will allow them to continue to operate
to the high standards that they consistently achieve now and ensure
that they do so well into the future. So I want to concentrate on the
issues that are relevant to this Bill&#151;the issues that are
relevant to our Armed Forces&#151;as I am sure do noble Lords. I
consider that the only relevant issue is regarding the 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_626"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 626</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>responsibilities of servicemen and, in particular, commanding officers.
I can confirm that my noble friend Lord Triesman would be happy to
offer noble Lords a detailed briefing and discussion to explain the
legal aspects relating to extraordinary rendition if that were felt to
be helpful.</p><p><a name="06110620000027"></a>The motivation of the noble Lord, Lord
Garden, on this amendment is, I believe, the vulnerability of the
commanding officer to criminal prosecution. I believe that that is
misplaced in a number of respects with which I will now deal. It does
not work and, even if it could be adjusted, it would add nothing to
what is already provided for in general domestic law. First, I will
deal with the arrangements that already exist for the handling of
foreign aircraft at military facilities. Civilian aircraft are subject
to the provisions of the Chicago Convention, which generally permits
such aircraft to make flights into, or transit across, the territory of
the United Kingdom. The convention does not prohibit UK civilian
authorities entering the aircraft or dealing with any suspected
criminal activity on
board.</p><p><a name="0611065000001"></a>It
is therefore open to the three authorities that have responsibility for
our borders&#151;the police, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
and the UK Immigration Service&#151;to carry out investigations if
they consider that there is reason to suspect such criminal activity.
This is of course subject to any diplomatic or sovereign immunity that
applies. We cannot alter this. For example, if the Defence Council made
regulations under this amendment that purported to empower our police
to open diplomatic property, far from meeting international
obligations, we would end up in breach of them.</p><h5><a name="0611065000027"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="0611065000002"></a>Although they are not subject
to the Chicago Convention, all foreign state aircraft, including
military aircraft, must not fly over the territory of another state or
land without authorisation by special agreement or otherwise. When a
military aircraft wishes to fly over or land in the territory of the
UK, whether at a military or a civilian airfield, it must obtain
diplomatic flight clearance. Diplomatic clearance is a process that is
designed to control UK airspace. If we were to suspect wrongdoing on
aircraft, we could refuse
clearance.</p><p><a name="0611065000003"></a>I know that some
interest was expressed in the management of the process of diplomatic
clearance. It is not relevant to the issues with which this amendment
purports to deal, but, if it aids understanding, I am happy to explain
it. Such clearances are dealt with by the MoD commitments staff who are
responsible for the air defence of the United Kingdom. This process is
designed to contribute to the defence of the UK, not to the enforcement
of the criminal law. Bilateral agreements are in place with some
countries that allow them not to apply for such clearance on a routine
basis, but, even then, they must seek individual authority where they
are carrying dangerous air cargo or VIPs.</p><p><a name="0611065000004"></a>Information on this procedure is provided
by the MoD to all embassies and high commissions. It makes it clear
that there are rules that apply to the granting of such clearance. The
information includes, 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for example, reference to the applicability of customs and immigration
requirements. It does not make specific reference to complying more
generally with the domestic law or with international law, but such
issues are taken as read. Where we give clearance, it does not provide
any immunity to the aircraft to which it is granted, although foreign
military aircraft and personnel sometimes have some immunity under
international
law.</p><p><a name="0611065000005"></a>The
powers that our authorities could exercise in the circumstances would
have to be decided by considering the facts of each case. It has to be
recognised that we cannot override international law. However, I can
assure the House that, should there be any evidence to suggest that any
state was using the UK criminally to render people through it, the
matter would immediately be taken up with the state involved to resolve
the situation.</p><p><a name="0611065000006"></a>The Government
are more than satisfied that the police, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs and the UK Immigration Service have sufficient legal powers
to deal with any criminal activity. What powers they can exercise over
foreign individuals and property will depend on the circumstances, but
this is governed by international law. We cannot introduce legislation
that goes beyond what international law
allows.</p><p><a name="0611065000007"></a>Subject to international
law, our authorities are able to react to any intelligence that
suggests that an offence is being committed when foreign aircraft
transit through our jurisdiction, including our military airfields. The
guidance issued to embassies is being updated by the MoD. I would be
more than happy to undertake to leave a copy of that guidance in the
House Library if it would be of assistance.</p><p><a name="0611065000008"></a>However, I hope that I have clarified in
general terms what the process entails and, in particular, the fact
that we already control the entry of such aircraft into our airspace
and can deal with any criminal activities that they might undertake.
The amendment would not add anything more to
this.</p><p><a name="0611065000009"></a>I am afraid that subsection
(2) of the proposed amendment would, again, add nothing. Of course
commanding officers&#151;like anyone else&#151;must not become
parties to crime. As for the commanding officers&#146;
&#147;responsibilities under international treaties&#148;, I am
afraid that this is a misunderstanding of how international law
operates. Treaties are made by and between states. They create
obligations and responsibilities for states and a breach of treaty
obligations is a matter of state and not individual
responsibility.</p><p><a name="0611065000010"></a><b><a name="61106-0006.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="0611065000271"></a>Lord

<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_628"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611065000012"></a>A treaty whose purpose is to criminalise
certain behaviour achieves its effect through the domestic law. So, for
example, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and torture are a
crime under UK law because of our domestic legislation. By ratifying
the Geneva Conventions, states expressly undertake to enact legislation
necessary to provide effective penal sanctions. The position is much
the same in relation to the torture convention. The convention does not
require criminal liability to be imposed on a person unless they are a
party to a crime. The reality is therefore that compliance with our
domestic law will avoid any criminal
responsibility.</p><p><a name="0611065000013"></a>But I would add
that, if the commanding officer suspects that any offence is being
committed, he should take what steps he can to ensure that it is
investigated. He could not be told by anyone not to do so. Depending on
the circumstances, it would probably be sufficient for him to call in
the police. This would apply to any other serviceman, too, and indeed
to any civilian who had such concerns. Of course he himself would
commit a criminal offence only if the nature of his involvement crossed
the threshold of criminal liability. If there was evidence that it had,
this would quite rightly be a matter for the normal prosecutions and
trial processes.</p><p><a name="0611065000014"></a>To conclude, we
are satisfied that the processes for handling foreign aircraft already
make sufficient provision for compliance with both domestic and
international law. The amendment could not give any more powers than
our authorities already have. Commanding officers are not exposed to an
unfair risk of prosecution. Most important, a commanding officer should
involve&#151;</p><p><a name="0611065000015"></a><b><a name="61106-0006.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="0611065000273"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for giving way. Could consideration be given to my suggestion
that there should be a bipartite diplomatic arrangement which in effect
contained the intendment of the amendment? I will not go over that
again. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, may be able to help on this
matter diplomatically. We are trying to establish this to show the
world that we and the United States are wholly opposed to extraordinary
rendition.</p><p><a name="0611065000016"></a><b><a name="61106-0006.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="0611065000274"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I will carefully read in
<I>Hansard</I> what the noble Lord has said and reflect on whether
there is any merit in what he suggests and whether it adds anything to
legislation as it exists.</p><p><a name="0611065000017"></a>If any
commanding officer were to become involved in criminal activity, he
would be liable to prosecution under criminal law&#151;and, of
course, it is right that he should be. I hope that that reassures noble
Lords on this matter and that as a result noble Lords will conclude
that the amendment is unnecessary. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw
it.</p><p><a name="0611065000018"></a><b><a name="61106-0006.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="0611065000275"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for going into so much detail at Third Reading, much of which we have
heard in relation not only to this Bill but to the Civil Aviation Bill
and the Police and Justice Bill, when dealing with associated topics.
Much of what he said was uncontentious, but he did not address the real
question of what the poor commanding officer does.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_629"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 629</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0611065000019"></a>I shall address some of the contributions
made by other noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked where the
extra &#147;s&#148; came from in &#147;aircrafts&#148; in the
amendment. I have no idea where it came from. We have been moving quite
rapidly with this Bill and the editing must have gone
wrong.</p><p><a name="0611065000020"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, referred to a bipartite
arrangement. My concern is that we now have clear evidence that the
definition of torture in the United States is not the definition of
torture that we understand in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, given
that the Vice-President can go on the media and apparently accept water
boarding as a reasonable form of
interrogation.</p><p><a name="0611065000021"></a>I am totally at
one, in one sense, with the noble and gallant Lords, Lord Boyce and
Lord Inge, in that what really worries me is that commanding officers
are being put in an impossible position. That was the concern. We have
heard from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that there is no escape from
this; the responsibility is clear. That is what subsection (2) of the
amendment says&#151;it merely restates the responsibility of
commanding officers. The problem is how they handle these things. We
have some guidance from the Minister, who says that if they have any
reason to suspect things they had better go out there and sort it out.
Perhaps that is an advance, but I would prefer there to be a Defence
Council instruction that told them what they should do in specific
circumstances. It is not a question of telling them to investigate
every foreign aircraft that lands; it is a question of giving them
guidance that they can turn
to.</p><p><a name="0611065000022"></a>Even noble Lords have had
great problems with establishing who is responsible for what under the
Chicago or the Tokyo conventions and so on. We are talking about some
poor commanding officer of an airfield, who has to make a judgment. For
that, he must have guidance&#151;and that guidance comes in the form
of Defence Council instructions. We have not said that the Defence
Council has to provide those instructions; we have said that it
&#147;may&#148; provide them. Indeed, I hope that it would provide
them&#151;but I am unaware of their existing at the
moment.</p><p><a name="0611065000023"></a>There is also a degree of
confusion around your Lordships' House about diplomatic clearances.
Unless systems have changed greatly since I was the commander of an
operational airfield, diplomatic clearances are done <I>en bloc</I>,
with a month&#146;s worth of flights to go to one place or another.
That is different from diplomatic immunity&#151;it is the system by
which the flights are managed. My great concern is that if we are
operating diplomatic block clearances for flights with a nation that
has a different definition of torture, we may find that commanding
officers are put in an impossible position, to use the phrase of the
noble and gallant Lords. We have a duty to offer advice, and this
clause would make it clear how that advice should be offered. I beg
leave to test the opinion of the
House.</p><h5><a name="0611065000028"></a>5.28
pm</h5><p><a name="0611065000024"></a>On Question, Whether the said
amendment (No. 7) shall be agreed to?</p>

to have reached agreement on a way forward. The House has discharged
honourably its role in scrutinising this Bill carefully, and I am
certainly very grateful to the Benches opposite for their constructive
approach to legislation that will bring benefits to patients.</p><p><a name="06110620000049"></a>Moved, That the House do not insist on

Howe:</b> My Lords, there are occasions when despite
all that has gone before it is right for this House to bow to the will
of the elected Chamber. With a considerable measure of regret, I
believe this to be one such occasion. Your Lordships&#146; House has
asked the other place to think again; the other place has rejected our
amendments on two separate occasions. It is therefore time to let the
Bill pass.</p><p><a name="06110620000051"></a>I say that with
regret because I believe as strongly as ever that the Bill represents a
missed opportunity. With a little more readiness by the Government to
recognise the point of principle underlying our earlier amendments, and
a greater willingness on their part to achieve a meeting of minds, the
Bill could have been improved very significantly. I recognise, of
course, that the Government have made concessions, and I do not
belittle those in the slightest. But the key point of principle that we
asked them to consider and agree to is not, in the end, one on which
they have seen fit to give way. That is an enormous pity and I believe
that the losers from that decision will be
patients.</p><p><a name="06110620000052"></a>I hope that the
Minister will allow me to use this opportunity to ask him a couple of
questions arising from the amendment passed in another place today.
First, can he give us further details of the intention behind the
amendment, because I am genuinely puzzled as to why the amendment is
necessary if it is simply to achieve the result described by the
Minister in another place? It may be designed to give the critics of
the Bill on this side of the House some comfort, and of course I
welcome that motivation, if it is that. But, if it is purely about
qualifications and experience, the Government could have ensured that
those stipulations were met in any event, without the need for an
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110620000053"></a>Secondly, will there
be an opportunity for the Opposition parties to look informally at the
draft regulations that are to be laid? It would be enormously helpful
if we could be afforded that opportunity to enable us to engage with
the Minister on the detail of the regulations at a reasonably early
stage.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_635"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 635</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110620000054"></a>Thirdly, I should be grateful if the
Minister could shed a little more light on one aspect of the redress
scheme, which I confess I still find puzzling. That is the issue of
privilege. We debated this the last time that the Bill was in this
House, and I know that the Minister was trying to be helpful on that
occasion. As I understand him, he told us that expert medical reports
are not to be privileged, yet any offer made by the NHSLA is to be
without prejudice. I still cannot see how those two positions can be
compatible. If an offer is made without prejudice it means that it is
not to be regarded as an admission of liability for the purposes of
subsequent litigation. Therefore, it seems to be a recipe for chaos:
someone could go through the redress scheme, receive an offer, reject
it with all legal rights intact and walk away, armed with material that
would ordinarily be privileged under the usual rules and practice of
common law. I question whether what the Minister told us will be
achievable in practice.</p><p><a name="06110620000055"></a>The
point was made eloquently in the Explanatory Notes for the Inquiries
Act at paragraph 9, which
says,</p><ul><a name="06110620000096"></a>&#147;as subsection
(2) is designed to make clear, it is not intended that the inquiry
should be hampered in its investigations by a fear that responsibility
may be inferred from a determination of a
fact&#148;.</ul><a name="06110620000078"></a>The solution
proposed by the Opposition would have meant that by separating
fact-finding from fault-finding the Bill would have provided a
conceptual and physical separation between privileged and
non-privileged information. Arising from those considerations, my
understanding is that in practice fact-finding and fault-finding will
amount to two separate processes within the ambit of the scheme. Can
the Minister confirm that? If he can, then quite possibly the dilemma
that I have just tried to point out may not arise because it would
remain possible for the NHSLA to treat some information as privileged
and some as non-privileged.
<p><a name="06110620000056"></a>If the investigatory process is single
and undivided, it seems inevitable to me that at least some information
will have to remain privileged, leaving open the possibility for the
authority, without any disrespect to it, to duck and dive behind the
concept of privilege whenever it wanted to. As I understand it, that is
not what it would want and not what the Government want, and I think it
should be avoided if possible.</p><p><a name="06110620000057"></a>In the knowledge that the noble Baroness,
Lady Neuberger, has some further points to add, I shall leave my
remarks there. I want to express my thanks to her, to her colleagues on
the Liberal Democrats Benches for their support and to the Minister for
his courteous and considerate replies at all stages of the Bill.
Putting our apprehensions aside, we genuinely wish the redress scheme
all success, not only for the sake of the NHS but also, and more
importantly, for the sake of
patients.</p><p><a name="06110620000058"></a><b><a name="61106-0007.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06110620000120"></a>Baroness
Neuberger:</b> My Lords, like the noble Earl, Lord
Howe, we have come to the conclusion that having sent the Bill back to
another place on two occasions, and it having been returned, we
probably now have to rest our case. When we saw Amendment 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_636"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 636</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>No. 16A, published on Thursday, we believed that a major concession had
been made, allowing in regulations a definition of the person
investigating the facts to be in some way independent of the NHS
organisation concerned. It did not state that in terms, but we thought
that that might well be the intention behind Amendment No.
16A.</p><p><a name="06110620000059"></a>Imagine our distress to
discover this morning in a meeting with the Minister in another place,
Andy Burnham, that independence was not to be brought in here and that,
despite trying twice to send the Bill back to the Commons with the
feelings of all sides of this House on the subject being made clear, we
had not persuaded the Government that trust in the scheme was of the
greatest importance and that independent oversight was therefore
essential. Although I accept that we shall not press this further, I
would be enormously grateful if the Minister could give us a clue as to
the intentions behind Amendment No. 16A if it is not to include some
element of independence in oversight of the
fact-finding.</p><p><a name="06110620000060"></a>We are somewhat
reassured by the fact that if someone is dissatisfied he can go to the
ombudsman. That applies only in cases of maladministration. We are
still left with two major concerns. The first, which we have all raised
in debating this issue on several occasions and which was so ably
expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, when we last debated it,
is that people just do not trust documents on the same writing paper as
that of the organisation about which they have originally complained.
We are delighted that the reports will be made available to the
patients. We regard that as a major step forward. We had hoped to see
more progress on some of the other issues and would love to know why
the Government did not feel able to meet us at least halfway on the
question of independent oversight.</p><p><a name="06110620000061"></a>There is one more area, about which I
hope the Minister will give me permission to ask. As the Minister in
another place stated this afternoon, there is to be a review of all
this. He assured Members that the review would examine whether the way
that the redress system works promotes that learning culture about
which we are all concerned; whether it reduces costs to the National
Health Service; and whether it deals properly with patient safety
issues. It would be good to know from the Minister when&#151;after
how long&#151;such a review of the redress system will take place.
Indeed, it would be excellent if he could tell us whether there would
be an independent element in such a review beyond the work that the
Healthcare Commission will be carrying out regularly in assessing
whether the scheme is operating properly.</p><p><a name="06110620000062"></a>With that, I thank the Minister for the
concessions that he has made and for the way in which he has dealt with
all the debates and discussions that we have had on this issue. I thank
the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for all the work that he has done with
colleagues in another place on the matter, all noble Lords who have
taken part in the debates and the many outside bodies that have made
representations to us all. I also thank the Bill team for all its work,
up to and including this morning.</p>

that it could be a better piece of legislation, but we will have to
wait to see how it works before we can judge. I look forward to taking
a close interest in the coming months and
years.</p><p><a name="06110620000064"></a><b><a name="61106-0007.htm_spnew117"></a><a name="06110620000121"></a>Baroness
Murphy:</b> My Lords, in adding my congratulations to
the Minister on what is essentially a good piece of work, I would like
to press him a little further on the meaning of Amendment No. 16A and
whether in regulations it would be possible to provide for that
independence that, when I first saw the amendment, I thought was being
introduced as a response to our previous amendments. Will he clarify
the extent of Amendment No. 16A? That would provide some
reassurance.</p><p><a name="06110620000065"></a><b><a name="61106-0007.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06110620000122"></a>Lord
Warner:</b> My Lords, I will do my best to respond to
the points made by noble Lords. The amendment to which we are asking
noble Lordsto agree is Amendment No. 16B, not
AmendmentNo. 16A. The amendment in lieu of the amendment made
in this House, which was passed earlier today in the other place,
specifically enables the scheme to provide for investigations to be
overseen by a person of a specified description. This amendment will
enable the scheme to specify the qualifications and experience that the
person who oversees the investigation by the scheme member at the local
level must have.</p><p><a name="06110620000066"></a>That will
benefit patients, who will now know who has overall responsibility for
the investigation into their case and who to contact about the
investigation. That is the purpose here. I hope that that gives some
reassurance to those on the Benches opposite and to the noble Baroness,
Lady Murphy, who have shown great persistence on the issues that they
have been pursuing. I commend them for their persistence, even if it
has on occasion been slightly uncomfortable to be on the receiving end
of it. I acknowledge that there were heartfelt views, and we have tried
to clarify the issue of oversight and the specification of the person
who might have it.</p><h5><a name="06110620000100"></a>6.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06110620000067"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Neuberger, asked me why we did not accept some of the proposals that
she and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, put forward. I do not want to go
over all that ground again, but there were issues about putting
proposals in the Bill when their workability could not be guaranteed. I
asked some relevant questions that need to be answered before we put
that kind of wording in the Bill. There would still be some issues to
be teased out if that approach were to be adopted. Essentially, the
problem was workability. We were also concerned that it could lead to
dual bureaucracy, and there was a largely unanswered question about who
would decide if the overseer and the investigator from two different
entities disagreed about what should be in the report. We did not
resolve that issue. The issues of the workability and credibility of
the scheme meant that it could not go in the Bill.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_638"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 638</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110620000068"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the
issue of privilege. I shall have another go. This is a complicated
area, and if I do not satisfy him, I am happy to have a discussion with
him afterwards and to write to him at greater length. The advice I have
been given is that a claim for privilege&#151;which is, in effect, to
prevent disclosure to another party&#151;can be made if a document is
a communication between a solicitor and a third party which arises
after litigation is contemplated and the purpose of which is to obtain
legal advice. Privilege cannot be claimed for an accident or
investigation report unless the sole or dominant purpose for which it
was prepared was for submission to a legal adviser for advice. If an
investigation report is prepared as a matter of course to find out the
cause of the accident and to avoid future occurrences, as is the case
in this legislation, and is to be provided to individuals, as is
envisaged under the redress scheme, it would not satisfy the test for
privilege. That is the legal advice that I have been given. I hand it
over to the noble Earl in a spirit of
helpfulness.</p><p><a name="06110620000069"></a>The noble Earl asked whether the
regulations could be looked at in draft. They will be subject to a
public consultation of three months, so there will be ample time for
the Benches opposite, and anybody else who wishes to, to examine them
in detail and to raise issues about them. I remind the House that the
regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure, so they will be
debated in both Houses.</p><p><a name="06110620000070"></a>We
indicated&#151;I think it was in Committee&#151;that there would be
a review of the scheme after three years. The precise way in which that
review will be conducted will be decided nearer the time. I think my
colleague in the other place, Andy Burnham, confirmed earlier today
that the review could cover areas that are troubling Members on the
Benches opposite. There will be an opportunity to look at this again
when reviewing the scheme at the end of that
period.</p><p><a name="06110620000071"></a>That is my best shot at
answering the points that were raised. I am happy to write in more
depth if noble Lords wish.</p><p><a name="06110620000072"></a>On

am pleased to introduce this debate, and to do so in the Moses Room. An
earlier report of the Economic Affairs Committee was the first
committee report to be reported here. It was a successful experiment
that has led the way for other committee reports to be debated in this
room. I should start with a confession rather than a declaration of
interest. The Minister, my noble friend from the Front Bench and I are
all members of the same professional body. In the past week, that body
has written to me to say that, as I have been paying the subscription
for such a long time, it now no longer wants me to pay it and has made
me a life member. It means that the Minister and my noble friend will
subsidise me until they reach an age when they have paid their
subscriptions for long enough to qualify for free membership. That is
not quite a declaration of interest, but noble Lords ought to know
that.</p><p><a name="06110624000011"></a>I have
one declaration of interest: as most noble Lords will know, I am the
convenor of the Lords and Commons Pipe and Cigar Smokers&#146; Club,
which means that I smoke three decent cigars a year, but not many more.
Lastly, I thank all the members of the committee for their collective
contribution to the report which, like all reports from the Economic
Affairs Committee, is evidence-based and entirely non party-political.
I thank also our specialist adviser, Professor Mike Jones-Lee, as well
as our Clerk and his excellent team. They have all given us a great
deal of
support.</p><p><a name="06110624000012"></a>In
our report we had many positive things to say about the
Government&#146;s approach to risk management. In particular, we felt
that the Government had succeeded in developing a sound and potentially
effective framework for the assessment of risk. However, we felt that
there were some important areas in which current guidelines are either
inadequate or are not applied appropriately. In addition, we were
concerned to find cases where the use of evidence was less than
rigorous in framing policy and in public statements by
Ministers.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110624000013"></a>I shall deal first with
matters of principle. Regarding the adequacy of existing guidelines, we
were concerned that the existing policy assessment procedures give
insufficient weight to the impact of legislation on personal freedoms.
Quite apart from the impact of any specific legislation, we were
particularly concerned that no consideration whatsoever is given to the
cumulative impact that successive legislation can have on personal
freedoms. Each small piece of legislation may on its own seem
reasonable, but when added together an environment is created in which
there are substantial restrictions on personal freedom of choice. Our
report quotes the views of the noble and learned Lord the Lord
Chancellor on this:</p><ul><a name="06110624000226"></a>&#147;I
think from time to time we do not focus on the cumulative impact. I
think we need to think how we could do this better and I think we need
to think how we look at the cumulative impact better than we do at the
moment&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000202"></a>The
committee felt that that was a sensible thing for the noble and learned
Lord to say at the time. We were encouraged by these comments and we
recommended that the Government introduce a formal procedure to
consider the potential impact of legislation on personal freedoms,
which would be quite distinct from the current procedure in which a
Minister merely certifies that legislation complies with the Human
Rights Act.<p><a name="06110624000014"></a>In contrast to the
comments of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, the
Government&#146;s response to our recommendations is, in our view,
both complacent and inadequate. While recognising that existing
procedures do not give proper consideration to the cumulative impact of
legislation on personal freedoms, the Government suggest that such
matters should not be part of policy-making and are best dealt with by
organisations such as the Law Society, which is concerned with the
overall coherence of the law, and the proposed Commission on Human
Rights and Equality, which apparently will be concerned with respect
for human rights and equality in society. Whatever the merits of these
bodies, the simple fact is that they are not designed to deal with
mattersof personal freedom of the kind with which the
committee was concerned. The case for establishing a formal assessment
procedure along the lines discussed in our report remains, in our view,
unanswered by the Government. Coherence and equality are not the same
as freedom, and it is quite possible to have a coherent set of laws
that oppress people in equal
measure.</p><p><a name="06110624000015"></a>Turning to more
specific matters, we expressed concern about the Government&#146;s
use of evidence in the context of both general policy statements by
Ministers and in the more detailed formulation of policy. Our report
highlighted instances in which policy statements appeared to be
motivated by media reports and unsubstantiated anecdotes rather than a
balanced consideration of the available evidence&#151;pronouncements
about developing a compensation culture and excessive risk aversion
among the public are clear examples. We examined each of those concerns
and found no evidence to support the view that British society had
become increasingly litigious or that people hold unreasonable views
about risk.</p>

to our comments reads as a retrospective justification of the attitudes
taken by Ministers in promoting particular policies rather than a
recognition of a simple point made in our report that policy decisions
should be soundly based on available evidence and not unduly influenced
by transitory or exaggerated opinions. To repeat what we said in our
report, it is important that the Government ensure that their own
handling of information and statistics is beyond
reproach.</p><p><a name="06110624000017"></a>The last point
concerning the use of statistics is particularly relevant in one of the
cases highlightedin our report: passive smoking. We took the
viewthat existing policy guidelines were not properly
implemented in this case and that the subsequent policy response
reflected in the Health Bill was disproportionate to the problem. We
were particularly concerned that the Government&#146;s use of
evidence did not conform with their own standards of good practice. The
evidence that we received, and other evidence available in the public
domain, clearly points to the fact that the health risks associated
with passive smoking are relatively minor and not sufficient on their
own to justify the legislation to restrict smoking in public places.
This is not to say that active smoking is not harmful or that policies
to restrict smoking are not a good thing. It simply means that a policy
to eliminate smoking in public places cannot rely on the argument that
the Government tried to make: that passive smoking poses a
major risk to public health.</p><p><a name="06110624000018"></a>In their response, the
Government reject our analysis of passive smoking and attempt to
undermine our conclusions by challenging the evidence in different
ways. They argue that the scientific and medical evidence of the health
risks presented by second-hand smoke is now well established and
clear.</p><p><a name="06110624000019"></a>[<I>The Sitting was

the fact that we received evidence from Imperial Tobacco and the

ignores, however, is the main part of the paragraph that I question. It
quotes evidence given by the Under-Secretary of State for Public
Health, who told the committee
that,</p><ul><a name="06110624000245"></a>&#147;it is clearly
the case that, in relation to deaths from smoking and second-hand
smoke, the most serious aspect of that is smoking in the home.
Ninety-five percent of the deaths come from smoking in the
home&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000023"></a>The
Government&#146;s response also quotesSir Richard
Peto&#146;s evidence to us
that:</p><ul><a name="06110624000228"></a>&#147;The definite
statement is that some people are killed by breathing other
people&#146;s smoke&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000205"></a>They fail to mention, however, that he
also told us
that,<ul><a name="06110624000246"></a>&#147;these risks
are small and difficult to measure
directly&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000024"></a>I stress
that our objective in raising the issue of passive smoking was not to
defend any kind of smoking, whether active or passive, or to say that
legislation is not needed to limit smoking in public places. Our
primary purpose was to emphasise a more general point: risk assessment
procedures and policy formulation should always be based on a clear
statement of objectives, an unbiased assessment of available evidence,
and a proper regard for the impact of legislation on personal freedom
and choice. Our view was that the legislation relating to passive
smoking failed to consider these matters properly and that the
Government should learn the appropriate lessons from their mistakes to
ensure that future policy responses are transparent,
evidence-basedand proportionate. Judging from the tone of the
Government&#146;s response to our comments on passive smoking, this
lesson has still to be
learnt.</p><p><a name="06110624000025"></a>Our report condemns the
use of ambiguous policy guidelines such as the precautionary principle
and ALARP&#151;that is, as low as reasonably practicable. The
Government response seeks to defend these as a useful part of policy
assessment procedures, used alongside other information and research.
However, the response does not really provide a defence for their use,
other than to say that they are widely used and useful in focusing
attention on factors that may be difficult to quantify. In our view,
this was a disappointingly lame and circular
argument.</p><p><a name="06110624000026"></a>By and large, we
thought that the Government had some very good policies on risk
management in general, but we felt that they did not always live up to
their own policies in
practice.</p><p><a name="06110624000027"></a>Moved, That the Grand

with road and railway accidents; the comparison between them and how
money is spent on them is important to
me.</p><p><a name="06110624000030"></a>First, in 2005 there were
3,201 road deaths. Against that, there were seven deaths on the
railways. There were 402,000 road accidents where claims were made.
Twelve per cent of all deaths&#151;about 250 on the
motorway&#151;occurred on the hard shoulder, awaiting assistance for
a breakdown. I find that
astonishing.</p><p><a name="06110624000031"></a>In accidents, the
role of the media impacts on Government. Frequently, they are anxious
to respond to exaggerated claims of government inadequacy. Paragraphs
98 and 99 of our report
state:</p><ul><a name="06110624000229"></a>&#147;Although we
share concerns about the potential impact of inaccurate media reports,
in practice there is little government can or should do to change the
way that the media report risk-related stories, other than to encourage
balance and proportionality in the reporting of statistics and
scientific research. Beyond that, the most important thing government
can do is to ensure that its own policy decisions are soundly based on
available evidence ... The evidence we took suggests that the
Government has at times given insufficient weight to available evidence
and placed too great a reliance on unsubstantiated reports that often
have their origin in the
media&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000206"></a>That is very
serious because it seems to control so many matters. The report
continues:<ul><a name="06110624000230"></a>&#147;In view of
this, it is important that the Government ensures that its own handling
of information and statistics is beyond reproach. We would also like to
see greater use of the Press Complaints Commission by interested
parties, including the Government, who feel that cases involving risks
to the public had been mis-reported or
mis-represented&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000032"></a>The
rate of deaths in the car was 2.7 per billion passenger kilometres,
while on the rail the figure was 0.4, so the incidence is between six
and seven times for car accidents. Professor John Broome, who is very
knowledgeable on these matters, said in evidence to the committee on 6
December last year:</p><ul><a name="06110624000231"></a>&#147;So
I think we can achieve a lot by looking at the railways and saying that
what the railways are spending is 20 times as much per life year as
what the health service is spending, say. That means we can save more
life years by taking money out of the railways and putting it into the
health service. You can get more life years just by doing
that&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000033"></a>How does that
compare with the statement that the Government will act proportionately
and consistently in dealing with risks to the public? They are not
acting proportionately. Road and rail are not treated proportionately
at all. On risk aversion, in paragraph 6 of our report, we
state</p><ul><a name="06110624000232"></a>&#147;Perceptions of
risk by the public clearly have a potentially important impact in a
policy environment that rightly aims to be responsive to public
concerns over safety. There is a danger, however, that excessive
risk-aversion on the part of the public may drive policy in an
unreasonably cautious direction, with disproportionate expenditure on
risk mitigation measures as well as non-financial costs. Part of the
job of government is of course to take account of public
concerns&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06110624000207"></a>as
it must, of
course&#151;<ul><a name="06110624000247"></a>&#147;but
it should also try to avoid any over-reaction to current concerns,
which may be
transitory&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000208"></a>That is
where the press and the media are involved in those
matters.

little evidence of a compensation culture&#151;an important aspect.
However, the Government, in their response, stated
that,</p><ul><a name="06110624000233"></a>&#147;the Better
Regulation Task
Force&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06110624000209"></a>which
examined these
matters&#151;<ul><a name="06110624000248"></a>&#147;found
that there was a perception that one did, and that this was having a
damaging influence on behaviour. In the work on tackling this
perception, Government does not consider that the policy is being
pushed in a risk-averse
direction&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000210"></a>The
Government&#146;s response is important because they go on to
say:<ul><a name="06110624000234"></a>&#147;Rather we are
driving policy in the opposite direction, so that people have a better
understanding of their rights and responsibilities and are encouraged
to adopt sensible and proportionate risk management procedures without
being excessively
risk-averse&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000035"></a>However,
the report requires a more thorough examination. My own feeling, which
largely comes from my period as a Member of Parliament, is that people
are now more willing to make claims than they used to be. This is a
continuing and serious aspect because there will be rather more claims
than there were before. The report is not quite so clear on this
matter; it states that there is some uncertainty about
it.</p><p><a name="06110624000036"></a>Paragraph 47 of the report
states:</p><ul><a name="06110624000235"></a>&#147;In some cases,
costs and benefits may be difficult or even impossible to measure,
particularly when the relative outcomes are ill defined or subject to
extreme
uncertainty&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000211"></a>One of
our major problems is that these things are difficult to define. The
report
continues:<ul><a name="06110624000236"></a>&#147;Problems
can also arise if attempts are made to incorporate certain kinds of
costs which are not readily amenable to monetary evaluation, such as
those associated with the loss of liberties arising from restrictive or
proscriptive
measures&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000212"></a>That is one
of the difficulties of assessing the costs and benefits of
accidents.<p><a name="06110624000037"></a>There is also a
major problem of valuing human life and the willingness to pay to
reduce the risk in certain circumstances. Paragraph 32 of the report
points out that it is difficult to find evidence that we are becoming a
more risk averse society. I agree that proof is difficult to find but,
again, my period as a Member of Parliament, when I discussed many such
issues with constituents, led me to believe that the fear of risk has
increased. The question we have to ask ourselves is: what have we done
to reduce the level of risk? As we see in the report, there is a need
for the greater use of the Press Complaints Commission because the
press exaggerates so many of these
matters.</p><p><a name="06110624000038"></a>We end the report by
highlighting the very important point
that:</p><ul><a name="06110624000237"></a>&#147;There has been a
significant move towards uniformity in the treatment of road and rail
safety&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000213"></a>That is much
needed. It is one of the most important parts of the report as it
concerns the relationship between road and rail safety. It continues
that,<ul><a name="06110624000249"></a>&#147;we would
encourage agencies working in other relevant areas, such as the
Department of Health, the NHS and NICE, to follow in the same
direction. However, the evidence suggests that road safety expenditure
is below the level that would be justified by current safety project
appraisal procedures and government action is needed to ensure that
transport safety expenditures are consistent between road and
rail&#148;.</ul>

Giddens:</b> I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Wakeham, and the committee on their report. I confess to having had a
little frisson of pleasure when I saw the report listed because I spent
a large chunk of my career studying risk and, for me, it is an
endlessly instructive subject. Traditional cultures did not have a
notion of risk&#151;they did not need it because they did not face
the future. If something happened, it could be blamed on the gods, the
spirits or simply fate. So the rise of the idea of risk was crucial to
the rise of our civilisation.</p><p><a name="06110624000040"></a>That is not as esoteric and
anthropological a point as it might sound. It means that risk, and
especially risk assessment, are crucial to security and safety. Many
people think of risk and security as opposites but they are not,
because the calculation of risk is crucial to nearly all the forms of
security and safety that we enjoy today. It has made the world a much
safer place, although, as I shall go on to say, there are many problems
in the world, from those involving health to those relating to the
buildings that we live in, and risk analysis is crucial to
security.</p><p><a name="06110624000041"></a>I agree with about 70
per cent of the report. I certainly agree that it does not make sense
to make sweeping generalisations about risk-averse society. I do not
see how one could possibly either measure or justify such statements.
It is always important to recognise that, like most areas of risk, risk
aversion is a very complex notion. For example, it is sometimes asked
why older people are afraid to go out on the streets at night, as it is
nearly always younger people who are beaten up or mugged. But that
neglects the fact that older people know that the streets are dangerous
and stay inside, and, to some extent, that is why they do not appear in
the statistics.</p><p><a name="06110624000042"></a>Risk aversion
is a complicated issue. Paradoxically, some of the most dangerous roads
are those with the lowest levels of traffic accidents because people
know that they are dangerous. Therefore, you certainly cannot
generalise about risk aversion in the way that the Prime Minister
seemed to do in his speech referred to in the opening part of the
report.</p><p><a name="06110624000043"></a>I am much less happy
with the conclusions drawn about passive smoking. I suppose that it
depends how you assess significant risk, but I think that here one is
talking about future risk. Passive smoking is likely to affect a large
number of young people. We do not really know what the true level of
risk will be, but the findings suggest that comparatively it is
significant and that therefore it is not accidental that in places
ranging from many states in the United States to the most improbable
countries, such as Italy and France, with well established smoking
cultures, smoking has been banned in public places. Many countries have
done so, and I do not think that is because they did

you decide is significant risk, but I would say that the policy is
justified.</p><p><a name="06110624000044"></a>[<I>The Sitting was

Giddens:</b> Perhaps the committee made a conscious
judgment not to say more on large-scale risks, but I would have liked
it to do so. The management of such risks is different from those on
which the report concentrates. The report talks about drivers and car
accidents on page 6, and rightly says that every time someone gets into
a car you cannot tell what will happen to that individual, but you can
assess the risk that they will be involved in an accident or suffer
injury or death. You cannot do that with most large-scale risks, which
is why they are different. The Government face fundamental problems
with them, for reasons I will come to.</p><p><a name="06110624000046"></a>The report refers to some large-scale
risks but, unless I missed it, the theme does not seem to be developed.
Nuclear power, avian flu, CJD and international terrorism are
mentioned. These are all low-probability, high-consequence risks, with
a different dynamic from the sort of risks on which the main body of
the report concentrates. I do not, however, see how one can discuss
risk management while excluding them.</p><p><a name="06110624000047"></a>Large-scale risks are more important than
they used to be, for two main reasons. First, the impact of
globalisation: there are now more global risks, with larger
consequences for society. Secondly, the impact of technology: as
technology penetrates nature more and more, so there is less and less
left of what nature used to be, and many new risks open up. Of course,
there are many opportunities too. Manifestly, climate change brings
those two things together.</p><p><a name="06110624000048"></a>I
shall say a bit about these risks and why they pose big problems for
the Government to manage. In the case of large-scale risks, the true
level of risk is not known. That is why you cannot calculate it in an
actuarial way, as with the risks that insurance companies insure
against. One should remember that the welfare state is essentially a
collective insurance system and depends upon the assessment of that
type of risk. However, you cannot do that with large-scale risks that
feature unknowns. That is why there is so much controversy about them,
and why it is so difficult for Governments to know what to do about
them. There is a certain Left/Right division built around the issue,
because Right-wingers tend to be suspicious about the risks claimed to
come from climate change, whereas Left-wingers tend to be suspicious of
the risks associated with international terrorism. In both cases,
though, the risks are hypothetical. You cannot know in advance exactly
what they will be, and, in the case of climate change, science will not
provide a complete answer.</p>

<p><a name="06110624000049"></a>The
nature of these risks means that you cannot afford to get it wrong even
once. That is why they are so different from the other types of risk.
People might say, for example, that the risk of international terrorism
is exaggerated, but you need only one major example of really
large-scale terrorism for the fact 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that one has got it wrong to have destroyed most of the assumptions on
which one was proceeding. You only need something relatively minor,
like a dirty bomb in the centre of London, which would not kill many
people but would produce mass panic. A dirty bomb is fairly easily
built, but of course there are terrorists who have much more
destructive ambitions than that. It might never happen, but if it does,
it will be too late.</p><p><a name="06110624000050"></a>As a result,
large-scale risks are difficult for Governments to manage. You must
invest quite a lot, for example, if you want to control the risk of
avian flu, which, in my judgment, is a real risk for all of us. As we
know, if you look at the 1918-19 flu epidemic, in which 50 million
across the world died, the consequences are very damaging. Forty per
cent of the population might be infected at any time, with 3 per cent
of the population dying, most of them younger people, not older. You
must invest to combat such risks, but it might turn out not to be a
risk at all. You cannot predict whether avian flu will jump species to
humans. If it does, we are in big trouble. If not, there was not much
of a risk after all, but then people will say, &#147;Scaremongering!
Why were you trying to scare us? Look, it is just like SARS. Everyone
was making a fuss about SARS, but it didn&#146;t turn out to be
anything&#148;. But that is generic to managing these kinds of
risks.</p><p><a name="06110624000051"></a>Moreover, the things you
do might cause the event not to happen, and people will still blame you
for exaggerating the risk. Let us say that international terrorism is a
real threat to us, which I think it is. Many proscriptions, changes in
the law and so forth are introduced, but if an episode of international
terrorism of any significance does not then happen in this country,
people will say you were simply producing the politics of fear. That is
the dilemma, and there is no simple way out for Government in managing
such things.</p><p><a name="06110624000052"></a>There is another,
residual problem: risk fatigue. How many serious risks do you alert
people to, and how do you get them to keep those risks in their mind
without saying, &#147;Oh well, there&#146;s nothing much that I can
do about it&#148;? It is a difficult issue; I can think of seven,
eight or nine really serious risks that we face in this era of
globalisation and high technology. I cannot see how citizens could keep
all these things in mind, so Government must do it for them, but that
is quite difficult. You need people to keep things in mind, because
often you need them to take action against those risks. That is why,
for example, when people got scared about AIDS, its incidence was
reduced. You have to scare people to get them to react, but if nothing
happens you will be accused of scaremongering.</p><p><a name="06110624000053"></a>The policy guidelines, such as openness
and transparency, on page nine of the report are relevant. I agree with
the committee&#146;s conclusion that the Government have devoted a
lot of attention to risk management and taken it seriously&#151;for
example, the policy unit had a major programme on it. However, I do not
think that those criteria are enough to deal with low-probability,
high-consequence risks. Three things must be done, and I am not sure to
what extent the Government have done them.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110624000054"></a>First,
you must have in place catastrophe management processes. Although
catastrophes have different origins, they often have similar
consequences, for example mass panic. You can have mobile, well trained
teams to respond to catastrophes; they could have a similar brief for
different forms of catastrophe. I am not sure whether such units exist
here, but they prove very effective, often in less developed
countries.</p><p><a name="06110624000055"></a>Secondly, it must be
accepted that there will be trade-offs with civil liberties in certain
core areas, and terrorism is clearly one such area. The House of Lords
did a good job in producing a sensible outcome on those lines. We
cannot suppose that people could be arraigned by traditional processes
when there are some who might do deadly danger and are part of an
international network. The police would need time to trace that
network. The capability to hold people for longer, where a judge has
the right to see the evidence, seems a sensible compromise. There will
be trade-offs with traditional civil liberties when trying to manage
high-consequence risks.</p><p><a name="06110624000056"></a>Thirdly, we need a more
intense national discussion about vulnerabilities, and I am not sure to
what extent we have done that. What did the fuel crisis of a few years
ago teach us? That we are only about a week away from national
starvation because supermarkets now operate on a &#147;just in
time&#148; basis; they do not store food like they used to, so the
action of a few truck drivers blocking a few petrol stations imperilled
the food supply of the nation. We have learnt from that, but there are
many other vulnerabilities in a heavily interconnected society,
especially a globalised one. I am very impressed with the plan that the
state of California has drawn up about its vulnerabilities; as a nation
we should do the same.</p><p><a name="06110624000057"></a>I do not
know how much of this work has been done, so perhaps the Minister will
tell us what the Government have in place.</p><h5><a name="06110624000259"></a>4.28

responsible for better regulation between 2001 and 2003. In addition, I
was the Minister for Transport between 1999 and 2001, a period when,
sadly, a succession of rail accidents made the management of risk on
public transport a matter of high political priority. My noble friend
Lord Sheldon made some very telling points about risk on public
transport which I want to labour further. As a member of your
Lordships&#146; Select Committee on Economic Affairs, I pay tribute
to our chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, our Clerk and the
distinguished advisers. They marshalled some very complex evidence and
a great mass of information, pointing us towards constructive and, I
hope, useful conclusions.</p><p><a name="06110624000059"></a>During my time in
Government I was involved in a number of initiatives to improve risk
management; therefore, I welcome the committee&#146;s first
conclusion that the Government take risk management seriously. I also
agree with the view that we reported from within Whitehall that the
current guidelines are appropriate and that the framework of risk
management in the UK now compares favourably with the best practice
found elsewhere in the world.</p>

the priority the Prime Minister gives to the need for better regulation
and an informed, robust approach to risk. During my time working
directly to the Prime Minister, I encouraged the Better Regulation Task
Force to investigate the concerns about the supposed growth of a
compensation culture in the UK. The task force reported that the
evidence contradicted the anecdotage, amplified in the media, to create
the now widespread belief that demands for compensation were increasing
inexorably and were also increasingly absurd.</p><p><a name="06110624000061"></a>Echoing those Better Regulation Task
Force conclusions mentioned by my noble friend Lord Sheldon, our
committee concluded that, since then, the Government have at times
given insufficient weight to available evidence and that use of
evidence has been insufficiently
rigorous.</p><p><a name="06110624000062"></a>Our
witnesses were clear in stating that pronouncements were often based on
anecdotal media stories. We concluded, therefore, that the formulation
of policy clearly requires more thorough and responsible assessment of
evidence. I will not repeat the detailed points made by the noble Lord,
Lord Wakeham. However, evidence presented to the committee indicated
that compensation claims for clinical negligence, employer liability,
public liability, and so on, were actually in decline. In general, that
may be true, but one reads only today that tribunal claims brought by
staff against employers went up significantly in the last financial
year, despite legislation in 2004 designed to reduce claims. Trade
unions and businesses have welcomed today&#146;s news that the DTI
will review the new rules, which appear to be too complex and seem to
be exploited by &#147;no win, no fee&#148;
lawyers.</p><p><a name="06110624000063"></a>In reporting problems
of this kind, the media could make our conclusions seem
counterintuitive. Indeed, the popular impression is so strongly held
that I believe the Government should continue to assemble evidence and
test alternative explanations on a scale beyond the resources of our
committee to persuade us that our fears are largely
unfounded.</p><p><a name="06110624000064"></a>Related to the fear
of the so-called compensation culture is the growth of risk
aversion&#151;again, an allegation pursued with almost ideological
zeal by sections of the media, often conflated with now rather
ritualised accusations of political correctness. But, yet again, we
could find no clear evidence to justify this widely held view that
Britain has become increasingly risk-averse. Nevertheless, I agree with
the concern expressed by my noble and learned friend the Lord
Chancellor and the Minister for health and safety, my noble friend Lord
Hunt, that misperceptions about the threat of compensation claims may
have made public sector managers more risk-averse. As Sir Brian Bender,
a Permanent Secretary at the peak of the Civil Service, warned, fear of
failure affecting promotion prospects could indeed make policy-makers
in Whitehall overly
risk-averse.</p><p><a name="06110624000065"></a>It is worth
recalling that our committee&#146;s inquiry was initially promoted in
part by the Prime Minister&#146;s suggestion last year
that,</p><ul><a name="06110624000250"></a>&#147;we are in
danger of having a disproportionate attitude to the risks we should
expect to run as a normal part of life&#148;.</ul>

Minister responsible for better regulation, we battled constantly at
the centre of Government to reduce so-called red tape. That, too, is an
area beset by anecdote; it is sometimes surprisingly short of hard
evidence when you ask the complainants for the specifics of the problem
so that you can tackle it. But the Prime Minister was personally
passionate about stripping out redundant rules, insisting that new
legislation was subject to rigorous regulatory impact assessments,
ending the gold-plating of transposed European directives and
strengthening the independence and influence of the Better Regulation
Task Force and Better Regulation Executive to embolden the culture of
the public sector towards the sensible management of risks. I trust,
too, that your Lordships&#146; Economic Affairs Committee in its
report on risk management will assist the next Prime Minister to
continue Mr Blair&#146;s campaign for a more robust attitude to
compensation claims, red tape and
risk-aversion.<p><a name="06110624000066"></a>My noble friend
Lord Giddens talked about the low-probability, high-consequence events.
Again, I have some ministerial experience of this, having been Minister
of Transport during the fuel crisis in 2000. My noble friend is right
that society is much more vulnerable than most people had assumed. Some
sections of the media had an almost larky approach to the whole event.
However, in a just-in-time society one could see vulnerabilities and
interdependencies that had not been fully appreciated. I
believe&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm this&#151;that a
great deal of work has been undertaken since then.</p><p><a name="06110624000067"></a>I also agree with the
concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Giddens about epidemics and
threats of terrorism, and the financial risks and so on. In the Cabinet
Office, I was responsible for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, and
we started a great deal of work in this area. My noble friend mentioned
the threat of a dirty bomb. Since my years in Government, and with what
is now established science relating to monitoring the effects of
radioactivity, it should have become possible to give much more
information to the population about the possible effects of released
radioactivity and the great length of time that it may take before
there is any serious consequence for perhaps only a small minority of
people. Giving more information to the public would help to control the
panic that my noble friend rightly fears and it would also help with
catastrophe management.</p><p><a name="06110624000068"></a>Although our efforts in
the Economic Affairs Committee were modest, we assembled a base of
evidence and made a case for strengthening that with impartial,
statistically sound evidence based on cost and risk. The Government
should continue to make that a priority. They should also pursue areas
of larger risk which are less amenable to statistical analysis. As my
noble friend Lord Giddens rightly said, that should be at the top of
the Government&#146;s agenda.</p><h5><a name="06110624000260"></a>4.37

and the committee on an excellent report. I only regret that it is not
being debated on the Floor of the House. Risk management is an
important and ever-present issue, and its misuse can cause difficulties
and hardship.</p><p><a name="06110624000070"></a>Chapter 5 of the
report contains passages on passive smoking. I regret the cavalier
treatment by Government of a serious and responsible report and the
insult to distinguished members of the Select Committee who prepared
the report and to those who gave evidence to it, during the debates on
the clauses of the Health Bill 2006 that banned smoking in workplaces
and enclosed public places. I very much regret the attitude that
Ministers took at that stage. The evidence of Sir Richard Peto was
ignored and slighted and, as the chairman pointed out in his opening
remarks, even the evidence given by Caroline Flint, the then
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for public
health, that 95 per cent of deaths from passive smoking related to
smoking in the home was sidelined and not taken properly into
account.</p><p><a name="06110624000071"></a>Had
the Government treated this report with proper respect and
understanding, the disproportionate response referred to in paragraph
84 could have been avoided. Instead, Ministers allowed themselves to be
swept along by the anti-smoking and highly subsidised zealots of ASH
and by the highly questionable statistical evidence provided by the
medical and scientific community to impose a cruel and unnecessary ban
on smoking in workplaces and enclosed public places. The ban is even
now being extended to open-air spaces and, under some circumstances,
inside the home.</p><p><a name="06110624000072"></a>As the report
points out, the Health and Safety Executive simply took the word of the
Chief Medical Officer that such a ban was necessary, instead of
undertaking proper research into the veracity of all the claims made by
the anti-smoking lobby and properly evaluating alternatives such as
separation and efficient ventilation, about which a great deal of
evidence was provided to the committee on the Bill. It should also have
examined whether the bans would be proportionate and not undermine
individual freedoms. Had it done so, it might have noticed that the
medical profession, which exerted extreme pressure for the smoking ban,
is reported as being responsible for at least 5,000 deaths a year
through medical negligence and lack of personal hygiene. That is far
more deaths than are alleged to be caused through so-called passive
smoking.</p><p><a name="06110624000073"></a>Finally, while I
welcome the report, I hope that the Select Committee does not see it as
a one-off investigation and that it will undertake further periodic
reviews. Risk cannot be entirely eliminated in society and we should
not allow overzealous officials and technocrats to turn our country
into one so fearful of any risk that it will accept any curtailment of
individual liberty imposed upon it by
Government.</p><h5><a name="06110624000261"></a>4.41

who has certainly thrown a new light on to risk-taking for me. However,
paragraph 84 of the report is disturbing at best and a travesty at
worst, especially when talking about passive smoking and its impact. It
states:</p><ul><a name="06110624000238"></a>&#147;In particular,
the purpose of legislation should have been defined more clearly and
greater attention should have been given to available scientific
evidence, the relative merits of alternative policy options and the
impact of legislation on personal freedom and
choice&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000216"></a>We had hours
of considering such evidence and similar debate during the passage of
the Health Bill through the House, as I am sure noble Lords will
remember. I find that paragraph disturbing and I fear that the
committee has allowed itself to become one-sided on the issue of the
impact of passive
smoking.<p><a name="06110624000075"></a>Although the noble
Lord, Lord Stoddart, may not agree with it, the Government, in their
response at paragraph 25, make the point very clearly by stating
that,</p><ul><a name="06110624000251"></a>&#147;no evidence was
taken by the Committee from any of the key medical bodies such as the
Royal College of Physician or the British Medical Association nor from
the key health charities such as Cancer Research UK or the British
Heart Foundation who could have provided the Committee with
clarification of the health risks of second hand
smoke&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000217"></a>The
government response also reflects a concern that the available evidence
was not set out in the report. Paragraph 24
states:<ul><a name="06110624000239"></a>&#147;The
scientific and medical evidence of the health risk presented by second
hand smoke is now well established and
clear&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000218"></a>It is left at
that. But, again, the point is made that there is evidence from
overseas as well as the
UK:<ul><a name="06110624000240"></a>&#147;Authoritative
bodies around the world and in the UK, including the World Health
Organisation, the Royal College of Physicians and the British Medical
Association, agree on the
risks&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000219"></a>This really is
a problem, and attention has to be drawn to it. Finally, the Government
state at paragraph
29:<ul><a name="06110624000241"></a>&#147;Contrary to the
statements made in the Committee&#146;s report, throughout this
process there was extensive private, public and political debate on the
most appropriate policy response to the hazards of second hand
smoke&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000076"></a>In my view, it
is a shame that the committee&#146;s handling of this issue has
detracted from an otherwise good
report.</p><p><a name="06110624000077"></a>[<I>The Sitting was

interest in the subject, so when I first discovered that I had been
selected to speak I thought that this must be one of the driest
subjects that I had ever had to consider in my time in the House of
Lords. However, as the debate today has shown, you need to spend only
five minutes thinking about the subject to realise that it lies at the
heart of a large proportion of public-policy decisions, large and
small.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110624000079"></a>As I was thinking
about the debate during the course of last week, two reports made that
point absolutely: first, the Stern report and then the report about the
collapse in fish stocks. Both those reports state that, if we continue
with business as usual, there is a significant risk that our actions
now will incur costs in future many times that of the short-term cost
of changing our behaviour
today.</p><p><a name="06110624000080"></a>Both reports have led to
heated arguments which boil down to disagreement about risk. In the
case of the Stern report, Sir Nicholas was attacked, on one side, by a
prominent academic as being alarmist and incompetent and, on the other,
by an equally accomplished academic as grossly underestimating the cost
of changing our lifestyle if we are to reduce carbon emissions to a
sustainable level.</p><p><a name="06110624000081"></a>How, then,
can we be sure that we assess risk correctly? That is the burden of the
report. I found an extremely useful description of the tools used by
the Government in this area. I was unaware of the extent to which there
are formal Treasury guidelines dealing with the issue so
comprehensively. While not wanting to throw out the baby with the
bathwater, I share the report&#146;s conclusions that some techniques
used can give a spurious certainty to the degree of risk or can induce
an excessively cautious attitude to
it.</p><p><a name="06110624000082"></a>How far is
the cautious view of risk in government attributable to the fact that
those assessing the risk are themselves excessively risk-averse? Sir
Brian Bender's evidence on the mindset of civil servants was
compelling, from my limited experience as a civil servant. I found
compelling his point that a civil servant who took the risk of being
wrong one time in 10 would soon find that he had reached the pinnacle
of his career. There are few more damning judgments on a civil servant
than that he or she is not a safe pair of hands. Not making mistakes is
the first art of bureaucratic survival. That is crucial in how the
Government start to assess
risk.</p><p><a name="06110624000083"></a>If the mindset of civil
servants is to err on the side of caution, how is that to be
counterbalanced? In part, one can have people like Sir Nick Stern, who
is not a career civil servant, in effect, doing a civil
servant&#146;s job but, in the run of things, that counterbalance
must be provided by politicians, who must be prepared to take some risk
themselves.</p><p><a name="06110624000084"></a>Here,
the report highlights the real issue, which is how the media deal with
risk. The media are habitually alarmist, because that sells papers, but
they are also virtually untouchable. The report suggests that more
recourse be handed to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), but the
commission's code of conduct is regularly breached with, it seems to
me, almost total impunity.</p><p><a name="06110624000085"></a>Let
us take, for example, the reference to GM crops as &#147;Frankenstein
foods&#148;. Whatever one&#146;s view of GM crops, this was a
ridiculously disproportionate description of the risks. It breached all
the sections of the code set out in the report and yet, unless I am
very much mistaken, there were no complaints to the
PCC.</p><p><a name="06110624000086"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0002.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06110624000279"></a>Lord
Wakeham:</b> As I spent seven and a
half years as the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, I should
say to the noble Lord that the commission is simply not allowed under
its constitution to act unless

want to make a complaint. I do not have the details of the case he
mentions, but many of the criticisms made of the body which I chaired
for many years come down to the fundamental fact that it cannot deal
with anything unless someone complains. If you want to know the reason
for that, you should look at the fate of the former Press
Council.</p><p><a name="06110624000087"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0002.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06110624000280"></a>Lord
Newby:</b> Going back a
step, why do people not make complaints? I regularly read things in the
papers that incense me. Why have I never even contemplated going to the
Press Complaints Commission? The answer is, frankly, I believe&#151;I
may be completely wrong&#151;that my chances of securing any
effective redress on a complaint about a news story which gives a
disproportionately alarmist headline, on a matter of science or
anything else, are small. Perhaps the Government and the Press
Complaints Commission between them can play a role in persuading people
like me that that is not the case. Even if the PCC does have that power
in theory, it cannot be exercised because of people&#146;s
perceptions of it at the moment. In many cases people will not go to
the PCC.</p><p><a name="06110624000088"></a>The report states that
it was unable to find any significant evidence to suggest that we have
become a more risk-averse society. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said
it might be virtually impossible to decide. I think on a small scale,
in some areas, there is some evidence that we are becoming more risk
averse. The example that people always give, and which I shall give
today, is health and safety legislation. The report refers to anecdotal
evidence. There is no systematic evidence but everyone you speak to can
give you anecdotal evidence. My anecdotes over the past year in that
narrow area are as
follows.</p><p><a name="06110624000089"></a>First, I have recently
been decanted from my office so that a space of two feet can be sliced
off it to marginally widen a corridor which has existed for many years.
Suddenly it had been determined that this corridor was a health risk in
the unlikely event of the building in which I reside catching fire.
Secondly, I am involved vicariously with the local fair in Vauxhall
park, where two relatively new health and safety requirements reflect a
disproportionate view of risk. The first is the well known example that
if you are selling cakes at a fair these days you cannot place them on
a table and sell them with a cup of tea to someone. Each piece of cake
must be wrapped in cling film because of the risk of having the whole
cake open to the elements. An example that I would particularly like if
it were not so pathetic is the requirement for an annual written risk
assessment of the likelihood of a child drowning in one of the games we
have at Vauxhall fair, which involves hooking a little rubber duck from
a pool of water no more than four inches deep. This risk assessment
must be written and formally reviewed every year, and the organisers of
the fair must demonstrate to the very efficient Lambeth health and
safety person who comes round every year that that procedure has been
carried out. Such procedures do not necessarily translate throughout
society but they are examples where we have become more risk averse and
of a complete lack of proportionality.</p>

report refers to the smoking ban and the disproportionate cost of
dealing with passive smoking. This issue reveals a number of real
problems with reaching a dispassionate decision on virtually any area
of public policy. I voted enthusiastically for the ban. This had
nothing to do with passive smoking but with the fact that both my sons
learnt to smoke in a pub. On a rather unfortunate occasion I found one
of them smoking in a pub when he had been at great pains to disguise
his habit from me. But my thinking about that issue was absolutely
coloured by my own personal experience, and no amount of evidence about
passive smoking, one way or the other, was going to take away my
absolute determination to vote in the way I did. That demonstrates some
of the problems involved in these issues. The costs and risks involved
in the hunting ban were debated but discussed very dispassionately by
the noble Lord, Lord Burns, in his report. Large swathes of evidence
were, in effect, washed away by people&#146;s own views, born out of
their own conflicting experiences.</p><p><a name="06110624000091"></a>Having read the
material and thought about it for the first time, the single conclusion
I have reached reflects the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Giddens.
Given that society faces vulnerabilities, large and small, the only way
of resolving them is by having a more intensive discussion on them
based on firm evidence. Given that the Stern report deals with,
arguably, the most important long-term risk that humanity faces, it
would be a good idea for your Lordships&#146; committee, from time to
time over the coming years, to review its progress using some of the
tools and disciplines that we have discussed in this
debate.</p><h5><a name="06110624000263"></a>5.07

friend and his committee that they have volunteered to tackle such a
complex issue as risk management. They have not shied away from
controversial aspects&#151;for example, passive smoking, on which a
number of noble Lords have commented. I shall not add to that debate;
nor shall I comment on the bigger issues that were raised in the
interesting speech of the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, because I simply do
not have his level of expertise.</p><p><a name="06110624000094"></a>Coming from the private sector, I thought
I knew quite a lot about risk management. Nowadays on boards we have
processes which look at risk, evaluate it, see how it can be mitigated,
what the costs of mitigation are and decide which risks should be borne
and managed. The important point is that in the private sector it is a
matter of bearing and managing risk rather than avoiding or eliminating
risk. I was struck by the CBI&#146;s evidence to the committee that
there are different cultural approaches to risk, with the public sector
being &#147;constitutionally risk averse&#148; and the private
sector having risk as its <I>raison d&#146;être</I>.<I></I>I
do not believe that either of those statements is100 per cent
accurate but there is a fundamental

when risk crosses the boundary from the public sector to the private
sector&#151;it often does so, notably in the area of
regulation.</p><p><a name="06110624000095"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0003.htm_spnew131"></a><a name="06110624000282"></a>Lord
Giddens:</b> I feel I must comment on that because
some of the biggest risks are taken in public sector projects. Massive
projects are set up without proper risk assessment&#151;for example,
building bridges and all kinds of major projects. Someone wrote a
really good book on this which showed that nearly all such projects go
wrong and overrun their budget by a tremendous amount; they are
essentially status projects rather than anything else. But these kinds
of projects are particularly associated with the state sector rather
than the private sector. That is why one should be careful about making
any wild
generalisations.</p><p><a name="06110624000096"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0003.htm_spnew132"></a><a name="06110624000283"></a>Baroness
Noakes:</b> That is an extremely important point. The
noble Lord describes situations in which risk is consciously not
managed in the public sector because of some overriding political
desire to carry out a particular project. There is probably another
category of activity in the public sector where conventional approaches
to risk management are simply not addressed, or are addressed in a way
that gives the appearance of complying with the various guidelines on
risk management when, underneath, the risk is not managed at
all.</p><p><a name="06110624000097"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0003.htm_spnew133"></a><a name="06110624000284"></a>Lord
Giddens:</b> Forgive me, but I am not sure about that
either. The failure of Enron was based on the miscalculation of risk,
so one would be hard put to say that the public sector manages risk
less effectively than the private sector. It would be hard to
generalise about it too easily. I shall not disturb the noble Baroness
any
further.</p><p><a name="06110624000098"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0003.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06110624000285"></a>Baroness
Noakes:</b> I am not saying that the public sector
manages risk better or worse than the private sector. My point was that
the private sector goes out of its way to identify the risks that it
will manage, because that is at the heart of wealth creation, whereas,
in the public sector, the Government's approach is often to try to
eliminate or avoid risk, or reduce it to a very low level by using
things such as the ALARP measurement. They may not always succeed but,
often, government policy is designed to eliminate rather than face and
manage risk. Perhaps the noble Lord and I will not agree on that and we
can debate it another time.</p><p><a name="06110624000099"></a>The
committee rightly drew attention to the predisposition to risk
aversion&#151;I think that that is uncontroversial&#151;in the
public sector. In paragraph 8 of its report, it states that there
is,</p><ul><a name="06110624000252"></a>&#147;a possible need
for greater awareness of the consequences of the assessment and
incentive systems that operate in the public
sector&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000220"></a>I have
puzzled about that recommendation. Why is there just a possible need to
consider those matters? Surely it is self-evident that, as a minimum,
there should be greater awareness of the consequences of the assessment
and incentive systems.

&#147;awareness&#148;&#151;the word used by the
committee&#151;sufficient? In their slightly smug response, the
Government say in paragraph 3 that they
are,</p><ul><a name="06110624000253"></a>&#147;fully aware of
the pressures that drive risk
policy&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000221"></a>The
Government believe that the Better Regulation Executive, plus a new
compliance code for regulators, will solve any existing problems. That
is the substance of their official
response.<p><a name="06110624000101"></a>The better
regulation efforts of the Government, although entirely worthy in their
aims, have had relatively little impact to date in changing the mindset
of regulators. I am cynical about the effect that yet another
pronouncement or code will have on cultural attitudes to
risk.</p><p><a name="06110624000102"></a>I think that the report
pulled its punches in that area and allowed the Government to get away
with a slightly bland response. I ask the Minister today whether more
doses of better regulation, wrapped up in a new compliance code, will
change culture and practice. How do the Government propose to monitor
the effectiveness of those policy responses; that is, better regulation
and a code? Will he also say categorically whether the Government
believe that any cultural change is desirable, as paragraphs 1 to 3 of
their response are ambiguous? If some change is desirable, how will the
Government measure the outcome of their
policies?</p><p><a name="06110624000103"></a>Much
of the new regulation passed each year emanates from Europe&#151;at
least half, I believe. European attitudes to risk may be different from
ours, and there is also the danger that Europe-wide policy may require
this country to regulate for risks that are non-existent or minimal in
this country or are already perfectly well managed by non-regulatory
approaches. Financial services and accounting, with which I am
familiar, certainly contain examples of that, but I am sure that there
are other areas. I am slightly disappointed that the committee did not
include any of this in its report, and I hope that it was not because
of some boundary dispute between my noble friend&#146;s Economic
Affairs Committee and the European Union
Committee.</p><p><a name="06110624000104"></a>Staying
with the international dimension, another area which the committee
seems not to have addressed is whether how regulators approach risk
management in practice results in a competitive disadvantage for the
UK. In the volume setting out the evidence, I saw that the noble Lord,
Lord Powell of Bayswater, put this question to the chairman of the
Health and Safety Commission, but the chairman&#146;s response was
predicated on the executive having the right approach. He thus failed
to address the question: he could not see beyond how the HSC actually
operates.</p><p><a name="06110624000105"></a>I
certainly do not advocate a race to the bottom in public protection in
the name of competitive advantage, but there are legitimate questions
to be asked about the degree to which regulation impacts on the
UK&#146;s competitive position, especially as we have been dropping
down the competitiveness league tables for several years. Furthermore,
since one of the drivers of regulatory responses is the attitude to
risk management, it is an appropriate area for investigation. My noble
friend

topics for a follow-up study on risk management, should his committee
ever run out of things to
investigate.</p><p><a name="06110624000106"></a>I want to touch on
the trade-off between regulation and liberty, addressed by the report
in Chapter 3. Paragraph 29
recommends:</p><ul><a name="06110624000242"></a>&#147;A more
formal procedure through which the potential impact of legislation on
personal freedoms is
considered&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000222"></a>Earlier
the paragraph states
that,<ul><a name="06110624000254"></a>&#147;greater
account should be taken of the specific and cumulative impact of
legislation on personal
freedoms&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000223"></a>Those are
very important recommendations, and I was disappointed with the
Government&#146;s response at paragraph 8, saying that consideration
of the cumulative impact
is,<ul><a name="06110624000255"></a>&#147;often best
undertaken at a remove from the policy-making machinery of
government&#148;.</ul><a name="06110624000224"></a>That
statement shows that the Government do not even try to make joined-up
government work. That is a pretty dreadful
admission.<p><a name="06110624000107"></a>The Government say
that the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will somehow fill
the void, but with the best will in the world, a body which is taking
over the various equality agendas will struggle to have an impact on
something as broad as the cumulative impact of legislation on civil
liberties. It is not right in principle that the Government should be
able to wash their hands of responsibility in this
way.</p><p><a name="06110624000108"></a>Over the
past couple of weeks, the spotlight has been on areas where civil
liberties are under attack. Last week, the Information Commissioner
warned about the dangers of the surveillance society and the fact that
the police national DNA database is rapidly accumulating DNA samples
without any proper debate. During the summer, there were reports that a
secret committee of Ministers was recommending that all information
held about individuals throughout government should be capable of being
shared without the protection of individual information gateways. The
Big Brother national identity database, which hid behind the identity
card proposals, is another example of the encroachment of the state on
the freedoms of the
individual.</p><p><a name="06110624000109"></a>The
Government&#146;s response rejects the idea that regulatory impact
assessments should cover the impact on personal freedoms. Ministers
sign the Human Rights Act declarations on Bills, but in doing so deal
only with the impact of a particular Bill and not more widely. I cannot
accept that the Government should be allowed to approach civil
liberties in this narrow way and I hope that they are prepared to look
again at
this.</p><p><a name="06110624000110"></a>The
report covers many more aspects of risk and government policy. It is
both thoughtful and thought-provoking, and I could spend much of the
afternoon talking about it. However, I must resist the temptation to
delve into the calculations which have been touched on this afternoon.
I hope that the Government will take more of the report&#146;s
substance to heart than their official response would have us
believe.</p>

McKenzie of Luton:</b> I add my thanks to the noble
Lord, Lord Wakeham, for introducing the report and to all those who
have participated in today&#146;s excellent debate. The Government
welcome the report of the Economic Affairs Committee on government
policy on the management of risk, which has helped inform the current
debate about the management of risk in government and in our society.
We welcome the committee&#146;s conclusion that the evidence
presented to it suggests that the Government take risk policy
seriously, which was confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham; and
indeed we do.</p><p><a name="06110624000112"></a>Risk is defined as
an uncertainty of outcome, whether positive opportunity or negative
threat, of actions and events. Risk management includes identifying and
assessing risks and then responding to them.</p><p><a name="06110624000113"></a>As a nation, we face significant
challenges in the short and longer term. We have to develop the right
systems and culture that will enable Government to respond effectively
to the risks that those challenges present. There are several types of
risk in the business of government: policy or strategic risk; financial
risk; risk to the public or groups of stakeholders; project/delivery
failure; and reputational risk. Increasingly, Government recognise the
need for an understanding of risk to be at the heart of policy and
decision-making and not something to consider once policy is
developed.</p><p><a name="06110624000114"></a>For the past four
years, a risk programme has been run by the Government, initiated after
a review by the Prime Minister&#146;s Strategy Unit and assisted by
National Audit Office work on the Government&#146;s management of
risk. As part of that programme, the Treasury has monitored progress on
departments&#146; capacity to manage risk, and significant progress
has been made.</p><p><a name="06110624000115"></a>Risk and its
management is therefore a topicvery much at the centre of the
Government&#146;s modernisation agenda. The Government, of course,
face risk management challenges that are much wider than those faced by
other sectors of the economy. We have to manage risk not only within
the operations and machinery of government but to society and the
nation as a whole. That brings wide-ranging issues about the balance
between the rights of individuals to take risks in their own lives, how
the risk-taking decisions of one party might affect others, whether and
how Government should constrain the risk-taking decisions of others,
and the role of Government in managing risks to the public which the
public themselves are not in a position fully to evaluate and
manage.</p><p><a name="06110624000116"></a>Inevitably, risk is a
function of our need to find the best solutions to the toughest
challenges we face. Some in public service may be a little more
risk-averse than others, as was highlighted in the very interesting
exchange between two members of the Committee this afternoon. In some
instances that will be for very good reasons. As a Government, we take
seriously our responsibility for the public and for making good 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>use of their money. But make no mistake: risk is an inescapable fact of
life. We should engage with it and not shy away from
it.</p><p><a name="06110624000117"></a>We need to recognise and
acknowledge that well-managed risk taking is as much about identifying
and supporting opportunity and innovation as it is about managing
down-side risk. In doing so, we need a culture in government that
supports risk taking.</p><p><a name="06110624000118"></a>In July,
the Prime Minister said that Ministers should back up the Civil Service
where it takes tough, difficult decisions, and particularly when it
becomes a risk-taker. When we take risks, even after careful assessment
and deliberation, there is always a chance that we might fail. It is
simply not practicable to eliminate all risk. As Lord Stockton once
said:</p><ul><a name="06110624000243"></a>&#147;To be alive at
all involves some risk&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110624000119"></a>Innovation requires a willingness to
challenge and a perseverance towards achieving a goal. We recognise the
need for this behaviour to be encouraged within the public sector
because in the public sector, innovation is the bedrock of our ability
as a Government and as a country to go further and to do more. The
noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, highlighted what she thought was a
different attitude in the private sector. Perhaps there are different
starting points, but we need to encourage the public sector and ensure
that it is engaged in identifying risks, taking risks and proper risk
management.</p><p><a name="06110624000120"></a>I have already
referred to the Government&#146;s risk programme, which reported that
progress has been made, and departments&#146; self-assessments and
reports by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee
confirm that. Departments are now in a much better position to manage
the really big risks that they face, to support innovation and change,
and to avoid shocks and crises. They are increasingly able to
demonstrate how risk management is contributing to the improved
delivery of results. Risk-based resource allocation is becoming more
and more common, and it allows targeting of effort where it can most
improve outcomes.</p><p><a name="06110624000121"></a>Last March,
the Treasury published <I>Risk: Good Practice in
Government</I>&#151;a good practice guide that helps departments to
learn from each other&#146;s successes in embedding risk management.
A second volume will follow later this year&#151;just in time for
Christmas. But there is still much to do. We need to continue to work
towards a government culture where everyone regards themselves as a
risk manager and where well judged risk-taking is widely encouraged and
rewarded.</p><p><a name="06110624000122"></a>Departmental
capability reviews are now under way and we are confident that they are
already revealing valuable lessons about ways in which government can
improve their capability to deliver their objectives with
effectiveness, efficiency and economy. The capability reviews
specifically identify the management of risk under both delivery and
strategy capabilities, with an effective corporate culture being
identified under the third capability, which is leadership. The reviews
highlight the need to consider both policy and delivery if government
are to manage risk successfully. The first four reports were published
in July. They indicate that risk 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>management has been integral to, and firmly within the scope of, the
capability reviews undertaken so
far.</p><p><a name="06110624000123"></a>My noble friend Lord
Macdonald referred to work that the Government have undertaken in
focusingon risk-based regulation to pursue better and
more proportionate regulation. All departments responsible for aspects
of business regulation have to present to the Prime Minister&#146;s
Panel for Regulatory Accountability their assessments of the existing
costs to business of administering regulations and their plans for
delivering progressive reductions in the administrative burden of their
regulations. This is due to be completed by the 2006 Pre-Budget Report.
Departments are expected to achieve those reductions by implementing
the recommendations of the Hampton review, published in March 2005. I
was asked by the noble Baroness whether these procedures would impact
on attitudes and whether there would be a change. We have to ensure
that that is the case, and, if we carry through and review those proper
processes, I believe that that will be
so.</p><p><a name="06110624000124"></a>The Better Regulation
Commission&#146;s recently published report on risk, responsibility
and regulation makes several recommendations, including that
responsibility for managing risk should be left with those best placed
to manage it and that state regulation should be embarked on only where
it represents the optimum solution for managing risk. Ministers and
senior civil servants, including government legal advisers, should, as
part ofthe National School of Government training programmes,
receive training on understanding risk and the options for managing it.
We need to ensure that all government departments and regulators put in
place ongoing and effective systems of liaison and consultation with
their key stakeholders to address risk management issues in their
policy areas. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that that is a
matter for politicians as well as for the Civil Service. We need to
provide an effective system of incentives for Ministers and civil
servants to ensure that proper account is taken of risk.</p><p><a name="06110624000125"></a>The Government are considering their
response to the recommendations in the BRC&#146;s report, but all the
recommendations demonstrate that the need to manage risk well remains a
key issue for us to focus on. We know that we want to ensure that every
organisation has &#147;embedded and effective&#148; risk
management&#151;that is, where the good management of risk is an
integral part of the core processes of the organisation, where everyone
takes responsibility for managing risks, and where that makes an
effective contribution to achieving outcomes.</p><p><a name="06110624000126"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a
Division in the House from 5.29 to 5.39

McKenzie of Luton:</b> Good risk management should
give our organisations confidence to achieve high performance. The risk
management agenda needs leadership at Cabinet and all other levels.
That means motivating and enabling our people on the front line. That
is a function of the leadership we must give.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110624000128"></a>Let me put this in a wider context. The
Government&#146;s ongoing Comprehensive Spending Review demonstrates
our determination to ensure that we are focused on delivering needed
serviceswith the best possible value for the public purse. In
this context, understanding risk is vital: good understanding of both
the threats to good, value-for-money public services, and the
opportunities to deliver in new ways which enhance quality and value.
The CSR provides the Government with an important opportunity to drive
forward innovation in government&#151;innovation in what we do and
how we do it.</p><p><a name="06110624000129"></a>We must look for
innovation that can supportthe demands of efficiency
programmes and organisational changes, match the expectations of our
citizens and seek ever-better public services. We have a duty to
deliver on those expectations. To make that happen, government itself
must be as efficient as possible. To do this, we are promoting and
informing good practice through risk management seminars, where
Ministers have already shown an appetite for greater
involvement in risk and financial
management.</p><p><a name="06110624000130"></a>In practical terms,
departments should continue to seek to improve the collective
management of their overall portfolio of risks, and the risks they must
manage in partnership with others. Further, contingency planning
arrangements and their testing need adequately to distinguish between
foreseeable business disruption risks and catastrophic risks. I shall
come back to that in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06110624000131"></a>We must also become
better at communicating about risk to the public. An
individual&#146;s perception of risk will drive their behaviour. If
people consider something to have a significant risk, it often does not
matter what politicians, scientists and the media say; they trust their
own instincts and beliefs. Increasingly, people want to make their own
minds up about how they respond to particular risks. That presents a
dilemma for the Government, as policies are often developed which may
lead to some individuals feeling that their individual rights are being
compromised. The passive smoking policy, which your Lordships robustly
debated in this place in June, demonstrates how the management of risk
by the Government can lead to such
concerns.</p><p><a name="06110624000132"></a>I was not going to say
much more about passive smoking, other than it would be a pity if our
good debate on this excellent report were overly focused on that single
issue. I know that it exercised the noble Lords, Lord Wakeham and Lord
Stoddart, and the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, greatly. I
reiterate what the noble Baroness said: contrary to the statements in
the committee&#146;s report, there has been extensive private, public
and political debate throughout this process on the most appropriate
policy response to the hazards of second-hand smoke. The merits of
alternative policies were extensively examined, including in the
regulatory impact assessments published with the Bill and White Paper.
It is difficult to think of many issues of public health policy that
received more debate and investigation in the recent past.</p>

those risks which affect us all; global climate change, sustainable
lifestyles, secure energy supplies and global terrorism are all
examples of the complex issues that we face. Improved risk management
will enable the Government to develop effective policies to meet them:
something on which my noble friend Lord Giddens particularly focused.
Issues such as terrorism, climate change, globalisation and pandemic
flu illustrate just how difficult it can be for the Government to react
to large risks. Often, the risks associated with taking some action, or
a set of actions, will be counterbalanced by the risks of not taking
action. There can never be a simple formula for dealing with these
sorts of complex issues, and people will disagree about the
detail.</p><p><a name="06110624000134"></a>Often, the risks are
not well understood. That may be a matter of scientific uncertainty
but, where the science is not sufficiently well developed to provide a
clear answer on, say, how great a risk is, it may be more a lack of
information or sheer complexity. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, focused on
this, in particular, in relation to the Stern Report. That is
absolutely right.</p><p><a name="06110624000135"></a>The
Government have of course set up the Horizon Scanning Centre, which is
looking forward to see what risks might be out there which must be
addressed, and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, referred to by my
noble friend Lord Macdonald. I refer my noble friend Lord Giddens to
the <I>Risk: Good Practice in Government</I> guide, issued in March,
which has concrete examples of the Foreign Office, in particular,
dealing with emergencies.</p><p><a name="06110624000136"></a>The
media have what appears to be an increasingly significant role to play
in our society in shaping and informing people&#146;s perceptions and
opinions. The internet and 24-hour media coverage provide streams of
information to the public, presenting a real challenge for the
Government to get our message heard and understood. That is especially
truefor matters of risk. Concerns about the media presentation
of government policy are a little like having concerns about the
weather. It is there, and you have to be prepared for all
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06110624000137"></a>We
need the media to present facts and information in a way that
accurately and reasonably frames the risks that individuals face so
that perceptions, and therefore actions, are not skewed. The noble
Lord, Lord Newby, focused on whether sufficient use was made of the
Press Complaints Commission, which is a fair
point.</p><p><a name="06110624000138"></a>Other
points were raised in the debate, which I shall try to deal with. Both
the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes,
focused on the balance between the rights of individuals and the
interests of wider society. They are absolutely right; we strongly
endorse the need for an appropriate balance. But I reiterate that we
have reached the conclusion that we do not need to include an
assessment of impact on personal freedoms in the regulatory impact
assessment guidance currently being revised. The declaration has to be
made on a case-by-case basis, but I think that other bodies form an
appropriate mechanism for taking stock of the collective effect.

required.</p><p><a name="06110624000139"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0004.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06110624000288"></a>Baroness

liberties?</p><p><a name="06110624000140"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0004.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06110624000289"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am not saying that the
Government do not have a role in this. It is a question of whether they
do it through the mechanism of regulatory impact assessments or through
other channels and other means. We believe that the other means I have
outlined are a more effective way of dealing with it. But, as with all
these matters, it is right that we keep them under review. The
Government have been very robust. We have introduced the Human Rights
Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and so the background and
backdrop to enable these assessments to be made are fully
available.</p><p><a name="06110624000141"></a>As
to Treasury guidance and how resources should be deployed, particularly
in relation to road and rail, there is a guidance that incorporates a
framework&#151;the concern assessment tool. It seeks to understand
people&#146;s concerns in order that they can be considered in policy
development and in the development of related consultation arrangements
and communication strategies. A number of factors have been known to
correlate with public concern. They include people&#146;s awareness,
experience and understanding of a particular risk&#151;they tend to
be more concerned if they do not know much about a risk or have rarely
experienced exposure to a risk that is new to them; whether they
consider the potential effects of a risk to be particularly feared or
inequitable&#151;if the risks and rewards are unequally spread across
society, for example; and how much they feel they are in control of the
risk&#151;for example, even though the risk of death is greater in a
car than in a train, a matter touched upon earlier, many people see it
as safer because they are in control of the car, no matter how much
they trust others who manage the risk for
them.</p><p><a name="06110624000142"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Sheldon, and others referred to the question of whether there is a
compensation culture. The Government agree that the statistical
evidence does not support the notion that a compensation culture
exists. However, the Better Regulation Task Force found there was a
perception that one did and that that was having a damaging influence
on behaviour. In the work on tackling this perception, the Government
do not consider that the policy is being pushed in a risk-averse
direction. Rather, we are driving policy in the opposite direction so
that people have a better understanding of their rights and
responsibilities and are encouraged to adopt sensible and proportionate
risk-management procedures without being excessively
risk-averse.</p><p><a name="06110624000143"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Noakes, raised the issue of EU rule-making. During our presidency
of the EU, we have ensured that comprehensive impact assessments are
undertaken for all new EU legislation and, for the first time, that the
administrative burden 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on business or EU proposals is clearly and transparently measured. We
will challenge the Commission to ensure that existing regulations are
reformed so that they can be implemented in a risk-based way. Following
current consultation with business, we will submit a dossier of
proposals for the simplification of EU regulations and work with the
Commission and other member states to create a timetable for delivering
regulatory simplification during 2006. From 2006 onwards, we shall
continue to argue for better European regulation, developing a clearer
voice for business in the EU rule-making process with the
Commission&#146;s proposed independent advisory network, and we are
working with member states to apply risk-based regulatory practice
across national regulatory frameworks, including in Europe.
</p><p><a name="06110624000144"></a>As the Prime
Minister has said, we cannot eliminate risk. It is a fact of life, and
our task is to manage it as well as we possibly can in the interests of
efficient and effective government and for the good of the public. We
know that we have achieved a lot in government in recent years.
However, we are only part-way on our journey, and we have to continue
to work to ensure that the whole of government maintain a good minimum
standard of risk management at the least. Beyond that, we must continue
to reach for our aim of world-class standards of risk management by and
in government in order to provide world-class government and public
services which are adaptable to the changing demands of the modern
world.</p><p><a name="06110624000145"></a>This debate has been
stimulating, wide-ranging, well informed, interesting and valuable. The
Government thank your Lordships both for this debate and for the
preceding inquiry into what is an increasingly important
subject.</p><h5><a name="06110624000265"></a>5.51

Wakeham:</b> It has been a very good and interesting
debate, and I thank all noble Lords who have taken part. Many made very
interesting comments, which are worthy of further discussion. However,
I shall refer only to the issue of major risk, which was raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens. He immediately brought to mind our previous
report on the economics of climate change, in which we indicated that
we thought that the economics were not right and that the risks were
not properly understood, and we recommended that the Treasury look at
the figures. Three weeks after we produced that report, the Government
set up a committee under Sir Nicholas Stern, which we considered to be
a good and speedy response. I am not entirely sure that Sir
Nicholas&#146;s report has completely dissipated some of the doubts
that exist, but that debate will go on.</p><p><a name="06110624000147"></a>One thing that came out in this report
was that everyone accepted that risk is an inherent part of virtually
every policy decision that has to be taken. Broadly, we took a very
positive view of the way that the Government are dealing with
it.</p><p><a name="06110624000148"></a>I finish with one last
point. I think that the House authorities, or whoever it may be, should
make it clear to noble Lords that debates in this Room carry the same
conventions and rules as apply in the main

practice to send in his or her name in advance. To that extent, I am
most grateful to my noble friend Lady O&#146;Cathain and the noble
Lord, Lord Stoddart, who spoke in the gap, but I know that several
noble Lords realised that they had not submitted their names and did
not take part in the debate when they should have done. I think that
someone should ensure that noble Lords&#146; education is brought up
to speed on that point.</p><p><a name="06110624000149"></a>On

pm</h5><p><a name="06110624000150"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0004.htm_spnew140"></a><a name="06110624000291"></a>Baroness
Miller of Chilthorne Domer</b> rose tomove,
That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered
the England Rural Development Programme (Closure of Project-Based
Schemes) Regulations 2006 [<I>45th Report from the Merits
Committee</I>.]</p><p><a name="06110624000151"></a>The noble
Baroness said: I start by thanking members of the Merits Committee,
which, in its 45th<sup></sup>report, as always, made a splendid job of
highlighting the effect of regulations and drawing the House&#146;s
attention to things that it thinks are particularly worrying. In this
report, they talk about the continuing uncertainty of the start date
for funding under the new rural development programme following the
closure of the old programme through these regulations. They say that
the new funding may well not come on stream until significantly beyond
January 2007. The reason for bringing forward a debate on these
regulations is to reinforce the committee&#146;s worries about the
timescale, and I seek to draw those out in the hope that the Minister
may be able to allay our fears. If not, I want at least to put on the
record some of the issues.</p><p><a name="06110624000152"></a>Rural
development is taking three blows at the moment, two of which affect
England only and one of which is UK-wide. The first is the &#163;22
million sucked out of the rural economy this year by the delay in Rural
Payments Agency payments to farmers. We have debated that issue before
and no doubt we will do so again. At best, it has created a climate of
uncertainty and, at worst, it has caused hardship across swathes of
England, but I shall not dwell on that today. The second blow is the
regulation which will bring to a close four rural development
programmes. The closure of these schemes is the result of a new rural
development programme due to start in 2007 and run until 2013. The
third blow was announced by the Government in a Written Statement on 1
November. The rural development programme for 2007 will in practice be
delayed for so long that it is unlikely to start before 2008, despite
the fact that the regulations we are considering this evening will
result in the closure of the old schemes. For rural areas, that will
mean that vast numbers of projects important both to the economy and
the environment will be put on hold.</p>



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110624000153"></a>The new rural development programme, when
it finally does start, will move from being delivered by Defra as part
of the Rural Enterprise Scheme to being delivered by the regional
development agencies. This is what was suggested by the noble Lord,
Lord Haskins, and we supported the streamlining of such delivery, but I
am sure the Minister is aware that delivery by the regional development
agencies of their own schemes, known as Rural Renaissance, has
proved&#151;particularly in the south-west&#151;to be such a
nightmare of appraisal boards and more boards appraising those
appraisal boards that almost no new projects have started up since
2003. My question to the Minister is: what lessons has Defra learnt,
especially given the RPA d&#233;b&#226;cle and the reallocation of
payments, about making the switch from the Rural Enterprise Scheme
within Defra to schemes administered by the regional development
agencies?</p><p><a name="06110624000154"></a>I
turn now to the four schemes being closed under these regulations. The
first is the Rural Enterprise Scheme, which is perhaps the most
important. It is a myriad of small, valuable projects that help to
introduce innovation and diversification in order to aid the economy
and the environment. I shall briefly run through a list from
Defra&#146;s own website of what is involved: agricultural water
resources management&#151;projects aimed at improving the management
of water resources, which, as the House will be aware, we debated
recently as a matter of great importance; and protection of the
environment in connection with agriculture, forestry and
landscape&#151;I believe these are equally important and the
Government have said as much several times. The Rural Enterprise Scheme
also covers basic services for the rural economy and population,
including out-of-school childcare projects, information and technology
links and all sorts of other infrastructure developments for dispersed
rural communities, all of which are essential for rural development.
The list also sets out a number of other things, including the
marketing of quality agricultural products, the renovation and
development of villages, the protection and conservation of our rural
heritage, diversification of agricultural activities, the development
and improvement of infrastructure connected with the development of
agriculture, and encouragement for tourism and craft activities. That
embraces pretty much everything that is important to rural development,
to jobs and to the
environment.</p><h5><a name="06110624000267"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06110624000155"></a>That is the first scheme that
is closing. The second is the vocational training scheme, which updates
skills in agriculture and hopes also to give skills to people who want
to diversify out of those and expand their skills base. Again this is
extremely important, particularly for remoter rural areas where access
to mainstream training may be very difficult to access.</p><p><a name="06110624000156"></a>The third scheme is the processing and
marketing grant, which covers all the sorts of things that might come
into localising food chains&#151;something that is now dear to the
Government&#146;s heart. I declare an interest as chairman of
Somerset Food Links. The grant includes adding value to agricultural
products and, I believe, meeting the public procurement goals for food
falls into this category. It is the sort of work 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that will help the Government to achieve the increased purchase of local
food for consumption that is now very much part of the school meals
agenda.</p><p><a name="06110624000157"></a>Fourthly, the energy
crops scheme encourages the planting of miscanthus and short rotation
croppice. It is particularly depressing that, even though co-firing
with biomass has been shown to be one of the most effective routes now
available for carbon reduction, the scheme was closed to new entrants a
month before the Stern report was published. So one of the few schemes
that are actually producing some carbon-cutting results has been
closed.</p><p><a name="06110624000158"></a>All of the above
schemes have just closed and there will be no new projects. My question
is: for how long? Will this just be a blip or is it a yawning great
hole? My fear is that it is the latter. There will effectively be no
programme for rural development next year. Rural development is off for
2007 because, in December 2005, Tony Blair agreed a budget that left it
the under-funded poor relation of the EU Budget. Effectively, rural
areas paid the price for an agreed EU budget, but no one decided
exactly what price that would be.</p><p><a name="06110624000159"></a>CAP reform was, of course, a worthy goal
and is rightly moving in a direction from direct reduction subsidy to
environmental and development schemes, but the EU has yet to decide
exactly the size and shape of the new programme. That depends on how
much the receipts are and at what level modulation is set. That raises
two matters: the amount of money likely to be available and the
timescale. Historically the UK&#151;and this goes back to the
Conservative Government, who did not invest in rural areas at all in
the way they should have done&#151;has spent a pitiful amount on
rural development. The new programme is based on that historical
spend.</p><p><a name="06110624000160"></a>Although rural areas may
have 8 per cent of the population, we will only get 3.5 per cent of the
funds. That has been confirmed at about &#163;1.3 billion over the
period I have specified. However, that allocation does not include any
domestic matched funding, voluntary modulation receipts or state-aided
funded elements. So far the Government have made no commitment to
match-fund the modulated amount. When will the Minister be in a
position to make an announcement about that? Until the Government at
least make an announcement, it will be impossible for people in rural
areas to make plans on any basis of financial certainty. Not only are
we waiting for the decisions from Brussels that were the subject of the
Statement on 1 November, but we are also waiting for the Government to
make up their minds on what they will match-fund, and how
much.</p><p><a name="06110624000161"></a>When is
the earliest possible date that rural development programmes could
start again? The Government&#146;s Statement on 1 November says it is
unlikely to be concluded before spring 2007. The UK Government say
that, until the regulation is in place, they cannot submit a UK
programme to Brussels, although we find it hard to see why they cannot
submit a draft programme that can be rubber stamped after that, which
would at least gain several months. When the regulation is in place,
the UK Government will need 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>time to finalise the UK programme; say, at least two months&#151;eight
weeks&#151;if they work really quickly. That takes us to June 2007,
if all goes smoothly. Once the programme is submitted, the Government
say that it will be at least six months until it is approved, so there
we are: that is at the end of 2007, if everything goes really
smoothly.</p><p><a name="06110624000162"></a>It is unlikely,
therefore, that anything will happen for new rural development schemes
before 2008. We in rural areas do not have time to stall in this way.
It is much harder to get something started again once it has stalled.
The entire rural development programme is at great risk. It needs the
Government to put all their effort behind it. These regulations give us
the opportunity to debate the issue.</p><p><a name="06110624000163"></a>Finally, I must refer to the correctness
of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, that other people were
interested in taking part in this debate, but did not realise that they
had to put their names down because it was taking place in the Moses
Room. He raised an important point, because several other people share
that thought.</p><p><a name="06110624000164"></a><b><a name="06110624000292"></a>The

Schemes) Regulation 2006 [<I>45th Report from the Merits
Committee</I>].&#151;(<I>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne
Domer</I>.)</p><p><a name="06110624000168"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0004.htm_spnew143"></a><a name="06110624000295"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> I apologise to the House if my voice
conks out on me. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of
Chilthorne Domer, for raising this important short debate on the order.
I think that we are all very disappointed to find ourselves in this
situation, and I am sure the Minister himself will reflect that as
well. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has set out seven issues. I do
not propose to repeat them, because she so clearly stated her reasons
why she was raising them. I remind the House of my family farming
interest. I also have a close interest in what goes on in the rural
countryside.</p><p><a name="06110624000169"></a>I shall pick up
where the noble Baroness left off. It was indeed last December, I
think, when Tony Blair tried to put forward the proposition to EU
member states and made the move that we would go down this route
ourselves anyway, only to find that the other member states were not
going to follow us. That is why we are in this predicament today. I
have one or two specific questions to ask the Minister. I follow the
noble Baroness: my calculation is that we would be 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lucky to have anything before the autumn of next year at the earliest,
and that is probably being a little ambitious. In the little notes I
made, I was querying why the EU had to be further involved in the
receipts from voluntary modulation when our country had, rightly or
wrongly, decided to go down that route. Are there implications that the
UK may have to negotiate over how much money it keeps, or is the amount
of money agreed and settled and so will not be challenged?</p><p><a name="06110624000170"></a>I pick up on the noble Baroness&#146;s
comment about the RDAs being the delivery body. She will remember well
that as a party we continue to question the view of the noble Lord,
Lord Haskins, that delivery should go through the RDAs. I still have
great concerns about that. The RDAs themselves will have priorities
within their own areas about how they will spend their funding. My
worry was then, and still is now, that in the East Midlands area, for
example&#151;thearea I come from&#151;very rural
Lincolnshire may well lose out to the bigger conurbations of Derby,
Nottingham, Leicester and Northampton. If we go down that route, we
need to ensure that they are not jeopardised just because there are
fewer voices having a say on the things that are important to that
area. It is an old chestnut, but it is still with
us.</p><p><a name="06110624000171"></a>Does the Minister anticipate
further delays in addition to those we already know about? Are there
ongoing discussions between the UK Government and the EU on voluntary
modulation? To pick up on the noble Baroness&#146;s point, could the
Minister tell us more about what has been agreed on domestic matched
funding?</p><p><a name="06110624000172"></a>The Merits
Committee&#146;s excellent report mentions the figure of &#163;1.3
billion for the United Kingdom. The order is only England-based, so I
would be grateful if the Minister would break down that figure and tell
me how much money is relevant only to England rather than the whole of
the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06110624000173"></a>On the
specific and detailed points, what happens to the farms that are
cross-border with Wales or Scotland? There have been implications for
the single farm payment with regard to cross-border payments. What
would happen in those circumstances and how would the Government deal
with that?</p><p><a name="06110624000174"></a>I know that this
point is a little further from the noble Baroness&#146;s direct
contribution, but it is about the uplands areas. Will this affect the
hill-farming payments which are already either late or have not been
paid? The Minister will correct me if I am wrong about that. Will any
people who might have looked to some of these schemes find themselves
doubly hard done by? That is dreadfully bad English, but I think the
Minister will get my
drift.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61106-gc0005.htm"/>


<p><a name="06110624000175"></a>Can we
have further clarification with regard to anybody who has proposed a
scheme which is not yet in being but which has been accepted into the
thinking part of that scheme? Will that definitely not be considered as
a possible scheme? I understand that the Government have undertaken to
fulfil the agreements that are already in being&#151;from where I am
not sure and would be glad of clarification&#151;but that no new
schemes will be considered. Existing schemes will be able to go ahead, 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but in the mean time, will other schemes in the process of going forward
be considered or will they have to wait another full year before
anything happens?</p><p><a name="06110624000176"></a>I hope that I
am not being too wide of the mark, because I am trying to keep my
comments within the restrictions of the order, but will that affect
higher-level and entry-level schemes or are they further from what we
are considering tonight?</p><p><a name="06110624000177"></a>I hope
that I have added a little to our discussion. We are grateful to the
Minister, as always, for the conscientious way in which he responds to
our queries. As he will be aware, however, one thing that has suffered
enormously, looking at it purely from the farming side, has been the
lack of hope for farmers who are looking to diversify, as some of them
know that they have to do, to succeed in going forward. That
uncertainty has caused so much distress. Any clarification that we can
receive tonight will only be good; even if people fear the worst, at
least they know whence they are starting.</p><p><a name="06110624000178"></a>Lastly, I move away from agriculture
<I>per se</I>, and ask the Minister how he sees the effect of these new
orders and the gap&#151;it looks like we may have a gap
year&#151;on the actual expansion or diversification of rural
businesses which might wish to diversify, outside the pure farming
businesses. We sometimes try to raise the issue but it falls within
rural affairs, which are not always easy to cover. I suspect that some
of them will fall within these orders. Again, I seek clarification of
some of the questions that I and the noble Baroness have raised this
afternoon.</p><h5><a name="06110624000268"></a>6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06110624000179"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0005.htm_spnew144"></a><a name="06110624000296"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to
respond. Without causing myself further problems, I must say that this
is a sorry tale. While I shall do my best to respond to the detailed
questions, I shall not be able to go much beyond the detailed Written
Statement we issued on 1 November, at cols. WS14-15 of
<I>Hansard</I>.</p><p><a name="06110624000180"></a>There will clearly be a
delay in the launch of the next rural development programme. We greatly
regret that, which is why we issued the Statement last week. The key
reason is the budget. We have always stressed that the final shape and
size of the England programme depends on the availability of receipts
from voluntary modulation. I shall seek to obtain the breakdown of the
&#163;1.3 billion that the noble Baroness asked for. That &#163;1.3
billion is the approximate UK allocation for seven years, but does not
include domestic matched funding, voluntary modulation receipts or
state-aided elements. To give a total for the programme budget is
currently very hard, but I shall give as much information as possible.
The receipts are absolutely essential if we are to achieve our rural
development ambitions, such as environmental
stewardship.</p><p><a name="06110624000181"></a>Our
preparations for new programmes are well advanced but, until voluntary
modulation negotiations are concluded at European Union level, we
cannot reach our own decisions on the total programme. The programme
for 2007-13 must be approved by the Commission before we can start. As
the noble Baroness will realise from our Statement, the Commission will
have up to six months to approve the programmes 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC90"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>after formal submission. That means that UK programmes will start late,
and I deeply regret that I cannot say when. It is wholly out of my
control. In some ways, it is currently out of Defra&#146;s control
for the reasons set out in the Statement. That is deeply disappointing
to me, the department and the Government as a whole. I am afraid, in
this case, the first port of call for farmers, land managers and other
rural beneficiaries is Defra. I am not passing the buck to the European
Union, but I have little control over what is happening and the delay
on this.</p><p><a name="06110624000182"></a>We are discussing
contingency arrangements with the Commission. The recently adopted
transitional regulation gives us legal cover to pay existing
commitments under the current programme. So the one thing I can be
positive about is that beneficiaries&#146; agreements under existing
programmes will continue to be honoured, notwithstanding the delay.
Clearly, some programmes will have a spill-over into 2007, but they
will continue to be honoured. Our officials are working closely with
the European Commission and delivery bodies to achieve this. In our
Statement last week, we have committed to keeping Parliament fully
informed.</p><p><a name="06110624000183"></a>For the avoidance of
doubt, and for those outside who listen to our proceedings: we cannot
open the current project-based schemes. That is not a practical
proposition. The current England programme will of course close when
the EU rural development regulation is repealed on 31 December. There
is no legal basis for new agreements under project-based schemes after
that date. This was, of course, the consequence of a difficult decision
taken much earlier this year and, announced in February, to close new
applications for entry to the schemes as of 30 June this year. We
wanted to allow sufficient time for applications before the programme
closed and get an orderly handover to ongoing commitments. This enabled
the Rural Development Service to make some funding decisions on the
continuity of service to deliver schemes before Natural England emerged
on1 October 2006. The main aim of that transition period was
to minimise the risk that customers would be disrupted because of this
changeover and to reduce margins of error in administration. I can
report to my noble colleagues that the handover appears to have gone
well.</p><p><a name="06110624000184"></a>The rural development
agencies&#151;I note the point the noble Baroness made about
them&#151;took responsibility for the legacy project based on schemes
from 1 October and are managing the live projects handover. The RDAs
authorise the payments and undertake the European Union-required
inspections for approximately 1,600 projects across the country. Before
the new programmes are agreed, the rural development agencies, plus the
regional partners and stakeholders, have to finalise priorities,
discuss funding possibilities and work with local action groups. We are
working closely with the RDAs on the next
programme.</p><p><a name="06110624000185"></a>I know there is some
underlying criticism of the RDAs&#151;not so much because of their
rationale but because when they were first set up they looked very much
like urban priority organisations. That is not 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the case now. As the years have gone by, they have been reaffirmed. The
week before last, I met with the chair of the RDA for the east of
England, the lead RDA on Defra issues, and I have arranged to meet in
January all the members of the RDA boards who hold the rural brief. In
fact, I hope to do so in the convivial surroundings of the House of
Lords&#151;so there is such a thing as a free dinner, I
suppose.</p><p><a name="06110624000186"></a>I take this very
seriously. While I can see the chairs of the RDAs at any time during
their regular six-weekly meetings at the DTI in Victoria Street, I want
to see the people who have the responsibility for the rural programme
at board level on the RDAs. While I have to leave it to the RDAs to
execute the job and the details as and when the programmes
arrive&#151;I must not be an interfering Minister&#151;I am not a
hands-off Minister. At the end of the day, I am the one who must stand
at the Dispatch Box answering questions, not the RDA chairs or chief
executives. So, to that extent, I want to reach the people with that
responsibility and emphasise that I wish to work in partnership with
them but that we want effective action on the rural
programme.</p><p><a name="06110624000187"></a>The
RDAs are working closely together. Indeed, in my travels in the
country&#151; limited though they have been in the past few weeks
because of the obvious necessity of being London-based&#151;the chief
executives of a couple of RDAs spoke to me about some of the rural
programmes they had been working on outside of these particular
programmes. They wanted to talk about it because they were keen to
assure me that they were seized of the issue. One would have been
classed as one of the most urban smokestack RDAs when it was set up.
Nevertheless, it is responsible for huge areas of the countryside,
including some of the least densely populated county in England. That
is
important.</p><p><a name="06110624000188"></a>The voluntary
modulation proposals will allow UK receipts to remain within the UK,
which is what we want. That is one of the advantages of the proposals
and is why the EU is involved here. I understand that the legal basis
for voluntary modulation expires after the single farm payments for
2006 have been made, so we need a new EU regulation. We are currently
considering the intra-UK allocations, but in the absence of a voluntary
modulation regulation, it is difficult to do that. I hope to provide
details in this respect as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="06110624000189"></a>At the Royal Show, my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State confirmed our intention
to run the hill farm allowance in 2007; he made that absolutely clear.
We are making every effort to run the schemes as planned and we will
publish details of the contingency arrangements as soon as possible.
The noble Baroness will also appreciate that we have been consulting on
the allowance and further work is going on.</p><p><a name="06110624000190"></a>During the past few
days I have discussed these issues with stakeholder colleagues from the
industry, in particular the NFU, and with colleagues in Defra. I want a
satisfactory solution, but what I do not want is unnecessary disruption
to hill farmers for a couple of years before something new starts. We
will look at the options. I know that there have been a few stories in 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the farming press, but, nevertheless, our task is to ensure that we pass
on maximum aid to hill farmers, perhaps using slightly different
arrangements, but with a commitment to keep it for 2007 although it may
go on for a little longer to prevent future disruption. We will report
back as soon as possible, but I cannot go beyond what I have said at
present. I am sorry about that. We want to target areas of need rather
than respond to the loudest voices, but I appreciate the difficulties
in the hills and how classification means that payments are made at
different rates.</p><p><a name="06110624000191"></a>Although I
know that this is important in terms of the programmes which are the
subject of this order, Defra is already putting some &#163;73 million
into rural development through the RDAs. These schemes are vital. I
have brought with me the glossy leaflets kindly provided during a
briefing last week. I have to say that it all looks like a bit too much
red tape when you read all the bullet points and rules, but it is
public money and we have to be careful of the EU auditors.
Nevertheless, as the noble Baroness made clear when she listed them,
these are real and practical schemes that are vital to the rural
economy. This is a very important
issue.</p><p><a name="06110624000192"></a>In our response to the
Biomass Task Force report, we made clear our principled support for
energy crops within the new rural development programme and we will
outline this in greater detail as soon as possible. The 2005 farming
budget deal, if I can put it that way, was a complicated process. I
looked at it from afar, I may add&#151;from across the water in
Northern Ireland. At the time the UK held the EU presidency. Sometimes
it can be a disadvantage to be in the chair, to put it mildly. You
cannot fix things for yourself, you must almost stand aside to win
concessions and promote negotiations for the greater good of the club.
The deals have to be secured and we did that, but we were not able to
fix it for the UK. Holding the presidency means that you have a few
fingers tied behind your back&#151;not exactly a whole hand, but
there is that difficulty. Ministers in the other place understand this
problem when they realise that they cannot deal with constituency
arrangements because that would be totally wrong. They have to act
ministerially, just as we had to act presidentially.</p><p><a name="06110624000193"></a>The provisions for voluntary modulation
allow us to top-up spending. I have the impression that virtually every
government department is in daily contact with the Treasury on a range
of issues. That is not a buck-pass, but certainly that is the case as
far as we are concerned. Unlike most departments, we are governed very
much by our membership of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU.
That is crucial and the way it should be. Nevertheless, we are in
constant touch with the Treasury. Until we know about the voluntary
modulation, it is difficult for us to say what will happen about match
funding. I much regret that; I am standing up but I am not able to give
positive responses to anybody in the countryside except to say that the
schemes will arrive. I hope that we will not lose any money; the
breakdown of the money has not arrived, so I will have to write to
colleagues about that. But because of the delay, although I cannot give
the total now, we can see how the pot of money is made up. The delay
should not

Once we have agreed voluntary modulation, looked at match funding and
talked to our colleagues in the Treasury on those and other matters and
then gone back to the EU with a programme, that will take six
months.</p><p><a name="06110624000194"></a>The Written Statement
of 1 November said that, at
present,</p><ul><a name="06110624000256"></a>&#147;the progress
of the regulation is stalled in the European
Parliament&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>1/11/06; col. WS
14.]</ul><a name="06110624000225"></a>It is completely
outside our control and, in some ways, outside the Commission&#146;s
while it is stalled in the European Parliament. I do not know the exact
details, but if Euro MPs are worth anything, that is where they should
be lobbying. As a UK Minister, I cannot interfere with the European
Parliament&#151;that is simply not
possible.<p><a name="06110624000195"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0005.htm_spnew145"></a><a name="06110624000297"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> The Minister is being very constructive.
If, for any reason, the European Parliament says no to us again, have
the Government considered changing their mind? At present, we are the
only country to go down the voluntary modulation road, and that will be
a competitive disadvantage to English farmers. So if the question comes
up again and the answer is still no, where do we go from
there?</p><p><a name="06110624000196"></a><b><a name="61106-gc0005.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06110624000298"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> That is a very good question but I will
have to come back on it at the time. We have to have some contingency
plans, but we hope that that will not happen. We are in constant touch
with Brussels. I do not want to be negative, but I will face the
situation when it arises. If it does happen, though, I hope it will not
be a surprise and that we have a plan B. We want to do it this way and
we have to look at other aspects of voluntary modulation for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. It is vital to them. It is a consequence of
historical decisions that have been made in the past. We freely admit
in this country that we did not spend and prioritise as much in the
past on rural programmes, which is the root cause of our losing out on
the totality of funds. That was a mistake. Some 25 per cent of the
population live in rural areas. They may not work in rural areas and
they do not depend on agriculture, but the spin-off 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the rural economy is enormous. We are paying the price for past
errors, but we must do the best we can to get an early decision and
then make sure we can get schemes up and running as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="06110624000197"></a>I will write about the
detailed issues and the breakdown. It may not be possible; as I said,
the figure is &#163;1.3 billion, but I cannot give the breakdown for
England. I will write to confirm if that is the case.

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I thank the Minister.
He has replied with his normal courtesy and frankness to the questions
to which he was able to reply. As he said, some of this is completely
out of his hands. I very much enjoyed his description of Rural
Development Agency projects as live projects. I hope that he will bear
that phrase in mind when he sees the members who carry the rural brief
from the boards. That was one of the most interesting parts of his
reply, and I am very glad that he has taken that initiative.</p><p><a name="06110624000199"></a>I hope he will be able
to discuss with them the outcomes from projects, as opposed to the
tick-box mentality, which has run how they have acted until now. Also,
how they allocate projects should be closely tied to rural areas of
deprivation&#151;not necessarily where it is easiest to develop
projects, but where they need to happen. I refer to some projects that
do not necessarily apply to farming but are critical, such as childcare
and ICT. They need to consider the hard-to-tackle areas. I congratulate
him on the initiative of getting in those board members because, as he
rightly says, much responsibility stops with them to bring those issues
to the attention of the board.</p><p><a name="06110624000200"></a>Given that there will be that hiatus in
rural development programming, the other important message must be
that, once the funding comes on-stream again, they must be ready to get
up and running quickly with the programmes and that staff have not
drifted off in other directions and are no longer thinking about rural
development. I look forward to further developments on this
front.</p><p><a name="06110624000201"></a>On Question, Motion
agreed to.</p><ul><ul><ul>The Committee

Minister of State, Department of Health (Lord
Warner):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written
Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06110616000008"></a>The
joint investigation by the Healthcare Commission and Commission for
Social Care Inspection into learning disability services at Cornwall
Partnerships NHS Trust identified systematic abuse of people in a
number of the trust's learning disability services. In response to the
publication of the commissions&#146; joint report on6 July
2006, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Patricia
Hewitt) and I made a commitment to ensure progress against the local
and national recommendations made in that report. This commitment to
maintain an ongoing involvement and focus on improvements was our
recognition of the severity of what was uncovered in Cornwall and the
need for significant change locally, as well as the need to ensure that
the circumstances that led to those events do not occur
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06110616000009"></a>As
stated in my Written Ministerial Statement on6 July
(<I>Official Report</I>, col. 48WS) and my right honourable
friend&#146;s response to an urgent question on the matter on 11 July
(<I>Official Report</I>, cols 1253-61) Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust
was placed on special measures following a recommendation by the
Healthcare Commission. Although the special measures apply directly to
Cornwall Partnership Trust, the trust, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly
Primary Care Trust, NHS South West and Cornwall County Council have
developed an action plan to deliver on the recommendations stemming
from the investigation's findings. The strategic health authority, the
Healthcare Commission and Commission for Social Care Inspection have
agreed this action plan and the local NHS and county council in
Cornwall are working in partnership to deliver on the action plan.
Progress is subject to quarterly reviews between the department, the
commissions, the local NHS and Cornwall County Council and covers both
the special measures and all the local recommendations in the
commission's joint inspection report. The multi-agency action plan
identifies both critical early actions to particular and immediate
change as well as actions for longer-term sustainability. The external
team appointed on the recommendation of the Healthcare Commission will
remain in place for a period of 12 months, as recommended in the
report. Progress against these actions will be subject to a review by
the regulators in July 2007 that will report back to my right
honourable friend the Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="06110616000010"></a>Progress
at a local level is encouraging, with a clear agreement for action to
be taken forward. The

trust's board and will report to the SHA in November. The review will
assess the robustnessof existing working arrangements and make
recommendations for
improvement.</p><p><a name="06110616000011"></a>Progress
is being made locally on commissioning modern community services and
appropriate supported living schemes to ensure that people are living
in suitable settings&#151;this work is taking into consideration the
needs of people who were living in Budock Hospital and the trust's
supported living services, as well as future commissioning
requirements. Work on developing a strategic commissioning framework
will include the integration and redesign of services together with
workforce development and
training.</p><p><a name="06110616000012"></a>A
multi-agency team, led by Cornwall County Council, is meeting monthly
to ensure an overview of all adult protection issues. Police
investigations are continuing and, to date, no charges have been
brought. A new adult protection police constable has been appointed and
is working with local services. Progress is being made with the
development of local self-advocacy and carers groups, including
engagement with national and local organisations with expertise in
family leadership and
advocacy.</p><p><a name="06110616000013"></a>Progress
continues to be made in respect of the investigation's national
recommendations on registration of services, assessments and
person-centred planning, safeguarding and robust local arrangements for
dealing with abuse:</p>The Chief Executive of the
National Health Service has written to strategic health authority chief
executives and chairs to ask them to take action to ensure that NHS
bodies that provide services in a housing association, voluntary or
charitable sector are registered with CSCI and, if they are not, apply
for registration immediately;I am holding a
conference with representatives from learning disability partnership
boards across England on 9 November. I will remind these local
multi-agency groups of their role in reviewing arrangements for joint
working The department has published guidance on the role of the
director of Adult Social Services, who has a lead role in safeguarding
vulnerable adults in their local
population;the department will be working
with the regulators to consider the performance framework with a view
to improving how we monitor learning disability
services;the department
continues to take forward a series of policies to safeguard and protect
adults, including the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill and
implementation of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Proposals to amend the
Mental Health Act to close the &#147;Bournewood gap&#148; are
progressing;the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, due to be implemented from 2008,
would require all employers, 



<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS23"></a><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column WS23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including those in the NHS, to refer individuals to the new Independent
Barring Board that the Bill will establish. Employers will be under the
duty to refer where they have or might have ceased to use an individual
on the grounds that they have harmed a child or vulnerable adult or
other relevant grounds. The definition of vulnerable adult includes all
adults receiving a health service;the
department published <I>No Secrets</I> in 2000. This says that each
agency should monitor and evaluate policies (3.13) and this should also
happen together as a multi-agency committee (3.18). Either a summary or
evidence report should be submitted to the local adult protection
agency;the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups
Bill would require all staff working with patients in the NHS to be
subject to the requirements of the scheme when it is implemented;
andinitially new staff
will be subject to the requirements of the scheme. Existing staff will
not be checked to begin with, but provision for all NHS staff
to be checked at some point in the future has been
made.<p><a name="06110616000014"></a>As
stated in July, the Healthcare Commission will be carrying out an audit
of all learning disability health services provided by the NHS and
independent sector. This audit is currently being piloted in three
locations and will be rolled out nationally in January 2007. The
Healthcare Commission will start engaging with services now to ensure
that they are well prepared to respond robustly to the audit. The
National Health Service Chief Executive's letter to strategic health
authorities has set out our expectations for compliance with the
Healthcare Commission's audit and the importance of effective
commissioning and delivery of learning disability services. This makes
clear that in the light of what has happened in Cornwall and the
subsequent formal investigation report by the Disability Rights
Commission into health inequalities experienced by people with learning
disabilities and mental health problems, strategic health authorities
and primary care trusts should ensure they have sufficient skilled
learning disability commissioning capacity in their establishments and
that these people should engage in local and regional inter-agency
Valuing People development work. The department will strengthen the
commissioning of learning disability services, and we will consider a
stronger role for local authorities as part of
this.</p><p><a name="06110616000015"></a>My right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has written to
National Health Service chairs asking them to working closely with
their chief executives on this agenda. In addition, the department's
newly appointed Director General of Social Care has written to
directors of Adult Social Services reminding them of their duty to
provide assessments of people's needs as set out in the NHS and
Community Care Act 1990. A further update to the House on overall
national progress across the learning disability agenda will be made in
December 2006.</p>

Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Douglas Alexander) has made the
following Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06110616000026"></a>In a Written Statement to the House
on28 November 2005, (<I>Hansard</I>, Commons; col.WS
2-4) the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that we were
awarding pump-priming for the Transport Innovation Fund (TIF) to seven
areas to develop packages of schemes that combined hard demand
management measures, such as road pricing, with better public
transport.</p><p><a name="06110616000027"></a>In May 2006 we
invited authorities to bid for the second round of pump-priming. I was
greatly encouraged by the innovative thinking demonstrated in the 21
bids received.</p><p><a name="06110616000028"></a>I am today
announcing pump-priming funding for nine areas to develop schemes. We
are awarding additional funding to six of the seven areas already in
receipt of funds from the first round. They
are:</p><p><a name="06110616000029"></a>Cambridgeshire;</p><p><a name="06110616000030"></a>Durham

Norwich).</p><p><a name="06110616000039"></a>The local authorities
in all these areas will be developing proposals for packages of
schemes. All of them are planning to look at local road pricing as part
of their consideration of demand management options. This award means
that 10 areas across England are giving serious consideration to local
road pricing schemes. This work could lead to pilots which will help to
inform discussion on a national road pricing scheme, providing
experience on the ground and scaleable propositions in respect of the
technology.</p><p><a name="06110616000040"></a>I should be clear
that receipt of this pump-priming funding is no guarantee that an
authority will be successful in bidding for the main Transport
Innovation Fund. We are, however, committed to working closely with the
successful authorities to deliver the work programmes set out in their
pump-priming bids, to support future decisions on the main Transport
Innovation Fund and on road pricing more broadly. We will also work
with other local authorities that have promising ideas for demand
management and this decision does not affect their ability to bid for
substantive TIF funding in the
future</p>

is possible that an agency supplying relief milkers may qualify for

this exemption, the worker supplied by the agency is required to hold a
level 2 National or Scottish National Vocational Qualification which is

(Lord Rooker):</b> About 550,000 tonnes of direct
mail are sent out every year (approximately 2 per cent of the household
waste stream). The Direct Mail Association (DMA), which represents
about 900 members involved in the direct mail and promotions industry,
signed an agreement with Government in July 2003 to raise recycling
levels to 30 percent by the end of 2005,55 per cent by the end
of 2009 and 70 per cent by the end of 2013. The DMA has also pledged to
help cut down on waste by improving the targeting of direct mail
campaigns and by publicising services such as the Mail Preference
Service, which enables people to stop direct mail being sent to them.
Further information on the service is available at
www.mpsonline.org.uk.</p><p><a name="06110617000121"></a>Registrations
with the MPS have increased by145 per cent since this
agreement was signed and this has contributed to a 5.6 per cent
reduction in the amount of direct mail produced per annum. The DMA is
also currently working on developing a more comprehensive opt-out
scheme for unaddressed mail as part of the voluntary agreement and
hopes to implement this service in the near future. Apart from
increasing the recycling rate of direct mail, the DMA has committed to
reducing the environmental impact of direct mail in several other ways.
For example, it has agreed to increase the use of recycled paper in
direct mail and to avoid using materials such as certain adhesives
which contaminate the recycling
process.</p><p><a name="06110617000122"></a>There have been no
estimates of whether volumes of direct mail will increase as a result
of Royal Mail's decision to remove the limit on the amount of junk mail
that can be delivered through its service. It should be noted that this
is a decision by Royal Mail and there are a number of other postal
operators that deliver direct mail which do not set any limits on how
much direct mail can be delivered. However, members of the public can
contact the Royal Mail in orderto opt out of receiving
unsolicited or unaddressed letters and leaflets delivered by them by
e-mailing optout@royalmail.com.</p>

Information on pupils eligible for free school meals is collected at
pupil level in England. Pupils should be recorded as eligible only if a
claim for free school meals has been made by them or on their behalf by
parents and either (a) the relevant authority has confirmed their
eligibility and a free school meal is currently being provided for
them, or (b) the school or the local authority have seen the necessary
documentation (for example, an income support award notice) that
supports their eligibility, and the administration of the free meal is
to follow as a matter of process. It is not known how many pupils could
be eligible but are not submitting a
claim.</p>

<p><a name="06110617000145"></a>Scotland: Information on
the number of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals in
schools in Scotland is derived from the school meal survey

Pupils are recorded as eligible if they are registered for free school
meals, or if the authority knows from other sources that the pupil
would be eligible. There will also be others who would be eligible
about which authorities are
unaware.</p><p><a name="06110617000146"></a>Wales: Information on
pupils eligible for free school meals is collected at pupil level in
Wales. Eligibility depends on receipt (by parent or pupil) of income
support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. Pupils should be
recorded as eligible only if they have claimed free school meals and
(a) the relevant authority has confirmed their eligibility, or (b)
final confirmation of eligibility is still awaited but the school has
seen documents that strongly indicate eligibility (for example an
income support order book) and on the basis of those has commenced
provision of free meals. It is not known how many pupils could be
eligible but are not submitting a
claim.</p><p><a name="06110617000147"></a>Northern Ireland: A pupil
is to be regarded as entitled to free meals only on receipt of
notification from the education and library board, or, in the absence
of such notification, in either of the following
situations:</p>on transfer from another school,
where written confirmation has been received from the previous school
that the pupil has a current free meal entitlement;
orwhere the school already holds
confirmation of current entitlement to free meals in respect of a
sibling of the
pupil.<table border="1"><thead><tr><td class="tabletext"><b align="center"><a name=""></a><I>Maintained

is in the process of preparing a public consultation on the standards
and conditions recommended by UKTAG. Defra is also preparing a partial
regulatory impact assessment on the potential benefits and costs of
these standards if they were used by the Environment Agency in
