<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jacobs </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "81119-01_para0"></a>Whether they are satisfied with the operation of the new regulations which limit the sale of aspirin and other similar products to 32 tablets at one time without the express agreement of a pharmacist.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="81119-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Health   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, the new regulations which took effect on 16th September this year restrict the sale of aspirin and paracetamol products to packs of 16 tablets or capsules for general sale and to packs of up to 32 where sale or supply is under the supervision of a pharmacist. When the pharmacist judges it appropriate, for patients with long-term or recurrent conditions up to 100 tablets can be provided. The operation of the new regulations will be monitored and kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer, but is she aware that 1 million people or more a day are taking 75-milligram aspirins--that is, quarter-strength--to prevent heart disease and strokes? Will the Minister consider ending the regulations in respect of those tablets because the present situation causes people to visit the pharmacy 12 times a year? In addition, they are obliged to pay 50 per cent. more than before.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119-01_para1"></a>Finally, is the Minister also aware that it is possible to go into supermarkets and purchase 100 paracetamol or 100 aspirin tablets which are outside the regulations? Is she able to do something about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has asked a number of questions. The pack-size of aspirin and paracetamol products is limited. Those on sale in supermarkets have to be in packs of "only up to 16" and I know that some supermarkets are very careful about the number of packs that can be sold. That is in answer to the last point that the noble Lord raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119-01_para2"></a>On the noble Lord's first point about the public health benefits of low-dose aspirin, we certainly recognise those. We also recognise the difficulties caused for some patients by low-dose aspirin being limited in terms of numbers. However, I should point out that the limit is 100 when the pharmacist sees the patient as having a specific need.
<P>


<a name="column_1364"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "81119-01_para3"></a>The issue about the 75-milligram aspirin is one that we take seriously. Obviously, we were addressing the higher-strength tablets and I shall ask the Medicines Control Agency to look at that specific area to see whether any change may be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, although it is a minor inconvenience for those, like myself, who take aspirin each morning for the reasons that the noble Lord has mentioned, does not the Minister agree that in the case of paracetamol one of the principal reasons for reducing the pack size is that there has been an unfortunate tendency in recent years for people to buy large numbers of paracetamol tablets for suicide attempts? Does the Minister agree that that seems to override the restrictions, or to make valid the restrictions that have been imposed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for those comments and questions. It is important not to lose sight of the reasons behind the decision and the regulations. Paracetamol can do very grave damage. We estimate that there are between 100 and 150 deaths a year from paracetamol poisoning through overdose. It is the commonest reason for liver transplants in this country. With young people in particular it is often the cause of an impulsive rather than a well-considered bid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that far more people are advised to take an aspirin a day than to take any paracetamol? Is it not an unnecessary addition to the cost of the National Health Service that those people should have to see their doctor about once a month in order to renew their prescriptions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that it is possible that there will be additional costs on the National Health Service and that there is some inconvenience to patients. However, as I pointed out, pharmacists are able to prescribe up to 100 paracetamol. We have to balance the issues very carefully. They include the question of the overwhelming National Health Service expenditure as well as the tragic personal and health consequences for many people through paracetamol overdose and, indeed, aspirin overdose. If aspirin were to become the drug of choice rather than paracetamol, overdoses would be even more difficult to treat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, we accept the reasons that the Minister has given for the regulations, but is she aware of the ease with which anyone who wishes to take an overdose can obtain extra tablets by moving from one chemist to another? You can do that in any high street. You can get 100 tablets in four packets--or rather, 128 in four packets. Is there not an element of increased profit for retailers in the regulations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I know that there have been concerns about price increases for such products which perhaps cannot be justified by the simple fact of different packaging being necessary for the <P>


<a name="column_1365"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>smaller packs. I appreciate what my noble friend says about the ability to buy several packs. However, perhaps I may repeat that the evidence about suicide shows clearly that many attempts, particularly by young people, are impulsive attempts, using products in the medicine cupboard at home. One study in Oxford pointed out that 63 per cent. of those who used paracetamol did so because it was readily available and that 41 per cent. of the patients involved had considered overdosing seriously for less than one hour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the new regulations raise the minimum retail price of a single tablet by between 67 and 105 per cent., which is equivalent to perhaps &#163;5 per year for somebody who takes a tablet a day? As I have seen medical evidence which demonstrates that as few as 15 paracetamol tablets can kill, is not this an example of the nanny state run mad, and is it not almost as silly as the beef-on-the-bone ban?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that trying to prevent the deaths of between 100 and 150 people a year is the "nanny state run mad". It is responsible public health policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119-01_para4"></a>Pricing is an issue of concern. There are variations in the pricing and I would very much recommend people to shop around, because not all suppliers have increased the price of their tablets in the same way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   My Lords, as one who takes a junior aspirin every morning in the hope of avoiding a heart attack as a result of the excitement of the proceedings in your Lordships' House, may I ask the Minister whether the Government have any figures for the number of people who set about trying to do themselves harm by taking junior aspirin?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that many people set about trying to do themselves harm by taking junior aspirin. I tried to give the House some figures about the number of people who succeed in doing themselves harm by taking overdoses of paracetamol and aspirin. I recognise the point that has been made about junior aspirin. This is a less simple concept than the noble Lord might think because applications to prevent heart attacks include higher strength aspirins as well as junior aspirins. As I said, this is an area in which there are legitimate concerns and I shall look into the matter.

<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Quirk </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "81119-01_para5"></a>Whether they are satisfied that primary care group boards are so structured as to make proper use of the skills and knowledge of pharmacists.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="81119-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, primary care groups will need to work with a wide range of professionals in <P>


<a name="column_1366"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order to take advantage of their skills and expertise for the benefit of patients. The membership and size of a PCG board has to be manageable and workable. We value highly the skills and knowledge of pharmacists. We made it clear in guidance issued in the summer that they are among the professional groups which PCGs will have the power to co-opt on to a board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer and I note carefully what she has said. Does she not agree that the 12,000 or so pharmacies up and down the country provide our most direct access to healthcare; that they are the first port of call in time of sickness, especially for the poorest in our society; and that in the process they reduce the pressure on GPs' surgeries? Is the Minister aware that graduates of the English schools of pharmacy--from the biggest in Bradford to the oldest in London--are very keen to show that their skills can contribute significantly both operationally and strategically to primary care groups, as they already do with the analogous structures in Wales and in Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Yes, my Lords. I echo some of the noble Lord's remarks about the contribution that the skills of, particularly, community pharmacies can make to people's health and their importance in terms of providing a very local and accessible service. That is why we made it clear in our guidance in the summer that they should be involved as far as possible. That is because a great deal of the work of primary care groups will depend on good prescribing advice and support from professionals such as pharmacists.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many local pharmacies are considering closing as a result of workload, competition from supermarkets and particularly cash-flow problems? Do the Government plan to revise the payment system for local pharmacies as part of their forthcoming community pharmacy strategy? Will the Minister confirm whether the Crown report on prescribing will be published at the same time as that community pharmacy strategy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct that we are currently looking at our community pharmacy strategy. That should build on the contribution that pharmacists can make. We have received a great many suggestions and comments on that. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State had a useful round-table meeting to discuss it. We now need to consider the contributions that have been made and to publish the strategy in due course. I do not think that I can make a commitment that the Crown report will be published at the same time. It might well be in advance of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister think it rather unbalanced to have between four and seven doctors on such groups but not one pharmacist or dentist? As a member of a former family <P>


<a name="column_1367"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>health services authority, does not the Minister agree that those bodies were far more balanced and democratic?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, there is a difficulty here in terms of getting the balance right. The skills and expertise of many professional groups will be needed if primary care groups are to function effectively. That is why we have included powers of co-option--to balance against the need also to have a manageable and workable core membership. In specific areas, primary care groups have the ability to set up executive sub-groups, which it might well be appropriate for a co-opted member such as a pharmacist to lead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Uddin: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister tell the House how it is intended to monitor the structure of primary care group boards to ensure that they reflect the equal opportunities commitment that we have made for the health service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the health service is committed to effective implementation of equal opportunities. I believe that it has done a great deal in terms of appointments made to trust boards and health authorities during the time of this Government. The primary care group will be a sub-committee of the health authority and I expect it to monitor equal opportunities among the membership, as it does other areas of its work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, why is it that pharmacists are to be included automatically in primary care group boards in Wales and Scotland but not in England?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl will be aware from the many debates in this House that it is possible to hold different views about the appropriate structures for different parts of the United Kingdom. That is very much the outcome of the legislation that has been debated in this Session. As far as concerns England, as promised in the White Paper, the Government believe that doctors and nurses should be very much in the driving seat and that other appropriate professionals, be they occupational therapists, physiotherapists, midwives or pharmacists, should be brought in to make their contribution as and when appropriate.

<P>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contracts under the general wind bands in the fourth Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation Renewables Order. In addition, the Government are working with the British wind industry and others to see how the UK's offshore wind resource can best be developed in order to contribute significantly to the UK's electricity supply from renewables. To this end the Government have issued a consultation document on possible arrangements for incorporating the development of offshore wind energy into a specific offshore wind band in the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation Order process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his reply. In view of the Government's commitment to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by certain dates, might this renewable source of energy, taking full account of the needs of navigation, be preferable to wind farms on land, which give rise to many objections? There is plenty of wind around the coasts of Britain, especially Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not comment on where wind is most prevalent in the British Isles. A 10 per cent. contribution to UK electricity supplies from renewals by the year 2010 will require the use of four main technologies: onshore wind, offshore wind, waste such as landfill gas and energy crops. Therefore, as we begin to harness offshore wind, we will need a significant contribution from onshore wind at the same time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are anxious to have a large offshore wind farm, have they considered undertaking a feasibility study to establish one on the Dogger Bank?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, at the moment a review is looking at all of the possible sources of offshore wind production. I am sure that that review will also consider the point just raised by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that while the wind power that has been mentioned is welcome, the most important factor in electricity generation is the state of the British coal industry? Can the Minister say whether further help is to be given to the industry, particularly as productivity has increased out of all recognition and also because it is the cheapest form of energy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is true that renewable energy still represents a very small proportion of total electricity supply. In total it is about 2 per cent., half of which comes from large-scale hydro. Coal still represents 37 per cent. The health of the coal industry <P>


<a name="column_1369"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remains very important. On a marginal basis it is true that coal is often the cheapest but on a long-term basis gas is cheaper.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say whether the possibility of energy from wave power has been eliminated altogether?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we must also look to the future. While it is a very small proportion at this stage, in terms of security of supply it is sensible to look to the long term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as vice-president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales. Can my noble friend confirm that any onshore wind energy arrangements will be subject to the most rigorous planning permission and will not obscure the delightful hills of rural Wales?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we monitor the planning applications. This reveals that, broadly speaking, 50 per cent. of wind farm applications are granted and about 50 per cent. are refused. There is no evidence that local planning authorities either disregard advice that is given by PPG.22 or fall prey to concerted lobbying groups with a particular interest in the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that in order to meet only three-quarters of the 10 per cent. renewables target, 9,000 wind generators will be required--rather more than the 2,000 suggested by Mr. Meacher in Buenos Aires?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is true that to provide a substantial amount of wind energy will require a large number of turbines. I do not have the exact figures with me, and I shall certainly write to the noble Earl when I have them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord give an indication of the current cost of producing electricity from offshore wind energy? I have heard estimates of between 5 and 6p. per kilowatt hour to be compared with 2.5p. from conventional sources. If that or anything like it is correct, how do the Government propose to close the gap?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is extremely interesting to look at the pattern of prices over successive NFFO rounds of agreement. It has come down from 7.98p. at NFFO -1 to 2.88p. These are large wind band contract prices. One can see that it is beginning to become economical.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="81119-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government want to see a successful conclusion to the European Union/South Africa Trade, Development and Co-operation Agreement by the end of this year. Talks are continuing at official level between the European Commission and South Africa this week. Indeed, they are taking place at this very moment. We believe that the basis of a deal on trade is now on the table. Alec Erwin, the South African Trade and Industry Minister, said in London on Monday last that he believed that if European Union member states could back the outline deal that he and Commissioner Pinheiro discussed in October agreement was in sight. We are closely involved in the negotiations to help resolve the remaining difficulties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord St. John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that encouraging Answer. Is he aware that the negotiations between the South African Government and the European Commission have taken more than four years, raising concerns of EU protectionism in the agricultural sector? At a time of high and growing unemployment in South Africa, with a labour intensive agricultural sector, can the Government put pressure on the European Commission in more onerous terms to stop putting further obstacles in the way before such an agreement can be reached?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, to be precise, the present negotiations are taking place on a <P>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column 1371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mandate from the General Affairs Council to the Commission in March 1996. But the noble Lord is right. We are extremely keen to see that the negotiations are carried to a rapid and successful conclusion. We very much hope that it will be possible for decisions to be made at the General Affairs Council on 7th December.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what bilateral discussions are taking place? If not, will he take better action with some of our southern partners who seem to have taken the most ridiculous nitpicking attitude towards a free trade agreement, which is absolutely essential if the United Kingdom and the European Union are to retain their credibility as a free trading area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the amount of lobbying that has taken place, even during the Austrian presidency, is amazing. The lobbying by this country has involved the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and junior Ministers. They have lobbied the President of the European Commission, the Austrian presidency and the individual member states which are concerned. In addition to those political contacts, there have been incessant official contacts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the package put by Mr. Pinheiro in October was acceptable to the South African Government, who were prepared to sign on the dotted line, since when different elements within the Commission have tried to unpick that agreement? Does he recall the ringing tones of support for South Africa following its establishment of a democratic government? There were ringing cries of friendship. Will the Minister accept that the Commission's behaviour reminds one of an old Scottish saying, "Touch my pocket and friendship's out"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, all of us are disappointed that since South Africa has escaped from apartheid we have not been able to achieve a free trade agreement. My noble friend is right, as I indicated in my Answer, that the outline agreement which was on the table between Commissioner Pinheiro and South Africa would have been acceptable to South Africa. However, the Commission is still operating on a mandate from the General Affairs Council and member states still have to be involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the terms which have been set out in the free trade agreement could be likely to lead to high-scale unemployment in the agricultural sector, which is the one area still open to unskilled labour in South Africa?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, no, I do not agree. The terms set out will cover agriculture, in particular fruit, which is the most important South African export. I accept that the noble Lord is right in linking agriculture in South Africa with employment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, on this last day of the Session, perhaps I may say to the Minister that I am sure the Government are genuine in their desire to see agreement reached with South Africa. However, does he not appreciate that unless the Government go to Brussels and confront the Commission head on with the problem that is at the centre of the issue, there is still a residual agricultural protectionism? Unless that is resolved, frankly, it does not matter how keen the Government are to settle the matter and achieve an agreement; that will not be the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government are doing exactly what the noble and learned Lord described. We are at this very moment in Brussels engaged in negotiations with the European Commission in order to try to overcome the difficulties he describes. We are totally on the same side on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it is particularly important to put pressure on Portugal and Spain to stop holding these negotiations hostage with their ridiculous vendetta against South Africa for calling its fortified wines "sherry" and "port"? That has been happening for more than 200 years. As a matter of fact, all the wines and spirits from South Africa account for only 0.5 per cent. of the European Union's imports from South Africa.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, sherry and port represent a widespread problem which my noble friend will recognise. For example, champagne producers have succeeded in stopping anyone else anywhere in the world calling anything produced by the methode champenoise champagne. The difficulty extends to sherry and port, too. Australia has agreed to stop producing "sherry" and "port", but with a long derogation period. That may be the solution for sherry and port from South Africa.

<A NAME = "81119-04_para6"></a>"In Northern Ireland, my Government have continued to work towards peace, stability and reconciliation. Their efforts to promote a comprehensive political settlement contributed to the agreement reached in the multi-party talks. They have moved speedily to implement that agreement, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum. They have continued to foster the improvement of economic and social conditions through inward investment and other means. New measures for tackling terrorism have been introduced following the Omagh bombing.

<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  I issued a discussion paper in February 1998 and have concluded in the light of the responses that the civil court fee structure will be based on the following key principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para5"></a>Court fees should not act as a barrier to access to justice. Litigants should not expect the taxpayer to pay for the court services they use, if they can afford to do so themselves. We shall continue to provide protection for the less well-off through a system of exemptions
and remissions. In addition, fees for Children Act applications, adoptions, and domestic violence injunctions will be subsidised by the taxpayer. All other fees will be set to recover the full cost of the service provided.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para6"></a>Fees will broadly match the cost of the service for which they are charged. Within civil proceedings, fees payable on issuing a claim will be banded according to the value of the claim and will still be used to defray the bulk of the cost of proceedings. Litigants will pay fees which match the average cost of the service for <P>


<a name="column_WA176"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column WA176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which they are charged, rather than the specific cost of their particular case. Fees will be paid by the claimant, or where a specific application has been made, by the applicant, and will be paid in advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para7"></a>A structure based on these principles will be fairer than the present one. It will encourage and enable litigants to make responsible choices about whether to proceed, while ensuring that the taxpayer's contribution is clearly targeted on the people who really need it.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para8"></a>The Court Service is publishing a consultation paper today on the charging points and the levels at which fees should be set. The paper, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House, includes proposals that separate fees will be set for the main stages of the new civil procedures, introducing charging points at allocation and listing.

<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para10"></a>My honourable friend the Minister of State of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has decided not to finance research into the use of snares.

<A NAME="81119w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  Most cases of Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) 0157:H7 infection are either sporadic or associated with family or household incidents. Details of the suspected sources of infection associated with such incidents are not routinely reported. As part of ongoing surveillance of outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease in England and Wales, 31 of the 55 general outbreaks of VTEC 0157:H7 reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre between 1992 and 1997 were found to have a foodborne route of transmission. In Northern Ireland, no general outbreaks of VTEC 0157:H7 associated with beef, dairy, sheep or pig products have been reported.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para11"></a>In England and Wales a survey in 1995 of bovine faeces samples routinely submitted for diagnostic purposes to veterinary investigation centres found VTEC 0157:H7 in 0.86 per cent. of 6,495 samples. No association with season or herd type (beef or dairy) could be found. No surveys have been carried out on samples from sheep or pigs. Examination of faeces sampled from livestock submitted over a year between April 1995 and March 1996 to a single abattoir showed that almost 15.7 per cent. of cattle and 2.2 per cent. of sheep were excreting VTEC 0157. The same research project identified non-toxigenic E.coli 0157 in 0.14 per cent. of pigs, but this would be unlikely to be a source of infection for man.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para12"></a>In Scotland a study during 1991 to 1995 of cattle faeces samples submitted to Scottish agricultural colleges veterinary investigation centres demonstrated a prevalence of 0.27 per cent. (14 positive from 5,273 sampled).

The prevalence of 0157 was 2.2 per cent. (11 positives from 508 samples). While this survey was going on, a survey on carcasses in the nine principal abattoirs was carried out. E.coli 0157 was not detected in the 780 specimens examined. As part of an investigation into the microbiological quality of cattle carcasses in abattoirs, the level of 0157 contamination was ascertained on 210 faecal samples.

<A NAME = "81119w01_para14"></a>Because VTEC 0157 is not considered to cause significant disease in animals, it is not routinely looked for in samples sent to VI Centres for diagnostic purposes. However, surveys at abattoirs throughout Great Britain are being planned to monitor the prevalence of VTEC 0157:H7 in rectal contents of cattle, sheep and, in association with the industry, pigs. A longitudinal study of faecal excretion of VTEC 0157:H7 in cattle to determine epidemiological patterns is also in preparation and will provide information on how the infection is spread. In addition, SOAEFD is currently funding a prevalence study in fattening cattle in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w01_para15"></a>VTEC 0157 is able to survive for long periods in the environment. It has been isolated from a number of livestock species, wild animals and birds. On farm, cattle are considered to be a main reservoir of infection but current knowledge of the epidemiology of the organism is limited and further research is being funded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   From 5 January 1999 it will be a condition of UK fishing vessel licences that at least four hours notice must be given of all landings of whitefish and shellfish by vessels of 20m overall length and above. Landings (discharge of catches) must then be completed within four hours unless otherwise authorised. These requirements will not, however, apply where landings are made into designated ports during specified hours provided the master or his representative submits a copy of a completed logsheet prior to the discharge of catch taking place. The designated ports will be those set out in the consultation paper issued last March, although for a number of ports the specified hours of landing have been changed in response to representations received. Prior notification is already required for the landing of the main pelagic species and this will continue to operate.

This will regularise the position following advice which has cast doubt on the SFIA's view that its powers to charge contained in the Act covered the technical charges which were levied up until 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w02_para3"></a>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary believes that the charges levied were reasonable ones and that the costs of making repayments would be disproportionate to any benefit such repayment would confer on those to whom it was made.

However, legislative proposals are monitored with a view to considering whether analogous legislation should be brought forward for Northern Ireland by way of Order in Council. In 1976 the view was apparently that the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 should not be copied into Northern Ireland law, but I regret to say that the reasons why are not clear.

<P>

<A NAME = "81119w02_para5"></a>The Dangerous Wild Animals Act is concerned with the public safety and animal welfare aspects of the keeping of wild animals and, therefore, the absence of its provisions in NI has no direct implications for their sale. The controls on the sale of wild animals in Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, are contained in EC Regulations 338/97, 938/97 and 939/97 which implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

<A NAME="81119w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty): </B>  Following consideration of the results of the public consultation I have decided that the existing powers of school crossing patrols should be enhanced by allowing them to cross children of any age along with any adults who may wish to use the facility. The existing time limits on when crossings may operate will also be removed. These proposals were supported by a large majority of those who responded to the consultation.

<A NAME="81119w04_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How widely the Ministry of Defence's helpline and advice unit for the ex-Service community has been publicised; how many requests for guidance and help have so far been received; and what range of problems has been dealt with.[HL3808]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  The Veterans' Advice Unit was launched by the Minister of State for the Armed Forces on Monday 5 October in the presence of the media. A full information pack and press release for the launch was distributed to the national and regional media. The telephone number, 08456 02 03 02, which charges callers at local rates, is listed in all telephone directories under "Ministry of Defence Veterans' Advice Unit."
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para0"></a>Since its launch, some 80,000 leaflets publicising the unit have been distributed through Resettlement Offices, the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations, COBSEO, The Royal British Legion, SSAFA-Forces Help and other veterans' organisations and charities including the British Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association, BLESMA, the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society, "Combat Stress", and the Regular Forces Employment Association, among others.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para1"></a>The leaflet has been, or is being, sent to DSS benefit offices nation-wide, the War Pensions Agency and Citizens' Advice Bureaux. The "military media" such as Navy News, Soldier magazine, RAF News and the "British Forces Broadcasting Service" have carried items about the Unit. The MoD is continuing to look for ways in which the unit can be publicised.

<A NAME = "81119w04_para2"></a>In the six weeks that the Veterans' Advice Unit has been operational, the unit has taken nearly 1,100 calls. Most calls can be dealt with immediately, but some require investigative work and a subsequent return call to the enquirer.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para3"></a>The range of problems dealt with has been quite diverse, including homecare and housing, Falklands and Gulf war issues, finance, the tracing of relatives, War Graves and historical records, among others. However, the largest number of calls have concerned pensions, employment, the provision of medals and information about the unit itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_wqn3"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many rounds of depleted uranium ammunition were fired by British forces, including tomahawk missiles, tank rounds, and cannon shells fired from aircraft, during Operation Granby; and whether they agree with United States figures that 1,200,000 rounds were fired in total by coalition force.[HL3862]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   During the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, UK armoured forces used a new 120mm armour-piercing tank round which contained a solid depleted uranium, DU, penetrator core with a protective, non-DU, coating in its Challenger 1 tanks. The Government's current assessment is that UK tanks fired fewer than 100 of these rounds against Iraqi military forces, which equates to less than 1 metric tonne of DU, although additional rounds were fired during earlier work-up training to establish the round's mean point of impact.

<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para16"></a>At the time of the Gulf conflict, the Royal Navy was equipped with 20mm ammunition containing DU for its Vulcan Phalanx close-in-weapons-system. This ammunition was not, however, used during the Gulf War, apart from some rounds fired for proving purposes. No other types of ammunition or weapon systems used by UK forces during the Gulf conflict, including missiles or rounds fired from aircraft, contained DU.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para17"></a>On 4 August 1998, the US Department of Defense, DoD, published a detailed "case narrative" entitled "Depleted Uranium in the Gulf", which gave details of the DoD's latest assessment of the quantity of DU-based ammunition used by US forces during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. This assessment shows that over 860,000 DU-based ammunition rounds of varying calibre were used by US forces, containing over 320 US tons, or over 290 metric tonnes, of DU, although it should be noted that, for some categories of ammunition, the data were incomplete or not available. A copy of this case narrative has already been placed in the Library of the House.

<A NAME = "81119w04_para18"></a>So far as we are aware, only UK and US forces used ammunition containing DU during the Gulf conflict. Accordingly, based on current UK and US assessments, the suggested figure of 1,200,000 DU-based ammunition rounds fired overall by coalition forces appears to be an overestimate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_wqn4"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether any modifications were made to British tanks to ensure the safety of their crews when firing depleted uranium ammunition during Operation Granby; and if not, why not.[HL3863]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The main battle tank used by UK forces during the Gulf conflict in 1990-91 was the Challenger 1, armed with the 120mm rifled-barrel
L11 gun. When planning Operation Granby, the MoD assessed that the existing tungsten-based armour-piercing rounds in use with Challenger 1 might not be sufficiently powerful to defeat the most modern Iraqi tanks--Soviet designed T72s. It was, decided therefore, that MoD should undertake the emergency development and deployment of a new armour-piercing round for Challenger 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para19"></a>This new round was based on a 120mm armour-piercing round, which was then being developed for use by the more powerful gun on the new Challenger 2 main battle tank. It contained a solid depleted uranium, DU, penetrator core with a protective, non-DU, coating, and was known as CHARM 1. In fact, the CHARM 1 round needed only minor modifications in order to fit the L11 gun on Challenger 1, but a totally new charge needed to be developed.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para20"></a>In the mid-1980s, measurements to assess the radiation dose rates inside a Chieftain tank loaded with DU-based rounds, and the contamination levels to which tank crews might be exposed, were carried out by the atomic weapons establishment, AWE, at Aldermaston. These measurements showed that there were no reasonably foreseeable circumstances in which tank crews would be likely to receive radiation doses greater <P>


<a name="column_WA193"></a>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column WA193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than the present statutory dose limits for employees aged 18 years and over. These radiation dose rate results were confirmed as being applicable to Challenger 1 tanks during a further trial held in November 1990 by AWE at Royal Ordnance Chorley. In addition, trials were conducted to investigate the possible effects of dropping CHARM 1 rounds on steel plates. These concluded that no DU would be released in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para21"></a>No modifications to Challenger 1 or its L11 gun for safety reasons were, therefore, considered necessary. Clearance for crews to fire the modified CHARM 1 round from Challenger 1 was subsequently confirmed by the Ordnance Board in December 1990.

<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_wqn5"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many British Gulf veterans have been tested for exposure to depleted uranium dust; and whether, in the light of the results of Canadian tests on samples from one British veteran which showed a high titre of depleted uranium, they will ensure that tests are conducted on a routine basis on other British Gulf veterans who may have been exposed to the dust.[HL3864]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   Any Gulf veteran who is concerned that his or her health has been adversely affected by service during the Gulf conflict, including possible exposure to depleted uranium, DU, dust is urged to seek a referral to the Medical Assessment Programme, MAP, for a full medical assessment.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para22"></a>The kidneys are particularly sensitive to the presence of DU and the standard battery of tests carried out as a matter of routine on MAP patients includes a baseline trawl of renal functions, which includes: serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes, urine test for protein and blood and an ultrasound abdominal scan. Such tests should indicate the presence of any current kidney damage in patients, although such damage would not necessarily have been caused by the presence of DU. The standard MAP tests do not, however, include a specific test to detect the presence of DU. Those veterans who have so far been examined by MAP physicians have not exhibited symptoms which, in the clinical judgment of the examining physician, have indicated a requirement for a specific referral to another agency or organisation for DU testing. Thus, no UK Gulf veterans have been specifically tested for the presence of DU as part of the MAP.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w04_para23"></a>In general, the Government have no knowledge of any tests which may have been carried out on Gulf veterans, independently of the MAP, through other organisations providing medical or radiological services. However, the Ministry of Defence is aware that a US physician is reported as having carried out tests in Canada for the presence of DU on some UK Gulf veterans. However, we have not yet seen details of the tests which have been performed or the results obtained. Accordingly, the MoD cannot comment on the physician's reported findings.

This would include a genetically modified virus. MoD is not aware of any medicines, including vaccines, containing genetically modified organisms which were administered to UK troops prior to August 1991, when Operation Granby officially ended. In particular, none of the medical countermeasures used during the Gulf conflict to protect UK troops from Iraqi chemical and biological weapons contained genetically modified organisms.

<A NAME="81119w05_wqn2"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>At what level of detection British CAM and NAIAD alarms were set compared with the level of the lethal doses of the agents they were designed to detect.[HL3837]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The standard Chemical Agent Monitor, CAM, is used to test for the presence of blister and nerve agents: It does not have an alarm facility and is, therefore, not a chemical warfare agent detector. The Nerve Agent Immobilised enzyme Alarm and Detector, NAIAD, is used to give an initial alarm of the potential presence of nerve agents. However, during the Gulf conflict in 1990-91, a CAM Remote Alarm Display Unit, CRADU, and a Field Alarm Module, FAM, based on the CAM, were developed and deployed to provide an additional warning alarm and, thus, a detection capability.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w05_para0"></a>Any warning of the potential presence of chemical warfare agent is followed up by using CAM in standard mode and other testing systems. Warning and detection capabilities are part of the suite of measures used to protect UK Service personnel from the threat posed by chemical weapons.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w05_para1"></a>The effect of a chemical warfare agent depends upon the type of agent involved and the dose which an individual receives. For example, when a chemical warfare agent is in its gaseous phase, the dose received is a product of the concentration of the agent present and the length of time over which the exposure takes place. The levels of dose considered to be first hazardous and then lethal differ for each agent and vary according to the prevailing circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w05_para2"></a>CAM and NAIAD respond to concentrations of chemical warfare agents, not doses. They indicate the potential presence of chemical warfare agent at the lowest possible concentration consistent with the inherent technical limitations of the equipment. These limitations relate to the sensitivity of the equipment to other substances, because these can lead to false alarms. Even so, there remains the potential for CAM and NAIAD, to give false detections that have been caused by such "interferents". For this reason, any apparent detections of chemical warfare agent must be immediately followed up and substantiated by the use of other procedures. The correct use of CAM, in detection mode, and NAIAD should allow personnel to take any necessary protective measures, including the donning of individual protection equipment, before they are exposed to a potentially hazardous dose of chemical warfare agent.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w05_para3"></a>Further information on CAM and NAIAD will be published in the forthcoming report of the review of alleged chemical warfare agent detections by UK troops during the Gulf conflict.

<A NAME="81119w06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Arts Council of England's Fitness for Purpose report is a helpful contribution in informing discussion between my department and the Department for Education and Employment on future arrangements for funding students in dance, drama and stage management. Fitness for Purpose does not refer specifically to dance teacher training, nor should any specific conclusions be drawn from it about the future training of dance teachers.

Mr. Michael Williams of the South-West Maritime Archaeological Group. Among other issues, this letter commented on the operation of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. The noble Lord will be receiving a reply shortly to this correspondence.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w07_para1"></a>It is a criminal offence under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 for any person to engage in certain conduct within a designated area without a licence granted by the relevant Secretary of State. Licences are issued on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites and will stipulate certain conditions to ensure that appropriate archaeological standards are maintained on designated sites. Although responsibility for policing or prosecuting offences under the 1973 Act lies with the relevant police force, my department does provide advice, where necessary, about the provisions of the Act. Steps are being undertaken to ensure that all police forces are aware of their responsibilities under the 1973 Act.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If the grant had been increased in line with the retail prices index since
1991-92, it would now have been worth &#163;240,593. As part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, my department took a strategic look at what could be done to ensure blind and visually impaired people benefit in a much wider way from public library services than they do at present. By allocating the grant to the Library and Information Commission we aim to create a fresh impetus to the provision of library services to the blind and visually impaired people and to provide the opportunity for local authorities to embed these into the mainstream library service. In reaching our conclusion we were aware that the grant supports only a small element of the spending of over &#163;6 million that the Royal National Institute makes on embossed literature. Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act will require public libraries to make adjustments to practices, policies or procedures that make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to make use of their services and my department was aware of this as a possible use of the grant.

<A NAME="81119w07_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  The White Paper No More Excuses set out radical proposals for reform of the youth court, to enable those appearing before the youth court for the first time to be referred, by way of sentence, to a youth offender panel. Following the principles of restorative justice, the panel would draw up a contract with the young offender to include reparation to the victim of the offence or to the wider community, and measures to deal with drug or alcohol abuse, poor parenting or other issues relevant to the offending behaviour. The length of the referral would be determined by the court, on the basis of the seriousness of the crime, up to a maximum of 12 months. The Government invited comments on these proposals and received replies from 97 individuals and organisations. The majority of the respondents were in favour of the proposals.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w07_para3"></a>As suggested in the White Paper, it is intended that the new disposal will be automatic for those appearing for the first time and pleading guilty, save for those occasions where either an absolute discharge or a custodial sentence is considered appropriate. In the light of consultation, it is also proposed to make the disposal available, on a discretionary basis, where the defendant pleads guilty to some offences but not guilty to others; and to give the courts discretion to extend referral orders when dealing with other offences committed before or during the referral period. The White Paper suggested that membership of the youth offender panel be drawn from the magistracy and the police. In the light of consultation, it is proposed that panel members be recruited from members of the community with an experience of young people and crime. This would include magistrates and the police, but on a lay basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w07_para4"></a>Subject to these and other minor amendments to the original White Paper proposals, legislation making provision for this new disposal will be introduced at the earliest opportunity.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The United Kingdom Government and the authorities in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man welcome Andrew Edwards' report on financial regulation, which has been laid before Parliament today. Copies of the report are being placed in the Library and the Printed Paper Office. The report, which has been produced in consultation with the Islands, contains detailed accounts of the legislation and regulatory arrangements on Jersey, Guernsey and
the Isle of Man respectively. It confirms that the arrangements in place conform in large measure to the internationally accepted standards of financial regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w08_para0"></a>The report also concludes that there are a number of changes which could raise standards still further, both in the United Kingdom itself and in the Crown Dependencies. In many cases, these conclusions are in line with policies which are already being developed. The United Kingdom Government and the Island authorities have agreed to meet in January 1999 to begin the task of examining systematically the conclusions of the Edwards report and the plans of action being drawn up by the Islands and the United Kingdom in response to those conclusions. This programme will include new arrangements, under my chairmanship, for all the parties to meet jointly on a regular basis to take stock of progress. These meetings will take place alternately in London and in one of the Crown Dependencies.

<A NAME="81119w09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Prior to
24 July 1998, there was no general requirement for Foreign Office officials to record contacts with private military companies. It would be impossible to list meetings prior to this date with accuracy. However, as far as we have been able to ascertain, the following contacts took place. As noted in paragraphs 5.25 and 5.31 of the Legg Report, the British High Commissioner in Sierra Leone met Lt. Col. Spicer on 23 December 1997 and on 23 January 1998, on each occasion for about one hour. On 19 January 1998, officials dealing with Sierra Leone met Lt. Col. Spicer for approximately 40 minutes. On 17 July, officials dealing with drugs and international crime met Lt. Col. Spicer for about 45 minutes. This meeting was held to warn Sandline about the character of one of their contacts in Russia.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w09_para1"></a>Since 24 July, Foreign Office officials have been required to record all contacts with private military companies. On 22 September 1998, officials met
Lt. Col. Spicer for about 45 minutes. This meeting was held in order to make clear to him the terms of UNSCR 1160, the Order in Council giving effect to this SCR and the EU Common Position of 19 March 1998 covering the supply of arms to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The most recent contacts with Lt. Col. Spicer have been in relation to a consular case in Angola.

Belated action at this sensitive stage of the peace process would be counter productive. But our position on settlements is clear and well known to the Israelis. Settlements in the Occupied Territories and East Jerusalem are illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace. The Israeli Cabinet ratified the Wye River Memorandum on 11 November. We expect Israel to abide by the letter and spirit of this agreement and refrain from any unilateral or provocative acts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The standard clause on human rights is an important part of an EU Association Agreement. It requires relations between the parties of the agreement to be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights. A future agreement with Algeria would necessarily follow this model. The Government supports the EU's commitment to furthering political dialogue with Algeria as a way of contributing to an improvement in the situation there.

GENERAL AFFAIRS COUNCIL, BRUSSELS, 9-10 NOVEMBER 1998: INSPIRED PQ
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para0"></a>The General Affairs Council in Brussels on 9-10 November adopted the A points listed in document 12595/98 and noted the resolutions, decisions and opinions adopted by the European Parliament in its <P>

<B>19 Nov 1998 : Column WA216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>session of 19 October to 23 October and listed in document 11727/98. Copies of the documents listing the A points and resolutions will be placed in the House Libraries as soon as they become available.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para1"></a>On 10 November the EU held successful ministerial meetings of the Accession Conferences with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Conferences opened substantive negotiations at ministerial level and marked another milestone in the accession process. Association Councils with Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were also held on 10 November.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para2"></a>The GAC reviewed progress in the Agenda 2000 negotiation. Many member states called for an increase in the pace of negotiation, in particular on the common agricultural policy. The Foreign Secretary called for more progress on CAP reform. Subject to the general rule that no element in the package can be agreed finally until there is agreement on the package as a whole, there was widespread agreement in principle to the Commission's draft pre-accession instruments, though Spain maintained a reserve. The Presidency said that there would be a conclave of Foreign Ministers on 6 December. There was also discussion of a number of detailed aspects of structural funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para3"></a>The Commission presented its progress reports on
the candidate countries, in advance of discussion at the Vienna European Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para4"></a>The Council discussed the humanitarian situation in Russia and agreed that, should Russia formally request food aid from the EU, the Council would examine urgently a Commission proposal on that basis. The Council will discuss a further report on EU policy and assistance to Russia at the 7 December GAC.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para5"></a>The Commission presented two draft regulations on funding the European Strategy for Turkey. The Presidency remitted the proposals for further discussion in Coreper.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para6"></a>The Commission explained progress on the EU/Switzerland negotiations. Ministers urged continued efforts by both sides towards early agreement. The
7 December General Affairs Council may consider this further.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para7"></a>Ministers had an exchange of views on the Middle East Peace Process with EU Special Envoy Miguel Moratinos present, following the Wye River Memorandum. They underlined the importance of the speedy implementation of the Memorandum, the need to avoid unilateral acts, and the need for progress on all tracks of the peace process. The Council condemned in the strongest terms the recent acts of terrorism and urged the parties to do their utmost both to forestall extremist actions and to deny success to extremists seeking by provocation to frustrate the peace process. Ministers also confirmed EU support for a significant political and economic EU contribution to the implementation of the Wye Memorandum.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para8"></a>On Kosovo, the Council reiterated its expectation that all parties, the FRY security forces and the armed Kosovo Albanian groups, comply fully with recent UN Security Council resolutions. It repeated its support for the Kosovo Verification Mission, which should be fully <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>operational as soon as possible, and underlined the need for an early start to political negotiations, with the EU's active involvement. It also condemned the action taken by the FRY authorities to prevent the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, and her team from fulfilling their mission in Kosovo, as well as their recent crackdown on the independent media.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para9"></a>The Council emphasised the EU's continued commitment to support Albania. It welcomed the successful holding of the International Conference in Tirana on 30 October. The Council repeated the call in the EU's recent declaration to the Democratic Party to participate in the 22 November referendum on the constitution. It welcomed the WEU recommendations on assistance to ensure a viable police force in Albania and confirmed the Union's intention to reinforce its contribution to the re-establishment of such a force.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para10"></a>The Council reviewed the continuing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its implications for the stability of the Great Lakes region. It agreed that the immediate priorities were the cessation of hostilities; the withdrawal of foreign troops; and all-party negotiations aimed at achieving a political settlement as soon as possible. It stressed the need to respect human rights and humanitarian law. It instructed officials to recommend how the EU could help further, in particular to stem the trafficking in small arms in the region.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w10_para11"></a>At the UK's request, Ministers discussed the situation in Iraq and agreed a declaration emphasising support for UNSCR 1205 and condemning as totally unacceptable Iraq's decision to cease co-operation with UNSCOM.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely. We regard settlement activity in the Occupied Territories and East Jerusalem as illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace. The US has also said it regards settlement activity as unhelpful to the peace process.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   In recognition of the progress being made towards respect for human rights and the restoration of a democratic civilian government in Nigeria, on 1 November the EU adopted a new Common Position, replacing the Common Positions of 20 November 1995 and 4 December 1995. The UK was at the forefront of those advocating this change of policy. As a result the following measures have now been lifted: all visa restrictions; the ban on high level visits; the ban on sporting contacts; the ban on the appointment of European military personnel to diplomatic missions in Nigeria and Nigerian military personnel in the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w11_para0"></a>The following measures continue to apply: suspension of military co-operation; cancellation of training courses for all Nigerian military personnel, except for non-combative courses to encourage respect for human rights and to prepare the military for the democratic control by a civilian government of the armed forces; an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment. A dialogue on development co-operation may now be resumed with a view to re-engagement after the installation of a democratically elected civilian government.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w11_para1"></a>The European Union also re-affirmed its willingness to strengthen a constructive dialogue with Nigeria and to support the electoral process. It also reiterated its support for Nigeria's regional peacekeeping activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w11_para2"></a>The new Common Position will be reviewed no later than 1 June 1999. Should there be any deterioration in the <P>

<P>
<UL>Whether the United Kingdom will continue to impose an arms embargo on Nigeria, in line with the European Union's Common Position on 1 November.[HL3921]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="81119w11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Her Majesty's Government will continue to implement rigorously the EU arms embargo against Nigeria. The UK interprets this as covering all goods and technology on the UK Military List which forms Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods Order 1994, as amended.
<P>

<A NAME = "81119w11_para4"></a>Following consultations with this department and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved, as an exception, a licence for the export of three military listed protected vehicles for use by the Central Bank of Nigeria for the escort of currency. This licence is being granted to permit a civilian end user to meet legitimate security needs and is consistent with the purpose of the embargo.
