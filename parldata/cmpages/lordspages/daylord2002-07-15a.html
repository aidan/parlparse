<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in view of the growing number of crimes committed by children too young to be brought before the courts, they have any plans to reduce the age of criminal responsibility.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is currently 10 and Her Majesty's Government have no plans to reduce it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Does he agree that age is not necessarily an accurate basis for distinguishing between right and wrong? Is it possible that a spate of youth crime may start at a younger age?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree that age is not necessarily the right dividing line for those who can determine between right and wrong, but an age of criminal responsibility is needed. I accept that in certain places there are those, under the age of 10, who commit crimes and antisocial behaviour. I do not believe that the correct way to deal with them is to reduce the age of criminal responsibility. Our age of criminal responsibility is one of the lowest in Europe. I believe that Scotland is the only country that has a lower age and it has been advised by the Law Commission that it should be increased to 12. The right course is to intervene as early as possible to try to prevent people going down the path of crime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that the Minister accepts that our age of criminal responsibility is one of the lowest in Western Europe. Does the Minister also accept that the best way to deal with children is to adopt the practices used in many European countries where children are dealt with in family courts where supervision and care are more of a concern than any criminal process? Would such a process help to reduce crime?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, when a child under the age of 10 is drawn to the attention of the authorities for committing antisocial behaviour or a crime, he or she is treated as a child in need under the 1988 Act and social services consider the correct course for that child. I wholly agree that in relation to a child under 10 all steps should be taken to consider <P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what is the best way to divert him or her from a life of crime. When a child is 10 or older, difficult decisions have to be made about the extent to which criminal proceedings are appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the most effective ways of reducing juvenile crime at whatever age is to ensure extra support early enough for families in the most deprived areas? Does he further agree that nipping the very first signs of truancy in the bud is a necessary part of the equation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I wholly agree that the best possible support should be provided to prevent children turning to crime at any age. I fully accept the basis of the noble Baroness's question. First, I draw her attention to the Sure Start programme, which seeks to achieve that and, secondly, to the Government's focus on seeking to ensure, for example, that children who are excluded from school nevertheless receive full-time education. All of us know the close connection between exclusion from school and the commission of crime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, while accepting the answers given so far by my noble and learned friend, does he agree that there may be some justification for increasing the degree of responsibility and perhaps punishment for adults who may influence young children to commit crimes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, indeed. All too often one hears of occasions when children and parents are engaged together in shoplifting activities. One should come down as hard as possible on parents who urge their children to commit criminal offences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House the legal position of children who, according to recent truancy reports, are encouraged to stay away from school in order to engage in shoplifting?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the legal position depends on the age of the child, but if a parent incites a child who is over the age of criminal responsibility to commit a criminal offence, that is the crime of incitement. As the noble Viscount will know, the Government have been keen to ensure that the strictest possible measures are taken by courts in dealing with parents who do not ensure that their children attend school when they can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Stern: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that treating troubled and damaged young children as criminals makes them more troubled and damaged? Section 130 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 has allowed many more children on remand to be locked up in secure places which are overcrowded and an experiment, to be conducted in 10 areas, is to be rolled out in September of this year. In the light of the large numbers of young children who have been locked <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>up under that section, does he agree that the implementation of the section throughout the country should be postponed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I do not agree with the last proposal. Difficult decisions have to be made about children who are above the age of criminal responsibility in relation to crimes that they commit. Where, for example, crimes such as street robbery are on the increase, it is necessary for judgments to be made as to how best to protect the community. That does not mean that where it is appropriate for an individual child to be given help rather than to undergo criminal proceedings, that that should not be provided, because that would help to reduce re-offending. However, it is not a one-way street. The protection of the community also has to be considered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I thought that we were dealing with children under the age of criminal responsibility. If that is the case, would it be possible to introduce, without criminalisation, a way in which magistrates could make an effective order that social services would have to implement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the question is indeed about the criminal age of responsibility. As I indicated before in answer to an earlier question, where a child comes to the attention of the authorities because it has committed an act of antisocial behaviour or a crime, that child is treated as a child in need and the social services investigate the correct course to pursue. That is better than bringing the child before the court in every case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that England has the lowest age of criminal responsibility and that Scotland is being advised to raise the age there to 12. Is the Minister considering raising the age of criminal responsibility in England?
<P>

<a name="20715-01_para0"></a>Given the success of parenting orders and the need that many of these children have for clear boundaries, does the Minister hope that some of the money that the Chancellor is today investing in schools will go to better parenting education in schools so that students leaving school will be better equipped to manage family life?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I thoroughly support the underlying sentiment of the second part of the question; namely, that money spent on parenting orders and on helping people to understand their responsibilities as parents is money well spent. But it is not for me to determine how the education budget should be spent.
<P>

<a name="20715-01_para1"></a>As to the first part of the question about whether we are thinking of increasing the age of criminal responsibility, as I made clear in Answer to the Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, we are not.

<A NAME="20715-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What decisions were reached at the G8 Summit in Canada about the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NePAD) and in particular Zimbabwe.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, at the G8 summit leaders welcomed the initiative taken by African leaders in adopting the New Partnership for Africa's Development. They agreed to build a new way of working together, focusing especially on those countries that demonstrate commitment to good governance, that invest in their people and that pursue policies that spur economic growth and alleviate poverty. There are no specific references to Zimbabwe in the G8 Action Plan for Africa. But it makes clear commitments to respond to NePAD efforts to improve governance across Africa.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Can she assure the House that the Commonwealth initiative at the African Union meeting in Duban last week is not a road to compromise on its previous decision to suspend? Considering that Zimbabwe was suspended because of a fraudulent presidential election, can she assure the House that the Government will not support any move to remove the suspension until a free and fair election is held?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, as I understand the situation, there are parallel initiatives. Noble Lords will know that the governments of South Africa and Nigeria sought to facilitate dialogue between the two political parties in Zimbabwe. Commonwealth leaders suspended Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth. It is suspended for one year. That remains the position. The UK Government supports it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, many international gatherings are considering Zimbabwe, and the situation gets worse. Bearing in mind that Mr Mugabe is a member of the Roman Catholic Church&#151;I am not sure of what standing&#151;does the Minister agree that it may be opportune for Her Majesty's Government and to the world community to ask the Vatican to intercede in this great tragedy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, that is one suggestion. Noble Lords will know that we have sought to ensure that we pursue all avenues. We are concerned about Zimbabwe, particularly the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the economic mismanagement, which is having an impact on the countries in the region. I shall certainly take back the noble Lord's idea.

<A NAME="20715-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, did the G8 summit discuss the problems of Angola? Coming out <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of the war into peace has proved much more difficult than one imagined, both the scale of the poverty and the scale of the hunger caused by the war. What is being done to make sure that food aid especially is made available and to bring about a quick improvement to the situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, there was discussion of Angola. The G8 action plan makes reference to three specific conflicts where the international community, and in particular the G8 countries, feel that there needs to be concerted international action; that is, the Sudan, the DRC and Angola. We remain committed to work with the UN and others not only to get food aid into Angola but also to those from UNITA who are disarming and demobilising. We shall continue to do that, but the situation remains difficult in terms of distribution channels.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that having tried to deal with problems in South Africa over a period of six years, I understand well the frustrating difficulties of trying to grapple with a situation of this kind from thousands of miles away? Does she further agree that if international pressure is to have the effect that we would all wish upon the catastrophic tragedy in Zimbabwe, it needs to be pervasive, comprehensive&#151;not least throughout Africa&#151;and sustained unflinchingly on every possible occasion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I totally agree with the noble Lord. In my comments to this House I have made that absolutely clear. It is particularly important that that pressure comes from governments within Africa and from the neighbouring countries that are being severely affected economically by the mismanagement of the Zimbabwe economy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us what immediate steps are being taken by the G8 countries, including the United Kingdom, to deal with the unfolding tragedy in Malawi? It is estimated, as the Minister will know, that something like one-third of children are close to starvation? Can she say what steps are being taken urgently to try to relieve this unfolding catastrophe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the food aid and famine situation not only in Zimbabwe but across the southern African region is deeply distressing and difficult. Malawi is one example. We have been working with the World Food Programme. At a meeting in South Africa it laid out for the international community the situation facing the whole region. We have been working with it and with non-governmental organisations to facilitate the delivery of food aid to Malawi. The pressing and immediate issue is humanitarian, but we will continue to work with the Government of Malawi on a longer term, bilateral basis to try to ensure that such situations are not repeated.

<P>

<a name="column_958"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Mr Mugabe at the African Union meeting presided over by President Gaddafi was not exactly reassuring? Can she tell the House precisely what we are to urge at the General Affairs Council on the 22nd of this month? Will we urge that pressure be brought to bear by all European countries on all their African partners to ensure that maize is planted now for next year? Will the question of HIV also be considered, as most of the HIV clinics, which are partly run by farmers' wives on farms, are closing? Finally, will anything be done to prevent the families of Ministers from travelling, not just the Ministers themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be aware that the travel ban is a European Union ban. I am sure that it will be considered again at the GAC meeting next Monday. It will be for the EU to decide whether to extend the ban as the noble Baroness suggests. We have been pressing our EU partners and working with them consistently over Zimbabwe, so that is not a new item on the agenda for consideration on Monday. The dialogue will continue.
<P>

<a name="20715-02_para0"></a>On HIV/AIDS, the noble Baroness will be aware that that is an area in which we have continued our bilateral assistance to Zimbabwe because of the terrible impact that it is having on ordinary Zimbabweans.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government will not have new statutory or other powers over the management of Network Rail, but the Strategic Rail Authority will have a non-executive director on the board of the company and will set a framework within which Network Rail must deliver a required output.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, given that Network Rail will be operated in accordance with the Strategic Rail Authority's strategic plan; that it will be regulated by the SRA; that its accounts will be incorporated in those of the SRA; and that the SRA, a government body, will be providing an equity cushion&#151;a de facto guarantee&#151;how can that company be determined to be a private company?
<P>

<a name="20715-02_para1"></a>Secondly, will the Minister now answer the Question that I asked his noble friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston on 27th June: how much will that synthetic structure cost the taxpayer in the additional costs of borrowing commercially, rather than on the gilt market?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount is right to say that the National Audit Office has ruled that Network Rail will be a subsidiary of the Strategic Rail Authority and that the SRA's accounts will include Network Rail's assets and liabilities. That accords with generally accepted accounting principles. It is also true that the Office for National Statistics, which is of course an independent body, has ruled that Network Rail is not a public sector company. It made that ruling in line with the European standard of accounts 1995. Different rules are produced for different purposes. We as a Government intend as far as possible to accord with generally accepted accounting practice and have been outstandingly successful in so doing.
<P>

<a name="20715-02_para2"></a>I am not familiar with the exact Question that the noble Viscount asked my noble friend Lord Macdonald, so I shall have to write to the noble Viscount about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, on the question of accounting practices, can my noble friend confirm that the Government are guaranteeing the overdraft of the new company? Under the new set of accounts that the Government will have to prepare under their latest Bill, will that not appear as a contingent liability of the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes, my Lords, my noble friend is entirely correct. That will appear as a contingent liability. The credit facilities will be provided by the SRA&#151;they constitute a large sum at present because there has been a substantial lack of investment. Under the 10-year plan, we propose an annual investment in the railways, on top of running costs, of £4.6 billion a year on average, which is three times the figure devoted to the railways during the 10 years before 1997.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, is not the Answer that the Minister should have given to my noble friend Lord Goschen that Network Rail has fallen between two stools? It is not a government organisation, so it does not have the advantage of being able to borrow cheaply on the gilt market, which could save it hundreds of millions of pounds a year; but it is not a private company, so it does not have the advantage of private sector involvement and accounting ability? It is a mess.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as for the advantage of private sector accounting ability, Network Rail will have roughly 100 members, of whom about 40 will be from the rail industry. The rest will represent the public interest and the Strategic Rail Authority.
<P>

<a name="20715-02_para3"></a>As for what Network Rail will have to pay for its finance, we shall see. Clearly, bridge finance will need to be provided&#151;the current amount is up to £10 billion.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, one way or another, very large sums are being provided for the new company by the Government. How will the Government explain to ordinary people, whose money in effect it is, how improvements will be obtained in three of the matters that cause the most concern: first, the lack of a proper engineering ethos within the former Railtrack; secondly, provision of safe and reliable services now; and, thirdly, the rapid increase in capacity of our rail services?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the formal answer to the question asked by the noble Baroness is the one that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave in his Statement on 27th June: the performance targets will be aligned to the Strategic Rail Authority's long-term plans, as well to Network Rail's obligations to its customers under its network licence. But the noble Baroness is right to say that the public will have to be convinced that that is the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, the Minister explained that the Government chose to follow European rules to keep Network Rail off the Government's balance sheet. Can he give one good, substantive reason for doing that? Can he explain how the Government differ from Enron, which also chose the accounting that suited it best?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government did not keep Network Rail off the balance sheet, it was the Office for National Statistics, which is independent of government, which decided to act under ESA 1995, with which the noble Baroness will be familiar. That is how we have to account to other European member states, so that serves a useful purpose. It is certainly entirely different from Enron, which concealed the fact that matters were off its accounts. We have been public in every way on the matter; we have declared everything to Parliament; we are in no way worried by such accusations.

Does the Minister agree with me that, if the Prime Minister intends to facilitate that by silencing the critics of genetic modification, he will do a disservice to informed and honest debate?

We wish to identify the public's questions and provide people with the information that will allow them to formulate their response. We want people to reach their own informed judgment. The independent Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission has provided detailed advice on how the debate might be conducted. We will respond to that advice as soon as possible.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that one of the most depressing features of the debate to which she referred is the assumption that an entire technology is either good or bad? Does she agree that it is the application of the technology that is important and needs proper scrutiny? The technology has been shown to be valuable in the genetically modified organisms that produce a range of things, from vegetarian cheddar cheese to life-saving vaccines. Will the Minister ensure that the Government protect research that allows us to have a proper evaluation of crops and, in particular, their potential impact on the developing world?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for raising that point. She is right. Many people who suffer from diabetes already benefit from insulin produced from the medical application of the GM process. Like the noble Baroness, we believe that the crops are not inherently good or bad. However, they must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the sort of concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that the Food Standards Agency, set up under Sir John Krebs, has stated that it can find no evidence of harm caused by the eating of GM food?

<A NAME="20715-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware that that statement had been made.

<a name="20715-03_para6"></a><P>

"( ) Any financial support made available as a result of subsection (1) above shall be paid in advance and such support for children over 16 shall be set at the same level as for children under 16."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-03_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: I would have said, "I rise", except for the fact that I have not yet had time to sit down. Anyway, I am deemed to have risen to move the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-03_para8"></a>There is no youth training programme for asylum seekers. There is no New Deal for asylum seekers. So the reasons commonly advanced for paying a different rate for those over 16 and those under 16 do not apply. An asylum seeker over 16 who is not yet allowed to work and has not yet been here for six months is in the same position of financial dependence as his juniors. There is therefore a good argument for taking both cases together.
<P>

<a name="20715-03_para9"></a>In the amendment, the use of the phrase "in advance" is also of considerable importance. The moment at which a claim for asylum is granted ought to be a moment of celebration for a refugee. All too often, it is one of the gravest spells of anxiety that they face. As they come off support under NASS they become eligible for benefits and that interval often can be extremely prolonged. Communication between NASS and the Benefits Agency has been very far from the best. Indeed, often the first that a refugee hears of his claim being accepted is a note from NASS saying, "Since your claim has been successful, your support has been terminated". The claimant takes the note to the Benefits Agency, which responds by saying, "We know nothing about this".
<P>

<a name="20715-03_para10"></a>Considerable problems appear to surround the issue of form NASS 35, the signing-off form to be handed over to the Benefits Agency. I have been in correspondence with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham. They have been extremely helpful, but it is too soon to know whether, as a result, things will get any better. In any case, it is clear that having one's claim as a refugee recognised ought not to be a reason for immediate destitution.
<P>

<a name="20715-03_para11"></a> If provision is made for payment in advance, one will cut off two weeks from any period of destitution, even if nothing else is done to improve the situation. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Taking two weeks off a period of destitution is by no means an insignificant advance. That alone would be a justification for the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 142 to which I have added my name and which I see as a probing amendment. Two weeks ago I met representatives of the Refugee Children's Consortium. They believe that all unaccompanied children should receive the level of care and protection to which they are entitled, which can only be right. The consortium points out that the policy of different funding, and thus levels of support, on the basis of age is out of line with statutory guidance on the assessment and support of children under the national assessment framework. The guidance requires local authorities to undertake a full needs-based rather than age-based assessment of all children in need and provide them with appropriate support. The principle of best interest enshrined in the Children Act 1989 must also be applied.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para0"></a>The consortium rightly says that it is for the Government to justify the fact that the grant available to local authorities for the support of unaccompanied minors should be determined by the age of the child. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, made a powerful point when he referred to the fact that the usual arguments against a uniform rate do not apply in exactly the same way in this case.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para1"></a>I am aware that changes have been made to the systems of payment so that, although retrospectively, the grant is now paid quarterly in arrears. That improvement was welcomed by my honourable friend Mr Malins on 14th May, at col. 212 of the Official Report. However, we have to ask why the Government are not prepared to go the further yard or two in order  to achieve something closer to a real-time reimbursement of support payments to local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I recognise the generosity of spirit with which this amendment was moved. However, we do not think that it is necessary; indeed, in some ways it could be unhelpful.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para2"></a>The aim of the clause is to increase the flexibility with which the Home Office can reimburse local authorities. In our view, the amendment would restrict that. It asks for payments in advance to what is generally accepted on all sides to be a volatile, demand-led population that is extremely difficult to forecast. It means that local authorities would have to produce estimates of the number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children that they would be supporting in the future, as well as the costs that they were likely to incur. That could result in large balances being held in local authority accounts which could be used elsewhere. We do not regard that as a proper use of government funds.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para3"></a>As acknowledged, the Home Office has already moved to quarterly payments in arrears to local authorities for supporting adults and families. It fully intends to continue doing so for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. That will do much to remedy <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>some of the properly identified problems suffered by local authorities without the need for a complex advance payment system that would have to take account of the volatility that I mentioned.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para4"></a>The second part of the amendment seeks to fix grant levels for all unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to the same amount without taking into account the level of support required. Costs to local authorities are much more dependent on the actual support they provide for children as assessed on a one-to-one basis rather than crudely on age. Last year the grant regime sought to recognise this for the first time by continuing the higher rate of support for older children whose initial assessment had shown that they required support under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. The higher rate for children supported under that section, as opposed to a rate set on an age basis, reflects the care costs to meet the needs of children as assessed under very strict guidance issued jointly by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para5"></a>We believe that it would be wrong and possibly damaging to children to pre-empt the assessment by prescribing levels of care based on age. That would not ensure that they received appropriate care while, of course, encouraging value for money. We do not think that we could justify paying the higher rate to all regardless of need and without regard to assuring value for money.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para6"></a>I can advise the House that there is a thorough review of the grant mechanism in plan and that the overwhelming requests received from local authorities are for more flexibility rather than prescription. That may well be where we differ.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, asked about delays in assessing social security benefits. I pay tribute to him for having raised this issue with my noble friend Lord Rooker. As the noble Lord pointed out, his point has had a very sympathetic hearing. We recognise and acknowledge that there have been problems. In fairness, however, officials at the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions have been working to reduce the scale of any difficulties. We are trying to ensure that when an individual leaves his accommodation because he has been granted leave to remain he is provided for as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para8"></a>The noble Earl referred to the NASS 35 document. This is issued to enable Jobcentre Plus, formerly the Benefits Agency, to calculate any backdated payments of benefits and thus is not strictly required to obtain benefits. Therefore asylum seekers should go without delay to their Jobcentre Plus with the document which granted them leave to enter or to remain, along with any other identification that they may have in order to start the process.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para9"></a>We are working very hard to ensure that any pain resulting from the transitional phase to which the noble Earl referred is minimised and that all necessary support is put in place in the way both the noble Earl and the Government would wish to see.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Lord is correct to point out that the production of form NASS 35 is not required to receive benefits. Could he manage to make that clear to the Benefits Agency?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister responds to the question put by my noble friend, can he also tell the Committee whether he has estimated the amount of money that will be involved under Clauses 110 and 111, bearing in mind that we are referring to the same level of support as that offered to those aged 16? The Minister should bear in mind the number of young asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their applications. There should be no difficulty in working out the costs involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall seek to clarify for his benefit the point put to me by the noble Earl and ensure that he is made aware of the position.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para10"></a>I do not have to hand the figures sought by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. Again, however, I am willing to seek to find out what would be the implications because, clearly, costs are important. We need to ensure that the system is cost-effective.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para11"></a>I return to the first and most important point that I made; namely, ensuring that we have in place the requisite flexibility. That is most important in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The Home Office is always in favour of its own flexibility and everyone else's inflexibility. One person's flexibility necessarily involves inflexibility for another. Where one has a need arising and a procedure for meeting it, which may come sometime after it, clearly there has to be give somewhere in the system. The interim gap must be filled either by the asylum seeker, by the local authority or by the Home Office. If there is any fourth possibility it has not occurred to me. If it occurs to the Minister, I shall be very glad to hear it.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para12"></a>The question is which of the three is best able to show the flexibility needed for carrying a debt&#151;which is what it is&#151;during the period before it is reimbursed. The asylum seeker is in the worst position. I was reading late last night a brief from the BMA about health problems among asylum seekers. Admittedly it dates from the unlamented voucher days but some of it is still applicable, although I would hesitate to say how much. It indicates extremely poor standards of nutrition. It also indicates extreme hardship in regard to transport. In one case, for example, a man had to go and see a psychiatrist to get evidence in support of his claim, but, because he had no money whatever left for fares, he had to walk 35 miles through the night in order to be there in time for the interview. This does not suggest that asylum seekers are best able to show flexibility while waiting for their money to come in.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para13"></a>The Government may be under the illusion that local authorities are rather better off. Most local authorities would not share that opinion. A shortage of money among local authorities is a problem that has <P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>got worse every year I have been in the House. The argument about the budget of care homes illustrates that very clearly, although this is not the time to go into that. So if someone is to bear the strain, it would be much better if it was the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para14"></a>As to the question of not relating it to age, people of 18 eat as much as people of 17; they wear out their shoes as fast as people of 17; they need overcoats for the winter in Lancashire just as much as people of 17. If there is to be a discrimination, I do not see the rationale. If the Minister could enlighten me, I would be very interested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Earl paints a dismal picture. I do not see it the same way. The Government appreciate that there are difficulties, but we have to make difficult choices. In working a system that provides aid and support, we have tried to increase flexibility. I believe that we have done that to a great degree. We have listened very carefully to what the noble Earl has said. As I said earlier, we are grateful to him for bringing to our attention the cases that he has. If we were to listen to every single case in the same way, we would end up with an infinitely expanding system. I do not believe that that would necessarily be right.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para15"></a>Hard choices have to be made in public expenditure. That is exactly what we have tried to do, but with fairness and balance. We have tried to ensure that local authorities are properly reimbursed and we have tried to speed up the process. In moving away from the voucher scheme&#151;which the noble Earl says is unlamented, and I can understand why he said that&#151;we have tried to focus on a flexible system.
<P>

<a name="20715-04_para16"></a>I cannot accept the amendment. I understand the spirit in which it is moved and I accept that there are hard cases. But hard cases do not necessarily make good law, and we have to understand that important point in making hard choices. I invite the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment. The noble Earl brings to this issue his experience of cases in which he is involved and, if any particular difficulties arise, it would be helpful if he would continue to do exactly that. We can then ensure that such cases are looked at closely and consider what further improvements can be made. In the mean time, I invite the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-05_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. It is true that I painted a dismal picture. The bulk of the evidence for that comes from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the BMA, which are two reputable organisations. That dismal picture is shared by almost everyone who has made a study of this subject. It is shared by the Christian Churches, by the National Association of Social Workers and by the National Association of Probation Officers. There are many cases in the BMA files of social services turning away asylum seekers because they were simply unable to handle their problems. I cannot think of anyone, other than the Government, who does not share this dismal picture.

<P>

<a name="20715-05_para0"></a>As the BMA has stressed very strongly, one of the consequences has been the creation of a considerable amount of mental illness among asylum seekers, most of whom are already somewhat traumatised when they arrive here. As the Minister knows, mental illness is an extremely expensive condition for the Government. It may be that the Government, like Charles I, may be in the position of not being rich enough to afford economies. It seems that we are in the usual position where the Government's view is, "They are all out of step but our Johnny". I do not believe that I can shift them from that view. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-05_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE GRANTED LEAVE TO REMAIN
<br>
 The following shall be inserted after section 94(6) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (interpretation of Part VI)&#151;
<br>
"(6A) If, on the determination of his claim for asylum, the asylum seeker is granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, he is to be treated (for the purposes of the provision of support and accommodation under this Part only) as continuing to be an asylum seeker&#151;
<br>
(a) for a period of 60 days; or
<br>
(b) until he secures adequate accommodation and support,
<br>
whichever is the sooner.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-05_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 142ZA, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 146A and 238A. These amendments seek to insert two new clauses into the Bill and to make a consequential amendment to the money clause. The first proposed new clause seeks to address the question of successful asylum seekers who obtain refugee status and are allowed to remain in this country but who receive a 28-day eviction notice to leave the accommodation provided for them by the National Asylum Support Service. The new clause seeks to extend the 28 days to 60 days. I shall explain my reasoning for that shortly.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para6"></a>The second proposed new clause requires local authorities to give guidance and advice, in their own language, to new refugees in accommodation who are looking for an alternative home. The third amendment is a consequential amendment to the money clause. It seeks to ensure that local authorities are reimbursed for the work involved in providing that advice and guidance to new refugees.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para7"></a>The purpose of the two proposed new clauses is to help integrate those people who are going to stay here; to help them settle and remain in the places to which they have been dispersed. This mostly means them remaining in northern conurbations, where there is a relatively good supply of affordable accommodation. It is not intended to help new refugees to return to London and the South East, and other areas which are under great pressure, where they would only add to the problems of <P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>homelessness. Local authorities have an obligation to provide accommodation to homeless families in these areas despite all the pressures on them. Local authorities also have a duty to help single refugees, but probably not to provide them with a home. In the overcrowded London market that will inevitably lead to more overcrowding and homelessness.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para8"></a>Previously, the time allowed for people to make their own alternative arrangements and leave their NASS provided accommodation was 14 days. This was increased to 28 days in April but there were only weak obligations on local authorities to provide any support and assistance to those people in their search for a new home, or with the other requirements upon them if they are to integrate into the local community.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para9"></a>Since the Second Reading debate in your Lordships' House I have visited the North East to talk to people engaged in helping refugees. I have spoken to the north of England refugee service, the refugee advisory committee on Tyneside, the regional refugee forum and the North East consortium for asylum seekers' services. I have talked to people in local authorities in Newcastle, north Tyneside, Redcar and Cleveland. I have talked to representatives providing accommodation in the private sector and I have talked to refugee community organisations which look after the needs of Kurdish, Congolese, Somali, Angolan, Iraqi and other groups. I have also had a presentation from the University of Sunderland, which has undertaken a survey of the aspirations of asylum seekers in terms of their future housing needs.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para10"></a>The conclusion that I have drawn from all that is the good news that dispersal is showing some signs of working. Those who have been sent to northern cities are prepared to make a go of it and stay there; 40 per cent said that it would be their preferred choice to stay in the area to which they have been sent; and nearly 40 per cent more say that they would be willing to stay and give it a try. Therefore, 80 per cent of asylum seekers would stay in the area to which they have been dispersed, rather than head back immediately for the overcrowded South.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para11"></a>The bad news is that all those to whom I spoke agreed that it is bound to take more than 28 days for people to get themselves sorted out once the news comes through that they have been given leave to remain in this country. They have to get a national insurance number, which alone can take two to three months. Without that number they cannot legally obtain a job or benefits, nor can they open a bank account. They need to visit the Jobcentre if they want jobseeker's allowance and will have to fill in all the necessary forms. They have to go to the local authority if they require housing benefit which is notorious for its administrative problems.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para12"></a>Having sorted everything out under all those headings, they need to go into the marketplace to look for a private landlord, or possibly persuade a local authority, to find them accommodation. I have a daughter at university in Newcastle, so I have been through the process of finding privately rented accommodation there, and I can tell the Committee <P>


<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that that takes more than 28 days. All the students going back for the next academic year who have any sense have already secured their accommodation. They cannot do it within 28 days, and students do not have to seek housing benefit; they have parents to act as guarantors for private landlords. It is setting people an insuperable task to expect them within that short period to find accommodation and put down roots to remain and settle in the area.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para13"></a>My first proposed new clause would extend that period to 60 days, and the second would put an obligation on local authorities to provide advice and guidance in the language of the refugee household, to assist in the process of becoming assimilated and integrated into the local community.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para14"></a>The Minister has kindly written to me following the Second Reading debate and has made the point that rather than extending the 28-day period, it would be good if the process of issuing the national insurance number were speeded up. I entirely agree that that would be desirable, but even with people receiving their national insurance number faster, and cutting two to three months to something far less, I cannot see that all the processes could be reasonably accomplished before the eviction time arrives and people have to leave. The Minister suggests that the best agencies for advice may be local voluntary and community bodies. I agree, but it seems wise to place the obligation on local authorities and for the Secretary of State to reimburse them for providing that advice and guidance, even though they would discharge their duty often through local agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para15"></a>Far more people are affected by the dispersal policy than are ever likely to be affected by the new accommodation centres. The policy is a critical part of the Government's efforts to handle questions of asylum seekers and refugees. Dispersal policy is showing signs of successfully persuading people that the new places to which they have been sent&#151;away from the pressured South&#151;are suitable for their long-term needs. That good work will be undermined if we are impatient and demand that people leave the accommodation too quickly and we do not give them the support and guidance that I hope those proposed new clauses will provide. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   We support the amendments. In doing so, I was delighted to hear the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Best, whose experience of charitable work, especially in housing, is exceptional. His speech should therefore carry considerable weight.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para16"></a> The noble Lord made a good case for his sensible amendments. I would make three points. First, we are talking about asylum seekers who are no longer waiting in the queue but who have been granted leave to remain. Therefore we are not talking about someone whose rights about staying in this country have not been determined. Secondly, I want to explain why our support is so vital. When we consider the history of anyone who has come to this country, the sooner they can be integrated and absorbed into the community, the better not only for the asylum seekers but for the community.

<P>

<a name="20715-05_para17"></a>I shall make an analogy. It may be rather difficult for the Committee to equate it with asylum seekers, but let us consider the resettlement of offenders who come out of prison and the social exclusion report that was published last week. The Government have conceded that they must help people who desperately need it. If such help is not given serious problems are created. We need to ensure that the people who will settle in this country are given adequate help.
<P>

<a name="20715-05_para18"></a>Thirdly, there is the matter of housing and applying for benefit in languages other than English. It is most important that local authorities would be encouraged to assist in this exercise if they knew that funds were ultimately available from the Secretary of State. In other words, the Government should back up this kind of initiative by local authorities to help people who will be part and parcel of the community. We are delighted to support the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-06_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I, too, welcome the amendment warmly and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Best, not only on the clarity of his remarks but on his exemplary patience in waiting through hours and hours of our proceedings in the previous sitting of the Committee, only to be denied the chance to move it in the end. He has proved himself a good House of Lords man; I only hope that he does not have to do that too often, but I admire immensely the way in which he has done it.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para0"></a>The amendments meet exactly the difficulties that I outlined a moment ago. The moment of acceptance as a refugee should be one of rejoicing, but it is a moment of coming down with a bump. It reminds me of the sad story of the step-father of one of my undergraduate friends who was parachuted into Arnhem and broke his leg on landing. He succeeded in concealing himself in the bushes while the Germans hunted noisily around him. He got out of the area and into France, leapt out of his hotel bedroom just as the Gestapo came in through the door, got into a pipeline and made his way to the Swiss frontier. Just as the frontier guards were approaching him, he found that the French Resistance had planted spying documents on him which would have led to his being shot. He finally made his way to Switzerland, and then to Lisbon. After a six months' wait he got a flight back to England, bringing with him one bottle of sherry&#151;which the Customs impounded. His words were: "And then I knew I was home"! I suppose that that is tolerable for British subjects with an honourable military record, but for people for whom this is the first experience of accepting life as a British citizen, it really is a bit of a shock.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para1"></a>The proposed 60-day period is exactly what is needed. It reminds me of the extended period of eligibility for housing benefit introduced by Mr Kenneth Clarke in the Budget in 1993. One person to whom I was talking, who was at the time on benefit, said that this one concession was worth all the rest put together.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para2"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Best, that if the Government accept these amendments, as I very much hope they will, it is worth keeping an eye on how they <P>


<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are administered. In regard to the Kenneth Clarke concession it was by no means always made clear to applicants that if they did not apply for it within the first eight days, they would not get it at all. There is always a wheeze somewhere in the background&#151;for which I believe Ministers are not to blame. Eternal vigilance will be needed here as elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para3"></a>I agree with everything that the noble Lord said about national insurance numbers, but the delay in allocating national insurance numbers has been a standing problem for as long as I have been a spokesman on social security&#151;which is a great deal longer than I care to count. Eight years ago, I became the longest serving social security spokesman in any party in either House.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para4"></a>I remember when my party began to complain about the delay in allocating national insurance numbers. The Government said that this was grossly exaggerated. They said that we were painting a dismal picture. What they did not know was that our spokesman's researcher had had her national insurance card stolen with her handbag and, six months later, had not succeeded in obtaining a replacement. So we knew perfectly well that it was a real problem. The problem is with the Government's ability to handle software, and that extends a great deal beyond our responsibilities. The noble Lord, Lord Best, was right to say that, although we must try to do better in regard to national insurance numbers, that is not an adequate answer to the problems that he raises.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para5"></a>The amendment probably will provide an adequate answer. I certainly cannot think of a better one. I welcome it warmly and I hope that the Government accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   At Second Reading, I advised the Government to listen carefully to what my noble friend Lord Best was saying. Perhaps I may congratulate him on his research in the field and on producing three quite detailed but practical amendments. I just wonder whether 60 days will be long enough in every case, but this is obviously a step in the right direction. I underline strongly the reference in Amendment No. 146A to giving advice in the language appropriate to the new refugee's understanding. Having been deeply involved over many years in housing aid and advice, I am sure that that amendment is absolutely on the right lines.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para6"></a> I hope that the Conservative Front Bench will support the amendment and I trust that the Government will accept it.

<A NAME="20715-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Best, for having introduced this subject into our deliberations. I ask my noble friend the Minister, when he replies, to take the issue behind the amendments extremely seriously.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred to the need to celebrate the gaining of the status of acceptance. But there is another, equally important issue. That is: how <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in those initial days and weeks the foundations can be laid for a successful life in the future. If we are serious about wanting asylum seekers to make a success of their lives in our community and to be able to become fully integrated, we have to have specific and positive policies in place to help them in that transition. To have them totally mesmerised and preoccupied with the anxieties and issues of trying to find even a roof over their heads will not help.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para8"></a>It would be wrong to make an absolute comparison, but there is an approximate comparison with the successfully rehabilitated prisoner leaving prison and coming back to start life as a positive citizen. There is a major issue in our society in that context. So often, it goes wrong because generous, practical support is not there at the critical time. Whether or not these particular amendments are the right ones, the issue is a very important one. I do not merely hope but am sure that, in replying, my noble friend will want to be able to indicate that the Government take these matters seriously and are determined to have practical measures in place to meet the need.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The objectives behind the amendments are wholly laudable. I simply have some difficulty with the detail of the practical application that the proposed new clauses might entail. Therefore, I have one or two questions for the noble Lord, Lord Best. He may be able to address them in his final remarks on the amendment, or he may prefer to write to me on these matters.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para9"></a>Amendment No. 142ZA requires that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for a period of 60 days; or . . . until [a person] secures adequate accommodation and support, whichever is the sooner",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-06_para10"></a>the support should continue. I wonder what the definition of "adequate accommodation" is in these circumstances, and who decides what is "adequate"; and, indeed, whether the term covers the quality, size or location of the accommodation. This could be a sensitive issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para11"></a>It may be asked who could possibly object to Amendment No. 146A; namely, to the idea that someone should receive housing information and advice free of charge and in the language suited to that person's needs. One would hope that that is best practice and that all local authorities now follow it. If they do not, they jolly well ought to get on and do it.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para12"></a>I come from a town where the local authority has made its best efforts to provide such information over many years. I know that the advice has not always been perfect, but the authority tries to cover such languages as are commonly used in the area. Twelve per cent of the population in our constituency do not have English as their first language.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para13"></a>I have a couple of questions on Amendment No. 238A. It points out that any increase in spending as a result of these duties ought to be payable by the Secretary of State. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Best, has been given by those briefing him an estimate of the annual cost of this proposal in terms of the increase over the next five years, so that one can understand just what kind of costs one is looking at. <P>


<a name="column_974"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The question that I have to ask from the LGA's point of view is: would these sums be ring-fenced? The local authorities are keen not to have sums ring-fenced because of their intention to be as much in control of local funding as possible.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para14"></a>As those are detailed questions, I shall be happy if the noble Lord would prefer to write to me rather than attempt to answer them now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I join in the tributes on all sides of the Committee to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for bringing forward these amendments and for the way in which he has addressed the issues. His insights and experience will greatly refresh our debates in such matters and expand our range of experience in dealing with some difficult issues.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para15"></a>Having said that, and underlining that we fully understand the concerns raised by the noble Lord, I have to conclude that we believe them to be unnecessary. As has been acknowledged, we have extended the period from 14 to 28 days so the period of grace is longer. That was in the light of experience which suggested that it was an important point to match.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para16"></a>We are also working closely with all interested parties through the national refugee integration forum to promote the better resettlement and integration into the community of successful asylum seekers. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, properly raised the need to take the issues seriously. The Government do so. For that reason we have this legislation in place. For that reason, we have put in place a battery of measures to ensure that those who seek, quite properly, to stay here as asylum seekers are cared for and are integrated fully into our communities.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para17"></a>The Home Office is working closely with the Department for Work and Pensions to improve the arrangements for enabling asylum seekers to transfer from central government support to mainstream benefits or to enter the labour market. We acknowledge&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Best, made the point well&#151;that there have been some difficulties with national insurance numbers. We recognise that there have been delays but we are working hard with the DWP to improve performance and ensure that people are properly accorded a national insurance number and can enter the labour market when they wish with all the support and guidance that they require.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para18"></a>Amendment No. 146A seeks to help asylum seekers with leave to remain into accommodation and ensure that they have proper allocation of accommodation. We want to ensure that that is so. In the Homelessness Act 2002 an amendment to Section 166 of the Housing Act 1996 requires the local housing authority to secure that advice and information are available free of charge to persons in its area about the right to make an application for allocation of housing accommodation; and that any necessary assistance in making that application is available free of charge to persons in the area who are likely to have difficulty in doing so without assistance. That measure was aimed at ensuring that people in the circumstances described by <P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord are given all the help they require. It seems to me to meet the principal aims of the noble Lord's amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, rightly pointed to good practice in local government. I am certain that most local authorities will do all they can to ensure that advice, assistance and support are given in the most appropriate form. My former local authority did that because we believed it to be extremely important. We recognised the vulnerability of people inexperienced in the ways of the local authority and local authority bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para20"></a>Best practice is to be celebrated and encouraged. As a Government, we shall play our part in doing that. Great progress has been made. Local authorities are to be congratulated, as is the Local Government Association on the important work it has done in that field.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para21"></a>The noble Lord wishes to ensure that Amendment No. 146A is accepted. Local authorities should receive extra funding from central government for advice in respect of housing where it involves people who have been granted leave to remain following an application for asylum. We are not clear how in practice one can identify that expenditure, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay; and how one would separate that expenditure from other expenditure on housing advice in order accurately to attribute costs. We also wonder whether it would be appropriate for such a distinction to be made in the first place. The point has been well made that local authorities are nervous about and do not take easily to the exercise of ring fencing. I know that local authorities have lobbied firmly against it in the past. That is not to say that extra help should never be given to local authorities if they are faced with new and unusual pressures.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para22"></a>The Government have responded in the past. We have ensured that those supporting asylum seekers under the interim scheme have been given support. We wish to ensure that that support is there in the future. However, in general the Government would not want to disturb the usual arrangements for providing central government support to local authorities under the revenue support grant.
<P>

<a name="20715-06_para23"></a>That said, if a case were made for extra funding, we already have a provision in Section 110 which will allow for the Secretary of State to fund local authorities for expenditure, in connection with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"persons who are, or have been, asylum-seekers; and . . . their dependants".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-06_para24"></a>If we thought that it was appropriate, payments could be made using that power. It is there for that express purpose. In all those circumstances, I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment but will withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-07_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, can he name for me one person knowledgeable in the subject and not on the government payroll who shares his opinion that these amendments are unnecessary?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   With the greatest of respect to the noble Earl, it is a somewhat fatuous <P>


<a name="column_976"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 976</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point. The Government have been putting in place a framework of measures and powers which make the system work to the best interests of those affected. In answering the noble Lord, Lord Best, I pointed out that we have powers and measures in place which enable local authorities to carry out the functions asked of them. I believe that we are providing adequate powers and measures to deal with the problem which the noble Lord, Lord Best, makes quite properly in this Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Best: </B>   I am most grateful to the Committee for the support I felt from many quarters for these amendments and in particular to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for his comments. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked two questions. The first was on the definition of "adequate" regarding accommodation. Guidance from the Government would need to accompany the Bill when enacted. The definition of adequate accommodation may not be a very great hurdle to cross. Properties would need to comply with the fitness standard, not be overcrowded, and meet the environmental health requirements. But one is not suggesting that this is a passport to particularly special housing in any sense. I do not believe that that is likely to be too big an obstacle.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para0"></a>Secondly, if local authorities are required to provide such advice, would the costs reimbursed to local authorities for providing such advice be ring fenced? The Minister said that it may be possible for funds to be paid under Section 110. That may well be a better route. If we foist upon local authorities more duties and responsibilities but without provision for those to be paid for by central government, it may be a deterrent for them to do what is required of them.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para1"></a>The cost of providing advice can be quite high if specialist interpreters have to be drawn in. I suspect that those costs would fall disproportionately on specific authorities where there are clusters and concentrations of refugees. Through amendment already made to the Homelessness Act the local authority has an obligation to provide such advice. For those extra costs to fall entirely on local authorities without recognition that they could be reimbursed might be unfair.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para2"></a>I have a final point to commend the amendment. The process of speeding up decision-making on the granting of refugee status to asylum seekers is entirely admirable but it is likely, in the view of those people with whom I talked in the North East, to mean that the problems with the 28-day rule will become more severe. People will have less time in which to learn English and become familiar with the area to which they have moved before they get their notice, and are allowed to stay if they are successful or have to leave. The view from the North East, at any rate&#151;I am sure that it is typical of other regions to which people have been dispersed&#151;is that the 28-day rule will increasingly cause a crisis for those endeavouring to help refugees and for the refugees themselves, who are likely to turn tail and return to the communities in <P>

<A NAME="20715-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement being made in another place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20715-07_para7"></a>"The long-term funding we announce today for Britain's public services is possible because the bills of economic failure in unemployment and debt have been radically reduced; the state of our public finances is strong; and, despite uncertainties in the global economy, inflation is under control, interest rates have been low and stable, and employment and growth continue to rise.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para8"></a>"In this period in global financial markets of greater instability, our task and our determination&#151;as always&#151;is to remain vigilant and committed to sustaining monetary and fiscal stability, with the strength to take the right long-term decisions. And I can tell the House that over the economic cycle we will not only meet all our fiscal disciplines and rules but we are on track to meet our fiscal disciplines and rules with a margin for prudence even on the most cautious case and even on the most cautious assumptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para9"></a>"Indeed, it is so that we can steer a course of stability across the economic cycle that we have reduced net debt from 44 per cent of British national income in 1997 to 30.4 per cent last year&#151;in contrast to 41 per cent in the US, 53 per cent in the euro area as a whole and 59 per cent in Japan.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para10"></a>"So, as we set out in the Budget, Britain's debt has been reduced to the lowest level of national income in the G7 and the lowest of all our major European competitors.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para11"></a>"Having last year paid off more debt in one year than all of the previous governments in the past 50 years, I can report that this year debt interest payments will be lower as a share of national income than they have been at any time in nearly a century.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para12"></a> "Twenty years ago, debt interest payments consumed 4 per cent of national income. Debt interest is now half that: just 2 per cent&#151;a saving worth £20 billion a year. Those extra resources have <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>made it possible to recruit more nurses, more doctors, more teachers and more police than at any time in the past two decades.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para13"></a>"Twenty years ago&#151;indeed, 10 years ago also&#151;1.6 per cent of national income was spent on the costs of unemployment. I can report today that this year we will spend just 0.4 per cent, savings worth a further £10 billion a year.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para14"></a>"It is through maintaining a steady hand on the public finances at all times that we are able to meet our fiscal rules and match our reforms with new resources so that efficient, strong public services play their part in delivering a modern Britain of greater opportunity and security not just for some but for all.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para15"></a>"I can report to the House that, holding strictly to the total spending envelope I set out in the Budget, we are raising departmental spending from £240 billion this year to £263 billion next year, to £280 billion in 2004-05, and to £301 billion in 2005-06. In total, by 2006, there will be £61 billion a year more for improved public services.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para16"></a>"While 10 years ago only 50p of every pound of additional expenditure went to the public services, the rest having to be spent on debt and social security, in this review almost 80p in every additional pound is going directly to improving public services&#151;and of the remaining 20p most is being spent not on debt interest or unemployment but on improved pensioner and children's benefits.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para17"></a>"In each area of service delivery, from housing to education and from policing to defence, we are tying new resources to new reform and results, developing a modern way for running efficient public services: setting demanding national targets; performance monitored by independent and open audit and inspection; front-line staff given the power and flexibility to deliver; extending choice; rewarding success; and turning round failing services.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para18"></a>"I can also tell the House that, over the next three years as we reverse the backlog in investment, our projections&#151;other than the commitments to health paid for by national insurance&#151;from 2006 are based on real terms increases in spending on public services at 2.5 per cent a year.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para19"></a>"With this review's decisions we not only will continue to address past decades of chronic under-investment in education, health, transport and housing but we will rise to new challenges in a changed global environment&#151;challenges internationally including the essential duty of fighting terrorism, and challenges here at home as global economic competition brings vastly increased opportunities but also increased insecurities: the role for government&#151;by expanding educational, employment and economic opportunity and by encouraging stronger communities&#151;to enable and empower people to make globalisation work for their families and their future.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para20"></a>"First, to respond to global insecurities and the new fight against terrorism, the Secretary of State for Defence is announcing that the budget for our Armed <P>

That is the largest sustained real terms increase in defence spending in 20 years.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para21"></a>"Since the tragic events of September 11th, international co-operation&#151;and, led by the Prime Minister, Britain's international engagement&#151;has assumed a new importance. So the Foreign Secretary's budget will rise from £1.3 billion this year to £1.5 billion by 2005&#150;06. Within this we will strengthen the work of the British Council, whose budget will rise from £157 million a year to £185 million&#151;and the budget for the BBC World Service, whose 160 million a week audience is now its largest ever, will be £38 million a year higher by 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para22"></a>"In meeting the urgent moral challenge of combating international poverty, the question is how a strengthened commitment by our country can inspire a step change in aid from all the richest countries in order to fulfil the millennium development goals: to halve poverty, cut child mortality by two-thirds and deliver primary education for all.

<a name="20715-07_para23"></a>"So the Secretary of State for International Development is announcing a rise in UK aid from the £2 billion it was in 1997, and the £3.3 billion last year, to £4.9 billion by 2006&#151;the biggest ever rise. That is a 35 per cent real terms increase since 2001 and a 93 per cent real terms increase since 1997, from the 0.26 per cent of national income we inherited and 0.32 per cent today to 0.4 per cent by 2006. And by untying aid and targeting aid on the poorest countries, we ensure that more money goes to tackle poverty than at any time in the history of British aid.

<a name="20715-07_para24"></a>"Starting with our dialogue with Churches and non-governmental organisations next week, onwards to September's Johannesburg summit and IMF-World Bank meetings, we want this new finance from our country to be an encouragement and a signal for a new 50 billion dollar international financing facility involving all rich countries: a new alliance against poverty which recognises that by meeting our moral obligations to the poorest of the world we advance opportunity and security for all of the world.

<a name="20715-07_para42"></a>"So, first, the Government are today publishing new public service agreements setting out agreed outcome targets and reforms for each department. Second, with independent audit and statutory inspection, departments and agencies will be fully accountable for performance against targets. So in addition to the new Police Standards Unit we are creating the new health and social care inspectorates, a reformed criminal justice system inspection regime and a single Housing Inspectorate. Third, in each service area the review's decisions promote choice and devolve responsibility, authority and flexibility from the centre out to local and regional decision-making&#151;to primary care trusts, head teachers and governors in schools, police commanders, and local service providers.

<a name="20715-07_para43"></a>"One essential feature of this year's spending decisions is that voluntary, charitable and community organisations will also receive significantly increased funding to support their chosen role in delivering local services.

That is a measure for which I hope there will soon be all-party support.

But we will only achieve our goals for further and higher education if we persuade more young people to stay on at school. Thirty years ago, the school leaving age was raised to 16. But Britain cannot reach its full potential as long as nearly a quarter of 16 to 18 year-olds are not in education or training. For decades Britain has suffered the worst drop-out rate from school of any industrialised country.

Compared with growth of lower than 2 per cent a year in the 18 years to 1997, there will be a real terms rise for education in England, even after inflation, of 6 per cent a year for each of the next three years&#151;the biggest sustained rise in a generation.

I also say straight away that there are several aspects of the Minister's Statement that we want to study in more detail and others to which we are happy to give a welcome immediately&#151;in particular, the extra spending on the war on terrorism and defence and also the increased budget for international development.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para77"></a>Of course, as the Minister said, it is also a fine and worthy aim to help students to stay longer in school. Perhaps he will comment later on how that might be paid for and, in particular, whether child benefit will continue as a universal allowance.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para78"></a>Having said that, I wonder whether, after that stirring performance, the Minister would be disappointed to learn that in the latest research in word association tests, in which people are invited to select the word from a list which they most identify with the Government, the word that they now pick is "disappointment". That may be because this is the third time that the Government have announced the results of a major spending review; it is the third time that people have heard how much more money is to be <P>

<P>

<a name="20715-07_para79"></a>But, after six Budgets, five years in office and three spending reviews, the outline of an unattractive conclusion is beginning to form in people's minds; namely, the Government may not know how to bring about the improvements in public services that they want to see. Therefore, as I believe the Government say, this Statement is a defining moment for them.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para80"></a>It was in this year's Budget that the Government, ever watchful of the public mood, sensing the danger and running out of the clever taxing and accounting devices on which they had relied successfully for many years, hit on a startling new plan. In this Budget, a new concept emerged in the Government's mission statement&#151;a most blasphemous of possibilities that one hardly dares whisper its name. It was "sincerity".
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para81"></a>Before this Budget, any impertinent functionary in the Treasury who embarked on the route of openly justifying tax rises, perhaps with a page of prose of engaging frankness, would find that a bolt of lightning struck the pen from his hand. But now, perhaps unable to find more invisible tax rises and nervous that the public might see through them in any case, the Government declared that in order to pay for all the spending about which we have just heard there would be more tax in the form of national insurance contributions which would be spent, in particular, on health. What mean-spirited curmudgeon, they reckoned, could disagree with that?

<a name="20715-07_para82"></a>But the eye of the public, which is always restless in its quest for a true picture of the activities of our Government, sees instead that the money being raised is either not spent on health or, if it is spent, is ineffective. I refer your Lordships to a particularly helpful page in the Government's Budget Red Book which shows the impact of the national insurance contribution increases as raising personal tax by £4.6 billion. But one searches in vain for the equivalent amount being spent on health. Instead, in the same table one finds that the exact same amount&#151;that is, £4.6 billion&#151;is shown to have been spent not on health but on the Government's tax credits. Therefore, all the money ostensibly being raised for health is not being spent on hospitals but on benefits.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para83"></a>The Minister will say shortly that other money is being spent on health. "No", he says, "it's not hypothecated money to health", but "yes", he says, "it will be spent". Therefore, the question remains: why does it seem to have no effect and why are the public disappointed? The answer lies in what I believe to be the most accurate gauge of public sector inflation. For some reason, it is known as the "GDP deflator for government consumption". In the five years to 1998 it rose by 2.2 per cent a year. By the end of 1999 it was running at 4 per cent, rising to 5.75 per cent in 2000. In the last financial year to the end of March the figure was 6.5 per cent. That is three times the economy's overall inflation rate of 1.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para84"></a>Coming up to date, in the first quarter of this year public spending rose at an annual rate of 11 per cent. How can such a large increase have so little effect? It is <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because 59 per cent of that sum was eaten up by higher wages and prices in the public sector. So the effective rate of increase in spending was only 4.2 per cent year on year.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para85"></a>The Government now find themselves on a ratchet. They spend; they fail; so they spend even more. The public can see that too and that is why the clear message from pre-Budget and post-Budget polls is of scepticism about the direct link between spending and outcome. People have worked out that it is possible to spend more, much more, without success. For example Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have spending levels per head which are much higher than those in England and, indeed, above the European average for health. But waiting lists in Wales and Northern Ireland are much longer than those in England and waiting times in Scotland are actually going up.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para86"></a>So the growing fear with this Government, perhaps reflected in the research I described, is that while they wear their heart on their sleeve about care, they do not seem to know how to make their good intentions come true. Take, for example, what the Chancellor calls,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The first challenge is to increase our productivity".&#151;[Official Report, 25/11/97; col. 773.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-07_para87"></a>That was five years ago, and what happened? The latest figures actually show a fall in productivity in the first quarter of the year. The Government see that productivity gap with our competitors as an opportunity. They say it gives us, "increased room for catch-up". To avoid catch-up problems in the public services the Chancellor says that he is going to have new reviews and reports, targets, procedures and checks, and inspectors and audits. But in a striking passage in the Statement on the subject of value for money in the public services, the Minister described a system of rewards and punishment that would follow success and failure in delivery. In saying that he reminded us of what the Chief Secretary said; that is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Money will only be released if the Government are satisfied we are getting the returns we want".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-07_para88"></a>That was four years ago.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para89"></a>Do the Government think they will increase the productivity of the public services if they issue a new regulation every 20 minutes, as they do for business? Or will they issue 4,440 pages to hospitals next year&#151;17 pages of rules every day&#151;as they did to schools last year? Or will it be a czar that will make all the difference or a new No. 10 delivery unit? The public can see that the strategy has not worked and they can see why; that is, without real reform spending is not the answer.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para90"></a>Perhaps I can leave to one side the question of why the spending does not seem to have worked and why people may be disappointed with the results and turn to another aspect of the Statement which may be equally of interest. It concerns the effect of the failed spending effort on the economy as a whole. Let us consider the example the Government are setting to households in Britain. They say in the Statement that we can spend more than our income. So with <P>


<a name="column_990"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government income (on their own estimates) growing by 2.5 per cent, they will spend 4.3 per cent more a year. The public duly take their cue.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para91"></a>The size of outstanding household debt, including mortgage debt, has soared. As a ratio of annual disposable income it is at an all-time high at more than 100 per cent. Non-mortgage consumer credit is growing at 12.4 per cent a year while mortgage lending is growing at 9 per cent a year. As with the Government, underlying incomes are growing more slowly at only 5 per cent, so household finances are becoming stretched. So are the Government's.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para92"></a>How much more will the Government need to borrow to meet the plans we heard set out in the Statement? The Statement said that the spending plans were possible because of what the Government had achieved in debt reduction. Why then do the Government plan to borrow over the next five years twice as much as they repaid in debt in their first few years? That is according to their own figures. More realistically, according to economists, undershooting tax revenues because of an economic slow-down suggests that we could expect the PSNB to approach £20 billion this year, £30 billion next year and £35 billion in 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para93"></a>As we are all aware, independent forecasters have been steadily downgrading predictions for GDP growth this year. Consensus expectations have dropped to 1.7 per cent compared with 1.8 per cent in June. Some forecasts are now as low as 1.2 per cent. Remember, the Chancellor's Budget forecast on which this spending plan is based is for a growth of 2.5 per cent this year and 3 to 3.5 per cent next year.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para94"></a>The spending plans in the Statement threaten all the theoretical economic foundations on which the Chancellor's framework is built. The framework's three main pillars&#151;the independence of the Bank of England, the symmetrical inflation target and the code for fiscal stability&#151;are all much less solid than the Minister might like to think.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para95"></a>Can we be saved by the EU and its growth and stability pact which sets limits on government spending? I doubt that. The pact only applies to small countries. For big countries, as Francis Mer, the new Finance Minister of France, said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Le pacte de stabiliteÿ Europeÿest pas inscrit dans le marbre".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-07_para96"></a>So we are not going to endorse the Government's failed approach to public services today. Our Benches will not support their policy of spending without change. That does not mean that we are against spending more on education and the other services the Minister described. But we are against his plans to spend more without real reform because, as the record seems to show, it does not work.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para97"></a>If this gathering gloom were not enough, the Chancellor will soon face a stark reminder of the dark days of industrial strife. On 17th July 1.3 million public sector workers, supposed to be the beneficiaries of the Statement, are planning a one-day pay strike&#151;the biggest industrial action for more than 20 years. The Government must be disappointed. If they would tax more, spend more and achieve something, that would <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be fine. If they would tax less, spend less and leave things alone, that would be finer still for some. But to tax more, spend more and make things worse is not going to be acceptable for long. O si sic omnes: if only everyone were sick of it.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches in general welcome the principles which underlie the Comprehensive Spending Review; namely, the need for greater levels of expenditure on our main public services and, secondly, the need to raise levels of general taxation which provide for that. That was the basis on which we fought the election (incidentally, it was not the basis on which the Government fought the election) because we believed that the key concerns of all sectors of British society&#151;prosperous Britain, middle Britain and poorer Britain&#151;had to do with the quality of public services which they were receiving. The quality of private goods and services they bought were often much higher than the public goods and services from which they benefited and, as with consumer goods, they wanted better quality services and were prepared to pay for them.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para98"></a>As consumers of public services we all want to know two principal things. First, how well will our taxes be spent; secondly, how fairly will our taxes be raised?
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para99"></a>Today is not primarily about raising taxes, although the level of planned increase in expenditure raises important issues about what happens if the Government's growth targets are not met and also what happens at the end of the period. Have we reached nirvana at the end of the CSR period or are further expenditure and tax increases planned?
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para100"></a>Today's key questions relate to how effectively the increased expenditure is distributed. In my view it is hardly surprising that up to now we have not had much to see for the increased spending under this Government, at least in some services. In 1999 many institutions were in debt, and in the case of schools, many of them illegally so. Many staff, particularly at the lower end of the scale, were extremely badly paid. I cannot disagree too strongly with what the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, said on Friday in criticising the Government for allowing public sector pay to increase compared with private sector comparators. The Tories, as an act of policy, held down public sector pay disgracefully, and a correction was sorely needed. So much of the increased expenditure of the past three years has been making up the ravages of what went before.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para101"></a>For the period of the CSR, very large additional amounts will be spent and we must see results. The Government seek to improve their effectiveness by organisational change and, even more importantly, by targets. Why should we believe that the targets will be more effective in the future than in the past? A large proportion of the targets set under the Government's public service agreement have simply not been met. The 1945 Labour government believed that the gentlemen in Whitehall knew best; this Government <P>


<a name="column_992"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 992</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tend to believe that only the gentlemen&#151;it is still nearly always gentlemen&#151;in the Treasury know best and they are setting down ever more targets for hard-pressed public sector workers to follow.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para102"></a>How do the Government believe that the changes that they seek can be met by micro-management from Whitehall? What kind of sense provides for no political accountability, for example, in the health service between the lowest organisational level and the Secretary of State? Why, for example, did the Government in the recent White Paper on regional government envisage that in health and in education, to name but two, there would be virtually no role for regional assemblies? When the Statement says that they seek to reverse decades of indifference and neglect of our regions by modest increases in the budgets of RDAs, who are they kidding? People across the regions need to be engaged; it cannot be done simply by giving a little more money to unelected RDAs.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para103"></a>On the subject of local democracy, is it a coincidence that the only time the phrase "local authority" appears in the Statement is when the Government explain what they will do with local authorities that appear to have failed? On the general matter of delivery and the allocation of resources, why does the review contain no review of the Barnett formula? Why is there no attempt to match grants for the English regions to their specific needs?
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para104"></a>On education I have two questions. First, when the Government talk about 1,400 secondary schools receiving an additional payment of £125,000 direct to each school, they refer to schools that will,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"match demanding new performance targets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-07_para105"></a>What on earth does that mean? Does it mean that those schools are failing schools which they want to improve? Does it mean that they are specialist schools that they want to become beacons? Does it mean that they are educational priority schools? The paragraph is typical government speak which, frankly, is completely incomprehensible at first sight.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para106"></a>Secondly, where does the CSR leave the Government's plans for 50 per cent of school leavers to attend university? Why will the Government not admit that the negligible increase in numbers applying to universities in England last year&#151;less than 1 per cent&#151;was because many potential students from poorer families feared that a debt of £12,000 to £15,000 at the end of their studies was insupportable?
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para107"></a>In the absence of a greater willingness on the part of government to devolve decision making in public services, to set professionals free to manage without constant interference from Whitehall and to give local communities greater say, our fear is that the justifiable increases in expenditure in this review will not be most effectively spent and that the case for well-funded, universally available public services will be seriously damaged. The challenge for the Government is to prove that fear unfounded.

<A NAME="20715-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, on Friday when we had a rather short, ill attended, but high-quality debate on the Finance Bill. I was impressed by how little either opposition party had learned about the way in which Finance Bills are constructed or the way in which the 2002 Budget was constructed. Today I am reassured in the sense that both the noble Lords, Lord Saatchi and Lord Newby, in their speeches, appear to have taken account of what I said on Friday. But, so far as I can see, they have not taken any account of what the Chancellor said today. Perhaps we need another debate so that they can catch up.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para108"></a>In what appeared to me&#151;I know that I am prejudiced, but you will allow that&#151;to be an outstanding description, not only of plans for the future, of resources, and of targets, but also of achievement over the past five years, the Chancellor, every time he addressed an issue of public policy or an issue of public service, was saying not only what we shall do over the next three years, but also what we have done over the past five years.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para109"></a>What did noble Lords opposite believe that the Chancellor was saying about primary schools? Do they not believe that increases in literacy targets are important? What did they believe was being said about the growth in employment, the closing of the employment trap, the way in which we have, over the past five years, attained a figure of a million and a half more people in work? That could be done with a favourable economy inherited from a benign previous government; it could all be to the credit of Mr Kenneth Clarke. But that excuse has now worn thin. The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, knows that that is not true, as does the noble Lord, Lord Newby.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para110"></a>They know that what is true is that there has been an increase in employment and that we have the lowest unemployment in the developed world because of the policies of this Government. The Government have made that possible through economic stability, through the minimum wage, through making work pay, through employment credits and through the encouragement of business and manufacturing industry. The Government have achieved those extraordinarily&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;successful results. I heard in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, no recognition, and in that of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, little recognition of that catalogue of success that the Chancellor was able to give to the House of Commons this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para111"></a>Every time the Chancellor talked about increased spending, he talked about improved performance. I take the example of health, although that was dealt with in more detail at the time of the Budget rather than in the Statement. The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, says that increased expenditure on health is accounted for by higher wages. The increase has not resulted in higher wages per doctor, but there is a higher wages bill because we have more doctors, more nurses and more people working in our hospitals and because more operations are being carried out and more patients are being treated. That is the reason for higher expenditure in our National Health Service.
<P>


<a name="column_994"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 994</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para112"></a>I wrote down in capital letters what the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, said as it struck me as a real give-away: "Without real reform spending is not the answer". Later he said, "We will not support spending without change". What on earth did he believe the Chancellor was saying? What was the 30-minute Statement about except to say that without real reform spending is not the answer and the corollary that without a commitment to the resources necessary all talk of reform is a sham. Frankly, unless the Conservative Party makes up its mind whether it supports the expenditure that we believe necessary for our public services and unless it either supports or says what it will do if it does not support us on the spending plans, no one will listen to what it says about reform.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para113"></a>Dr Liam Fox has wandered around Europe. He has come to a stop in Germany. Apparently he thinks that the peculiar blend of social insurance which Germany has&#151;and which has been working rather badly since the incorporation of East Germany&#151;is the solution. He will come forward to us with that solution in due course.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para114"></a>We know&#151;because we know the truth and it became apparent&#151;that Dr Fox's idea was first to convince people that the health service was not working in order to convince them that there was some magical solution other than public expenditure on health.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para115"></a>I do not think that much has been learned by the party opposite in the past five years. The same old charges come up. The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, talked about 11 per cent public sector inflation. Public spending has risen overall by only 2.1 per cent in real terms each year over the past five years. Higher expenditure on services is due to the low growth in social security and the huge fall each year in debt interest payments. Public sector pay, which the noble Lord believes is where all the money will go, is projected to rise by just 1.6 per cent in real terms each year. So public expenditure is not being swallowed up by pay.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para116"></a>The accusation, which is never quite openly made, is that somehow we are working towards a crisis in our public finances and that it will all end in grief. The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, did not quite come out in the open with that. He knows as well as I&#151;and as the House knows perfectly well&#151;that our projections for the period up to 2006 show us with a credit balance. At every stage in the past five years we have said that we would have one. We have proved that to be right.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para117"></a>In the Red Books of the last couple of Conservative Chancellors&#151;I shall say only the last couple in order to be kind to some of the earlier ones&#151;the public finances projections made have proved every time to be not just over-optimistic but wildly over-optimistic. They were never achieved year on year. Ours have always been achieved.
<P>

<a name="20715-07_para118"></a>Fundamentally, our targets are about setting clear goals for services. There is not a multiplicity of targets. Public spending agreements have gone down from 200 to 130. They let devolved management get on with the <P>


<a name="column_995"></a>

Does my noble friend the Minister discern the determination by Her Majesty's Government to promote, assist and defend Britain's manufacturing base? I remind my noble friend of the difficulties of the steel industry in Britain, and not least of the many jobs lost in Wales. Does my noble friend agree that Britain's premier exporting industry&#151; aerospace&#151;is worthy of a larger grant for research and development? A Britain shorn of her manufacturing will lose her greatness. But I end as I begin&#151;overall, it is a remarkable and welcome Statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Jones for what he says about the Statement in general. I acknowledge the difficulty through which manufacturing industry has been going, and in particular the industries to which he refers. He will have been as encouraged as I was to learn that after a difficult period we are returning to growth in manufacturing industry. After a period of virtually no growth since the year 2000 there are signs of an upturn in manufacturing industry.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para0"></a>My noble friend will also appreciate&#151;he will have a chance to read this in more detail&#151;that the spending review encourages manufacturing industry at its base rather than at the front line. It is the increase in the science budget, the reforms in science teaching and the credits for research and development which are surely the way that a manufacturing industry in the future&#151;which may not be the same as a manufacturing industry in the past&#151;will flourish. That is what the Chancellor is determined to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that the Chancellor in his speech claimed credit for his prudence and good management in reducing the public debt to a level below that achieved by many governments in the past? What he failed to do was to explain on any of these occasions how he managed to do it. Of course the reduction in public debt was largely due to the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unanticipated Spectrum receipts",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-08_para1"></a>to which he did not refer, which as one can glean from the Red Book with care, amounted to a reduction of £22 billion&#151;£22,000 million. The Government achieved that windfall by the sale of licences for the use of telephones. The Chancellor has never given any credit to that sum in his financial statements, which he frequently makes about the reduction of government debt.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para2"></a>Does the Minister feel that if the Chancellor were more frank about that windfall profit&#151;and came clean instead of claiming prudence and good management&#151;there would be more belief and more trust in the figures that he has quoted today?

<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I start by expressing surprise that such a distinguished capitalist as the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, who ran a major bank with great distinction for a number years, should object to the Government getting £22 billion by selling Spectrum. I should have thought that he would be rather pleased about it.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para3"></a>The Government have always recognised that a significant part of the improvement in the public finances came from the sale of Spectrum. But by no means mostly, as the noble Lord would have us believe. It was a one off. If it can be achieved again for a fourth generation, I hope that we shall have his support.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para4"></a>The improvement in the public finances is much greater than the result of Spectrum's sales. The improvement in them by the reduction in payments for unemployment is much greater. The social as well as the financial effects are of enormous importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walker of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, in his Statement the Chancellor stressed the importance of encouraging voluntary movements. There is perhaps no greater example of voluntary effort in this country than the hospice movement. Is the Minister aware that when the Government came to power 40 per cent of capital and current expenditure of the hospice movement was funded from public expenditure? It has been reduced every year and is now down to below 28 per cent. Is there any chance that as a result of this Statement the hospice movement will start to receive the assistance that it used to receive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am as strong a supporter of the hospice movement as is the noble Lord, Lord Walker. I think that the noble Lord may be a patron of the North London Hospice, as I am and as is the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher. I cannot remember: it is a long list. I agree with the noble Lord that public expenditure is of enormous importance. It is difficult for the hospice movement because so much of it is labour-intensive. Clearly, it is as important for the hospice movement as it is for home care for the elderly and the disabled.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para5"></a> I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Walker, will have noticed that in the spending review Statement reference was made to the £125 million extra which is to be made available to the voluntary and charitable sector for the public services it performs. I can assure him that hospices come under the definition of public services performed by the voluntary and charitable sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say how unequivocally pleased we are that extra money is going to education. That is long overdue and the extra £15 billion is vital if we are to maintain our competitiveness worldwide. How much of that money will go directly to schools and how much will go through local education authorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Chancellor gave the <P>


<a name="column_997"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 997</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>detailed figures for how much will go to each school. I suppose that I could add them all up and multiply by 3,500 secondary schools to give the noble Baroness a figure, but that would be unfair. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills will make a Statement tomorrow and it is better if that comes authoritatively from her rather than from me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Statement. It was a broad Statement which by any objective assessment could have been made only by a Chancellor who was successful in his position, as the present Chancellor surely is and has been in running the economy since 1997.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para6"></a>My noble friend said that schools and hospitals come first, as they surely must. I certainly welcome that, but I also welcome the fact that the third leg of the stool, as it were, in the Statement was housing. Without decent housing, the first two services are difficult to deliver for children. As chairman of the Housing Corporation, I welcome the confidence that the Statement gives us about delivery in the difficult circumstances of increased housing needs and deprivation. I look forward to the Statement promised on Thursday by my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister on planning and the whole area of housing.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is my turn, I think. I am of course grateful to my noble friend, who has been a distinguished chairman of the Housing Corporation for several years. With his characteristic modesty, my right honourable friend the Chancellor did not spell out what the increased housing expenditure will actually mean. I understand that it will mean virtually a doubling of the Housing Corporation's budget by 2005&#150;06, which is an extraordinary change in the level of support for public housing.
<P>

<a name="20715-08_para7"></a>I am sure that my noble friend and the corporation will use that money wisely to deal with the long overdue problems of repair to existing housing and to secure affordable housing for people, especially in the South East of the country, for whom it is short. The lack of such housing is affecting our productivity. That is now up to the Housing Corporation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I am an innocent in these matters and I listened to the Statement with wonderment. I wondered whether the heading at its top was not, "All this and heaven too". It seems important to an ordinary person such as me to know what the Government will have borrowed by 2006.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness does herself an injustice, but the answer is that borrowing will still be in within the limits that we have always set. We have always said that there will be no net borrowing for revenue purposes over the course of the economic cycle. At the same time, we have said <P>


<a name="column_998"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 998</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that borrowing for investment&#151;in other words, for capital&#151;which is now properly distinguished from revenue under the resource accounting being introduced this year, will be increased. I hope that the noble Baroness agrees that that is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister detect the Chancellor's characteristic modesty when he did not allow himself to spell out whether the extra money that he will provide for policing takes account of the deepening crisis in police pensions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, once again, the extra money being provided for policing will be much better dealt with in detail in the Home Secretary's Statement on Wednesday, but it provides for an increase in live policing, so to speak, rather than pensions funding, up to 130,000 police. Clearly, the proportion of money going to policing that goes on police pensions is a matter of continuing concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, first, I apologise to my noble friend because I have been upstairs in a Select Committee and was unable to be present earlier. Given that, as I understand it, there is to be major reform along with the welcome increase in expenditure, does that reform include the abolition of the Barnett formula?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, my Lords, there is no suggestion of the abolition of the Barnett formula. If there were to be such a change, it would not take place in the context of a spending review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-08_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us a little more about the inspection arrangements, which I believe are to be introduced in health and education to ensure that the Government's targets are met? Will those inspectorates be statutory bodies or will they be related to the auditing services?

<A NAME="20715-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I hope for the sake of all of us in the House that most of the things to be done will not involve primary legislation. We are sometimes too ready to embark on new primary legislation instead of making better use of the tools that we have. No, the real thrust will be in improved use of existing audit and accountancy bodies&#151;the National Audit Office, which, of course, is not under government control, the Audit Commission and so on.

<A NAME="20715-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, my Lords, not really. That matter will become more apparent in the Statement to be made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. The Chancellor allowed himself&#151;and I do not blame him, because it is a matter of enormous importance&#151;to be a little more expansive about resources for science, research and the budgets of the research councils. Of course, that forms a significant part of expenditure on higher education. My right honourable friend went into some detail about that in the Statement, but for the sort of more detailed analysis for which the noble Lord asks, it is better to await the Statement from the relevant Secretary of State.

<a name="20715-09_para1"></a>Clause 44 [Conditions of support]:
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para2"></a>[Amendment No. 142A not moved.]
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para3"></a>Clause 44 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para4"></a>Clause 45 [Choice of form of support]:
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 45 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I rise to oppose the Question that Clause 45 stand part of the Bill. The clause is headed "Choice of form of support". It should be headed, "No choice of form of support, except for the Home Secretary and his departmental organisations". Although it refers to about five different forms of support, the clause is really about the choice between NASS accommodation in what is now the traditional dispersed form and accommodation centres. There are echoes of the question of whether cash-only support should be abolished. We discussed that issue on the previous clause, and the cash-only option stands as a matter of difference between parts of the Committee. No doubt we shall return to it.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para6"></a>The clause is about whether someone who comes to this country and applies for asylum should be sent to dispersed NASS accommodation; a block of flats in Glasgow; a terraced house in Leeds or whatever, or whether he should go to a new accommodation centre. The difference between us is that the Government are proposing not only that the asylum seeker will not make the decision and will not have a free choice in the matter&#151;which is reasonable&#151;but also that the asylum seeker's circumstances and wishes are not to be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para7"></a> Of course, that is already the case with some people who are sent straight to Oakington, but they are special cases that the Government believe to have no merit whatever&#151;although they are not always right&#151;<P>


<a name="column_1000"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that can be dealt with quickly. However, we are talking here not about people who are locked in a detention centre while their cases are dealt with quickly, but about people who may be here for two to six months&#151;or perhaps longer&#151;even under the new super efficient system that we are promised, before their initial decision is reached.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para8"></a>The assumption behind what the Government are saying is that no one applying for asylum in this country will ever want to live in one of the new trial accommodation centres. In another place on 14th May the Minister&#151;who was Angela Eagle before the Home Office had one of its frequent throwing-balls-in-the-air-and-seeing-who-comes-down&#151;said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Committee will agree that it would be nonsense for accommodation centres to run at half capacity because people have chosen dispersal".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Committee E, 14/5/02; col. 220.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-09_para9"></a>
I would not disagree. If accommodation centres are to be provided, it is sensible that they should be run as close to capacity as possible. No one disagrees.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para10"></a> The disagreement is over the suggestion that the new accommodation centres, with what we are promised will be excellent facilities on site, able to deal and cope with the needs of asylum seekers in a secure and safe environment, will be unpopular with those seeking asylum. I do not believe that they will. Some of those coming from the other side of the world to a country about which they know nothing, having never heard of Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, or even Nelson, given the choice of a safe, secure environment with facilities on site, will say, "We'd prefer that to being sent somewhere we have never heard of. We don't know who else is going to be there; we don't know where it is; it is more of the unknown".
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para11"></a>As noble Lords have said, many people who come have suffered a great deal of trauma. The fact that a high proportion of asylum seekers are now young men leads people to believe that they do not necessarily suffer the same traumas as older people and families with children. My experience is that that is not the case. They are often frightened of the future: they do not know what is going to happen. They are often worried sick about the rest of their family and relatives, perhaps even wives and children back home. Some are suffering from mental illnesses and most have had great shocks to their system. The process of arriving here is extremely traumatic for many of them.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para12"></a> Under those circumstances, I believe that at least some of them would prefer the safety and security of accommodation centres. We have discussed accommodation centres at great length. Some of us do not share the utter aversion to them that exists in other quarters. Given the Government's propensity to turn a good idea into a mess, I am not sure that we will hold that view once the accommodation centres have been operating for a while. We will have to see. We will assess them in a fair and honest way. But we do not oppose the principle of accommodation centres. We support their proposed trials, but not necessarily all the details.
<P>


<a name="column_1001"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1001</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para13"></a>However, other people will be coming in for whom dispersal is the most sensible option because they have family, friends or community in this country. Therefore, where subsection (3)(a) suggests that the Secretary of State may,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have regard to administrative or other matters which do not concern the person's personal circumstances",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-09_para14"></a>
the wording rings alarm bells. The absence from subsection (3) of any reference to the asylum seeker's personal circumstances being one of the issues taken into account is worrying.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para15"></a> In another place, the same Minister said that not to include this clause would cause "administrative havoc". That is surely putting the point too strongly. By choosing the best option for individual asylum seekers one may avoid administrative problems and create a situation in which people will be the least unhappy with their circumstances. That must be conducive to quick and sensible decision making.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para16"></a>The whole clause is misconceived in the way it is set out. We are not suggesting that asylum seekers should have an absolute right to choose, but they should be told what the options are and have the opportunity to put forward a preference that can be taken into account when the decision is made. The decision may not be the one they want, but their circumstances and preferences should be taken into account. The clause as it stands seems to preclude that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I want to spell out what we understand Clause 45 to mean in the circumstances raised by the noble Lord. I want to place clear lines on the public record so that there can be no misunderstanding in future.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para17"></a>Clause 45 deals with the choice of forms of support offered to destitute asylum seekers. It gives effect to our policy that support is provided on a no-choice basis. We have been clear about that from the outset. The Secretary of State will make the decision about where to provide support.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para18"></a>Given some of the concerns expressed in another place and referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, it may be helpful if I emphasise that Clause 45(3) is not intended to list in order of priority the issues to which the Secretary of State should have regard when determining which provision to offer support under. It is intended to make it clear that the Secretary of State may lawfully have regard to several matters that are unrelated to personal circumstances for administrative reasons, such as running an effective asylum support system or for the purposes of the trial. That does not absolve the Secretary of State from his obligation to act reasonably in the circumstances. We have every intention of taking account of personal circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para19"></a>It may help the Committee if I try to provide some idea of how we envisage using Clause 45(3). We will allocate places in accommodation centres to people according to their personal circumstances, the language that they speak and the size of their family group. However, during the trial period, we will have only a limited number of places, and we are likely to need to take into account additional factors that are <P>


<a name="column_1002"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1002</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unrelated to personal circumstances. That is why we have included the express power to allow us to take non-personal circumstances into account and to regard such matters as conclusive.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para20"></a>The White Paper said that we might want to limit the allocation of accommodation centre places to those arriving at particular ports of entry or induction centres. That may assist in the early days of the trial, as capacity is built up, and may also foster links between, on the one hand, ports and induction centres and, on the other, particular accommodation centres. That would ease the process for all concerned. Clearly, the port of arrival is not linked to someone's personal circumstances, which is why we need subsection (3)(b). If we say that speakers of a particular language can be accommodated at the centres, one way of deciding which people should go to an accommodation centre would be to link the decision to the port of entry.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para21"></a>I need hardly remind the Committee that, at the outset, we will have only 3,000 places at accommodation centres. It may be that we allocate person A to an accommodation centre and person B, who came through a different port but whose case is similar in other respects, to dispersal accommodation. Under Clause 45(3), that would be entirely right and proper. There might be nothing in the personal circumstances of those two people to distinguish them from each other, but paragraph (b) allows us to treat the port of entry as a conclusive factor in determining whether someone goes to a centre or to dispersal accommodation.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para22"></a>Subsection (3)(c) allows us to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"apply different criteria to different persons for administrative reasons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-09_para23"></a>It assists us to trial the new system by permitting us to allocate one person support in an accommodation centre and another person with the same or similar needs support in dispersal accommodation.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para24"></a>Inevitably, some asylum seekers will express a preference as to whether they wish to be supported in an accommodation centre because that would suit their needs exactly or in dispersed accommodation. They may express a preference to live in a particular part of the country. As the Minister in another place said, it is the case that personal preference would be taken into account, although it might not be the primary consideration.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para25"></a>I shall make the position clear. We will, of course, listen to any comments made, but asylum seekers will not be able to decide the method of support that will be used or the location in which they will be supported. We could not run an efficient system on that basis. However, a preference may be based on someone's personal circumstances. For example, a person might say that he wished to be supported where he could attend hospital regularly, as part of continuing treatment. It would be right for us to take that into account when deciding where to offer support&#151;an accommodation centre or in a dispersal area.
<P>

<a name="20715-09_para26"></a>I shall make the distinction clear: personal circumstances will be taken into account, in so far as they have an impact on support-related issues, but <P>


<a name="column_1003"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pure personal preference as to the type of support will not be taken into account. We will, of course, be sensitive to the needs of individuals, but we must retain the flexibility to allocate in such a way as to make the system efficient and to ensure that we make the best use of it. That is the intention of the clause. It is best left as it is and best left in the Bill to do that job.

Can the Minister explain why it is right to do that for asylum seekers but not for British subjects?

<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation of the clause. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that it is a pity that there is no reference in the clause to personal circumstances. Will the Government reflect on whether they might be able to incorporate such a reference by a future amendment? Will the Minister write to me to tell me whether there is any good precedent in legislation elsewhere for subsection (3)(c), which refers to the application of different criteria for different persons?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has made an interesting point, but I am not sure how he envisages that the system would work, were we to go along with his general drift. I will read carefully what the noble Lord said and consider the point that he is trying to make, but I cannot undertake to satisfy him on that point. I will, of course, write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para0"></a> The answer to the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is that we seek to make it crystal clear that our policy for support for asylum seekers will operate on a no-choice basis. I must also make it clear that refugees have the same rights, once granted status, as those who are settled here. In operating an asylum system&#151;whether it be for asylum seekers who end up in accommodation centres or dispersal areas&#151;we must, in the circumstances, be the judge of how to make the best use of a generous but finite resource. The Bill will allow for that, and that is right. It would be a negligent government that did not seek to make good and efficient use of the resources at their disposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I thank the Minister for a useful, helpful and clear statement of the extent to which personal circumstances will be taken into account. It will be helpful to have that on the record. I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in suggesting that the Government might consider putting a reference into the clause. In the light of what the Minister said, such a reference would probably make no difference to what will happen, but it would, at least, be in the Bill, and we would not have to rely on what the Minister said today.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-10_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: There is a good deal of work to be done in giving advice to asylum seekers. Many of them are badly in need of it, partly because of ignorance, partly because of the effects of trauma and partly because of the difficulty of coming to terms with things that have happened to them and which may cost a great effort of will to remember. I know one or two people who are in that position and who still have difficulty in allowing themselves to remember what happened to them three or more years after the event.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para6"></a>All this could prove a severe burden on the facilities of an accommodation centre, which will be otherwise occupied. Granting the amendment might save the Government a good deal of trouble. In their own interests as well as those of asylum seekers, they would be well advised to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I support all that has been said by the noble Earl. It is very important to ensure that, where appropriate, the asylum seeker should be able to see his or her lawyer. The present regulations that obtain, contrary to assurances given elsewhere, make no proper provision for people to obtain reimbursement for their travel costs.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para7"></a>It is equally important for witnesses to be able to go to a lawyer in order to make statements. No provision is made for that when it comes to an asylum seeker's appeal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Would the noble Earl, Lord Russell, clarify a point for me? In the amendment he refers to "a voluntary organisation", which is a very wide expression. The amendment suggests that the Secretary of State should,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"make a grant available to a voluntary organisation which provides . . . advice or assistance to persons who have a right of appeal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-10_para8"></a>Obviously that means legal advice or assistance. Does the noble Earl include firms of solicitors under the expression "voluntary organisation"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The amendment is not concerned specifically with legal advice. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, will remember our debate on the first day in <P>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1005</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee when we discussed separately the provision of legal advice, to which he made a helpful contribution. This amendment refers more to questions involving the welfare of asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para9"></a>I should have declared an interest in this matter since I am the patron of the Association of Visitors of Immigration Detainees. It is an extremely valuable body undertaking the same kind of visiting as that carried out in prisons, only one hopes in slightly better conditions. The association has done a great deal to mediate in matters of misunderstanding between asylum seekers and governors at the centres or, in some cases where they have been involved, the governors of prisons.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para10"></a>I refer here also to organisations concerned with refugee health such as the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and organisations of more general concern such as the Refugee Council. Above all, I refer to the Christian Churches whose contribution in this area I honour and respect deeply. A wide range of organisations is involved, quite apart from lawyers.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para11"></a>One thing that has most impressed me and which has helped me to keep up my pride in my own country through a series of blows to it is the immensely high standard of those voluntary organisations that do involve themselves with refugees, providing them with a welcome, advice and support, but often simply listening to them, which sometimes is most important of all.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para12"></a>I hope that I have clarified the point for the noble Lord, Lord Renton. I am very much concerned with legal advice, but I believe that we have already dealt with it. Furthermore, I do not think that I would have chosen to describe solicitors under the heading, "voluntary organisation". They might be involuntary, but let us not split hairs on the point.

<FONT SIZE=3>the need for new legislation? Can he also say whether there are any other examples of voluntary organisations being asked to return money they have not spent? I do not know the answer to that question at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I am slightly puzzled by the amendment. The noble Earl mentioned the Refugee Council. However, the council&#151;for which I worked for some years until 1994&#151;has been receiving money from the Home Office precisely for welfare and advice services. Unless something has changed recently, I should have thought that the amendment describes the present position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   That is correct. The amendment describes the position as I hope it will remain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-10_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   Perhaps I may make a brief point in relation to a number of organisations which have been advantageous to the Home Office in regard to their representations on behalf of those least able to make representations themselves.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para15"></a>I do not know whether the Minister heard the Radio 4 programme broadcast yesterday on NASS. The organisation was described as one of the most bureaucratic government bodies in the country. I believe that even the former Minister at the Home Office, named as Angela Eagle on the programme, expressed her serious concerns in regard to the way that NASS was operating.
<P>

<a name="20715-10_para16"></a>However, what greatly concerns me is that many organisations are living from hand to mouth and are in desperate need of funds to provide advice and to make representations. It is in the Government's interest to ensure that funds are made available in order to make the work of such organisations that much easier.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall resist the temptation to respond to all the points that are somewhat adjacent to the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, except to pick up on the matter raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, on grant aid and new legislation. Much legislation on the statute book enables Secretaries of State across government departments to provide grant aid in different forms. I am sure that new legislation is not always required to open up yet another pot of funding. A great deal of flexibility is built into the workings of such schemes. Furthermore, I am sure that noble Lords will join my noble friend Lord Judd in welcoming the additional sums announced today by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It may well be that new and additional services are required as a result of this and other legislation in a similar field. Some of those voluntary organisations may wish to apply for assistance funding.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para0"></a>I return to the main point of the amendment. We certainly understand the concerns expressed by the noble Earl. Putting it frankly, I am aware that asylum support adjudicators have called for legal advice to be <P>


<a name="column_1007"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1007</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made available. It is believed that they are particularly concerned with regard to cases involving the early termination of support.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para1"></a>Generally speaking, the reason for early termination of support is based on fact. The asylum seeker will have left his accommodation or would have breached a condition on which such support was predicated. All asylum seekers are informed of the conditions on which support is offered. Additional briefing provided during the induction centre process reinforces that message. If asylum seekers choose to ignore this information, they must be prepared to shoulder responsibility and accept the consequences.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para2"></a>It would be a nonsense for the Home Office to grant fund the provision of welfare services to asylum seekers who are appealing against a decision to terminate their support early because they failed to abide by the terms under which the support was offered. Had they abided by the terms, they would have continued to be supported. For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para3"></a>It should be understood that the Government support a number of organisations which offer different and varied advice to asylum seekers and those seeking asylum in this country. We have been praised widely for doing so. However, a line has to be drawn. We believe that we are right in drawing that line in this case. I am unable to accept the noble Earl's amendment, although I understand the spirit in which it was moved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Is there any discretion at all in the enforcement of the rules of support? I understand the Minister's position. But let us suppose that a man's cousin and only surviving relative has had a heart attack, his life is in immediate danger and the asylum seeker ignores the curfew in order to go out to visit his cousin because it may be the last time that he will ever see any living relation. When you have seen most of your relations killed, your attachment to those that survive can become very intense because it is an attachment to the whole of your past and your sense of place. One would have thought that representations for mercy might be made in that kind of case. Is that question being considered? If not, there is a strong case for asking the Government to think very seriously about whether it should be considered in the future.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para4"></a>I was told at Yale that all Yale rules should be construed to contain the word "normally". When the Minister enunciates rules of support, one wonders whether he may perhaps consider them to contain the word "normally". The kind of situation I have envisaged will not happen often but it is almost certain that it will happen at least once that an asylum seeker in accommodation will go off and try to visit the dying person&#151;or possibly recovering person&#151;while he has the chance to do so because he knows that he will never have the chance to do so again. I am not asking for a very big thing but it is an area where the action of an intermediary could be extremely important. While the matter is under urgent consideration, I hope that the <P>


<a name="column_1008"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1008</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister will at least say that he understands why I am making this request of him. I do not think that it is altogether unreasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   When the noble Earl made his first comments on this issue my mind went back some 20 or so years to a time when I was a legal adviser in a law centre where there were a number of Chilean refugees. The noble Earl referred to the effect of trauma, torture and mistreatment on people. From talking to people who came here as refugees fleeing the Chilean regime and who have now lived in this country for 20 years and more, I know that they greatly welcomed the support and aid that they received. They still find it very hard to talk in detail about the trauma they experienced and the impact it had upon them.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para5"></a>Where a person can provide a reasonable excuse for a breach of regulations&#151;perhaps in the circumstances enunciated by the noble Earl&#151;termination of support would not be thought right. In the circumstances described by the noble Earl, and taking into account some of the points he made about the impact that traumatic flight may have on people, there would be an element of flexibility. For that reason&#151;this underpins the point I made earlier&#151;the amendment is not necessary. It does not add anything to the way in which we expect the law to operate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   For once in a blue moon I am relieved to be told that my amendment is not necessary. I thank the Minister warmly for what he said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-11_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment concerns attendance at appeals. As it stands at present, the Bill states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may pay reasonable travelling expenses incurred by an appellant in connection with attendance for the purposes of an appeal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-11_para8"></a>The amendment seeks to change the word "may" to "shall" and allows for the attendance of witnesses.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para9"></a>In the case I have just described, it is perfectly possible that an intensive care nurse from the hospital may be asked to attend as a witness and incur considerable travelling expenses. Nurses pay is not so generous that they can afford large train fares at the drop of a hat. I hope the Minister will find the amendment worthy of consideration. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I apologise for anticipating rather too early in the debate inspired by the noble Earl. I do not imagine that my noble friend will be able to make the concession in the terms asked for by the noble Earl. However, the amendment gives him an opportunity to state the policy that will be followed by the Secretary of State. I hope that asylum seekers and their witnesses will have the opportunity to see the lawyers of their choice. That being so, it may, in a <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I shall be very surprised if the Minister can accept the first amendment in this group and I am doubtful about the other two. I wonder whether the noble Earl, Lord Russell, realises that the Secretary of State may at an early stage have information which enables him to realise that the person seeking asylum is bogus. In those circumstances, stating that the Secretary of State "shall" pay travel expenses and other matters would be utterly wrong. We must leave the discretion with the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I do not have with me Section 103 of the 1999 Act but I strongly suspect that this refers, as does the remainder of the clause, to asylum support appeals only. If that is the case, an amendment of this kind should go much wider. That is why I moved and withdrew an amendment which was designed to be much wider. It referred not only to benefit support appeals but to other kinds of asylum and immigration appeals in the interests of getting the best possible quality of decisions, thereby avoiding subsequent appeals and cases for judicial review. Will the Government attempt to widen this principle to affect more of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The intervention of my noble friend Lord Renton has made it possible for me to be succinct. I simply wanted to ask on what basis the Secretary of State would refuse to pay travelling expenses. My noble friend put the question in the proper context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It might be helpful if I were to spell out the circumstances surrounding the provision of and access to legal advice that we envisage. It is worth putting on the record that we are committed to providing access to legal advice at all stages of the asylum process. We have made that clear before. Advice will be provided in accommodation centres either by lawyers or advisers based on site or by co-ordinated local advice services. Advice will be provided by the Legal Services Commission which will let specific contracts for the purpose. In general, asylum seekers will not need to travel from an accommodation centre to receive legal advice. If they or others who are not in an accommodation centre need to do so, travel costs may be refunded by the existing legal aid system.
<P>

<a name="20715-11_para10"></a>We have also ensured that adequate powers are there to enable the funding and grant-aiding of legal support and advice. Section 111 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 currently enables the Secretary of State to make grants to voluntary organisations, as is well known. Clause 97 of the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to grant-fund voluntary organisations that provide advice and assistance. Broad-ranging provision has been made and more than adequate powers have been put in place to ensure that that will continue. We are committed to that.

<P>

<a name="20715-11_para11"></a>I shall discuss the amendments in reverse order. The case against Amendment No. 145 is clear. As we do not believe that legal representation at an appeal is necessary, it would be nonsense for the Home Office to pay the travel expenses of an asylum seeker seeking legal advice in connection with an appeal against the withdrawal of support.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020715/text/20715-12.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Will the Minister say why he thinks that legal representation in an appeal is not necessary?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am talking about the specific circumstances relating to withdrawal of support. I am happy to tell the Committee why Amendment No. 144 is unnecessary. Section 96(1)(c) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 may allow us to meet the expenses of witnesses who attend an asylum appeal in respect of a supported asylum seeker. Section 103(9) of the same Act, which is reproduced in the new Section 103B inserted by Clause 41 of the Bill, may allow the expenses of a witness attending an asylum support hearing to be paid, and Section 96(2) allows for forms of support other than those specified by Section 96(1) to be provided in exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para0"></a>Amendment No. 144 is an attempt to require travel expenses of witnesses to be paid in every case. Current legislation is permissive, but it is normal policy to meet the travel expenses of witnesses, so I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that making payment mandatory is not necessary. There may be circumstances in which it would be ridiculous to pay travelling expenses&#151;for example when a witness is more than able to afford the costs of travel. NASS currently operates under instructions to that effect.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para1"></a>Amendment No. 143A would affect the current legislation that the Secretary of State may pay any reasonable travelling expenses to enable an appellant to attend an appeal hearing in connection with a decision to refuse or terminate support. I am happy to reassure the Committee that, as a general rule, reasonable travel expenses of appellants will be met from public funds. But again it would be nonsensical to insist on that in every case. Support may be terminated early because the person has failed to abide by the terms in which that support was offered. The person may have been working without telling the authorities and claiming support at the same time. We have to be able to take account of those circumstances. People have undoubtedly defrauded the public purse and many will be well able to meet the costs of their own travel.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para2"></a>We must ensure that public money used for supporting asylum seekers is spent to best effect. Paying travel expenses in every case, even for those who can afford the costs of their own travel, would not represent best value for money. It would be entirely inappropriate to meet the costs of travel in such cases. For that reason the amendment should be withdrawn as the points that it covers have already been met by and large.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   The Minister cited Clause 97 of the Bill which does indeed deal with grants. However, they are <P>


<a name="column_1011"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1011</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>limited to persons who have a right of appeal. Therefore, the clause does not go wide enough to cover legal advice before a first decision has been made. Will the Minister consider having a dialogue with the Legal Services Commission so that legal advice will be readily available to those who need it at the earliest possible stage? That would lead to much better quality first decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am happy to consider that point. The noble Lord is right about what Clause 96 covers. The Secretary of State can make grants to voluntary organisations that provide advice or assistance to people with a right of appeal under Part 5 of the Bill. The circumstances to which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred are limited to that element of the legislation. I shall consider that point, but we are probably right in constraining the area which it covers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. He has convinced me that he may do what I ask, and I very much hope that he will. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<a name="20715-12_para7"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 48 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   This is an extremely important clause, although it is short. It refers to Schedule 3 which is a long, complex and important schedule setting out entirely new legislation for the withholding and withdrawal of support. It refers to four categories of people: failed asylum seekers; people living here illegally; European Union and EEA citizens; and those who have been granted refugee status in another EU state.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para8"></a>These new proposals were introduced at the last minute in another place. They received what can only be described as a cursory discussion on Report, together with a large number of other amendments. They certainly did not receive proper scrutiny. If they are to receive proper scrutiny, this is the only time and place that it will happen. Therefore, I hope that Members of the Committee will bear with me.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para9"></a>The Government's reason for bringing forward the amendment was clearly to deal with what is commonly called "benefit shopping". People in various categories, particularly refugees and former refugees who have gained citizenship in another part of Europe, come to this country and are not economically active; not having lived here for any length of time, they are unable to claim habitual residence. Because they are not able to claim national benefits, they fall back on claiming what might be termed local benefits: essentially benefits from social services departments as set out in paragraph 1 of the schedule. So there is clearly a problem in some places. It was reported to me that in Birmingham, for example, this has cost the <P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>social services department £3 million&#151;a not inconsiderable sum. It is a problem that must be examined and sorted out.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para10"></a>The difficulty is this. By bringing forward this legislation at the last minute in the other place, in what seems to be a fairly rushed and not very considered way, the Government are not merely tackling the problem of a relatively small number of people&#151;for some reason most appear to be Somalis, but the provision no doubt applies to others&#151;they are introducing legislation which appears to have a far more wide-ranging effect and which applies to all citizens of the EU and the EEA.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para11"></a>I do not understand European law in this area, or indeed in any other area, and I doubt whether many other people do. It is extremely complex. The amendment itself is a complex attempt to amend an extremely complex area of law on a one-off basis, in a Bill which otherwise has nothing to do with European legislation and rules, and which may well extend into areas beyond the competence&#151;I use the word in a colloquial way&#151;of those who are dealing with these matters.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para12"></a>It is suggested by some that this proposed piece of legislation may well break European rules&#151;that it may be contrary to European law. I do not know whether that is the case, but there are enough people who appear to know what they are talking about who are putting that forward to cause concern.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para13"></a>It seems to us that any solution to the problem requires a European-wide agreement. Not to seek such agreement risks breaking a fundamental principle of equality of treatment for all EEA citizens. EEA citizens who come to this country and are able to work are all right. If they live here long enough, they may well meet the habitual residence test if in the future they are in need of assistance, for example, in regard to a disability or whatever it may be. But those who are not able to work here are being potentially discriminated against.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para14"></a>The proposal is to remove a raft of possible benefits from four different categories. It seems to me that no one can argue against the removal of benefits from failed asylum seekers. If their claim had failed, they are not entitled to support beyond that which may be necessary on humanitarian grounds and perhaps to look after any children.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para15"></a>However, the proposal gives rise to various concerns. There are at present an unknown number of people in this country who are in receipt of welfare support, housing support, and social services support of other kinds from local authorities. I do not know whether the Minister can give the government estimate of the numbers involved. I have not seen the figure, but it is clearly a reasonably large minority in a few places, and not many in the rest of the country.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para16"></a>These are potentially families who rely on the benefits that they receive. It may involve older people and children. One of the concerns is: what happens to these people? If the legislation is passed, will their benefit simply be cut off; and what would the consequences be? If the Government intend in the <P>


<a name="column_1013"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>future to provide support only for children, does that mean that those children will be taken into care and that families will be split up? What are the alternatives?
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para17"></a>A further concern is that this provision could prevent families being reunited if there are family members with refugee status in different countries. If a husband has refugee status in France, for example, and the wife and children have refugee status here, on the face of it this schedule would prevent the husband coming to this country and being reunited with his children. Is that sensible? Should not this issue be dealt with at European level, so that refugee status can be transferred by agreement from one country to another?
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para18"></a>Paragraph 14 of the schedule places on local authorities a duty to provide information if they come across people whom they believe to be failed asylum seekers or who are otherwise not entitled to be living here&#151;who are settled here unlawfully. It places on the local authority a duty to notify the central authorities of that fact.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para19"></a>The wording of paragraph 14 is rather strange and the provision is unclear. It does not state quite so boldly that there is a general duty on local authorities. It suggests that the duty is in relation to their other duties as regards people's eligibility for social services support. The question arises: is this to be regarded in future as a general duty on local authorities? If they come across someone who is not entitled to be living here, is it their duty in all cases to notify the Government, or only where an application is being made for support and the applicants are found to be ineligible under the terms of the schedule?
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para20"></a>If it is a general duty, it will place many local authorities in great difficulty. Anyone involved with refugees and asylum seekers hears many stories. Sometimes you deliberately close your ears to them. You get to know that such and such a person has failed in his or her asylum claim after going through all the appeal processes, and is said to be living in such and such a place with such and such a person. You close your eyes to that. If you are working with asylum and refugee groups and you go around "shopping" people, you immediately lose credibility. You cannot do that. That is the case with some local authority employees who are employed specifically to work with such groups. If it is to be their duty to "shop" people whenever they come across rumours or even strong evidence that people are living in this country when they should not be, it will make their job impossible. It will cut local authorities off from the very useful contacts that they have with local asylum and refugee groups. The point needs clarification.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para21"></a>Amendment No. 158A in this group refers to paragraph 15 of Schedule 3, which allows the Secretary of State to invent a new class of person for this purpose. As I understand it, this is over and above the four existing classes&#151;failed asylum seekers, EEA citizens and so on. A new class of person can be invented and can simply be added to the list by order. This seems an extraordinary provision&#151;the ability to <P>


<a name="column_1014"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1014</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remove people's rights and to create new "non-persons" simply by order. I wonder whether the Minister can justify this provision.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para22"></a>Will the Minister define a failed asylum seeker? Is it someone who has been turned down at the first stage; or has someone to go through the whole process before the provisions can be brought in? Will the Minister tell us what reliance on a right under or by virtue of Community treaties means? I do not understand it. I can find no one who can explain it to me in words of one syllable. Perhaps the Minister can do so. Such a provision could drive a coach and horses through the schedule; or it may clarify it.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para23"></a>How many people are getting this support from local authorities at present? By what process will they lose support? In other words, what transitional period will there be for people in that position at present or will they simply be thrown out on the street without further ado? What is the relationship of the habitual residence test to the proposed new legislation? It was discussed, although not clarified, in another place.
<P>

<a name="20715-12_para24"></a>It is an extremely important schedule which deserves considerable discussion and understanding before the Committee allows it to go through.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Schedule 3 is four-and-a-half pages long. It is rather complicated and its legal effect is, in several places, somewhat obscure. I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;he has taken a lot of trouble in putting forward his views on the schedule&#151;that we can do without it.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para0"></a>Perhaps I may run quickly through some of the provisions. Paragraph 1 relates to ineligibility for support. That merely ensures that existing law of various kinds must not be ignored. We could not do without that. I have slight doubts about the exceptions which are put forward but they do not go too far and I think that that provision is all right.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para1"></a>The four classes of ineligible persons are set out in paragraphs 4 to 7. I think that those are wise provisions which we must have. Paragraph 8 provides that,

<a name="20715-13_para2"></a>That is necessary and fair. I agree with the power given to the Secretary of State under paragraph 10 to make regulations providing for accommodation. That is fair enough. The same applies to paragraph 11; that is fair enough.

<a name="20715-13_para3"></a>The offences follow naturally if there are breaches. It is only right that the schedule should be supported by the power to prosecute if necessary although, frankly, the circumstances in which prosecutions are likely to take place would, I think, turn out to be rather narrow. Paragraph 14 relates to information and is fair enough.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para4"></a>I now invite the Committee's attention to paragraph 15 which relates to power to amend the schedule. That is what we call a Henry VIII clause giving the Secretary of State power to amend primary legislation made by Parliament. We should try to avoid that wherever <P>


<a name="column_1015"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1015</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible. Bearing in mind the trouble which has been taken with regard to the other parts of Schedule 3, I doubt whether that Henry VIII clause is necessary or desirable. Paragraph 16 relates to the making of regulations. We then have a paragraph relating to interpretation which is clear enough.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para5"></a>Although I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and his noble friends that Schedule 3 should be struck from the Bill, the Government should consider the making of the Henry VIII clause. I support the Government on the remainder of the schedule.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, probably rightly says that the House of Commons did not look hard at the schedule; it came in at the last moment. I accept that. He asked what a failed asylum seeker is. I should have thought we knew that by now: an asylum seeker who has failed the test and failed on appeal. I may be wrong, but the noble Lord asked the question and that seemed to be the answer. The Government will or will not confirm my opinion.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para6"></a>The noble Lord also asked what happens if someone has to leave. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the schedule provide that the Secretary of State may make regulations to enable that person to leave. That is clearly important. Although we want asylum seekers who deserve to stay to do so, we want the whole matter dealt with quickly. We do not want people staying after they have been refused, so the Secretary of State may by regulations provide for them to go. If a person has a dependent child, under paragraph 9 he can obtain accommodation before that arrangement is made.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para7"></a> I considered the schedule and the Explanatory Notes with some care. I thought that I understood the schedule and that it was fairly satisfactory. I listened carefully to the noble Lord. He may have unearthed something that will worry me although I am not sure that he did. I do not know whether it is my job to encourage the Government in this way, but on those questions I had thought that I understood the schedule.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para8"></a>I am not sure whether the measure to which my noble friend Lord Renton objects is a Henry VIII clause. It enables the Secretary of State to alter the list of people to whom the provision applies and the list of legislation that does not apply. I thought that that was a safety net. Again, I should like to hear what the Government have to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I support the concern expressed by my noble friend Lord Greaves, and the noble Lord, Lord Renton. Apart from the serious implication about the Henry VIII clause in relation to power to amend the schedule, what new powers will define the type of person to be included? Will such regulations be brought before the House by statutory instrument? That will give the opportunity for both Houses of Parliament to consider them. Alternatively, is it simply <P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   As I understand it, Clause 48 and Schedule 3 remove all powers for local authorities to provide support or assistance to four categories of ineligible person. Schedule 2 of the Local Government Act 2000 allows a very wide discretion for local authorities to act as they see fit to promote well-being in their particular areas.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para9"></a>I&#151;and, I suspect, many other Members of the Committee&#151;have received a substantial note from the Local Government Association strongly opposing this clause. The note seems to contain three central objections. First, the association objects, in principle, to what it sees as an unnecessary fettering of local authority powers under Section 2 of the Local Government Act. Secondly, it appears to believe that local authorities should retain the right, at their discretion, in relation to those categories of ineligible person, to provide support. Thirdly, the LGA strongly objects to a lack of consultation with local authorities before the provisions were included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para10"></a>On that last point, I understand that the clause was introduced during the proceedings in another place and that, contrary to the traditions that are enshrined in the system of protocols which lay down the relationship between central and local government, no prior consultation was undertaken. That is what I glean from the LGA's note. I, like other Members of the Committee, am anxious to hear from the Minister; in particular, I look forward to his reaction to the point on consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I was most impressed by my noble friend's remarks. He raised a matter to which I had not attributed much importance. Clearly, paragraph 14 on page 87 is the provision that mainly concerns local authorities. Some of the minor provisions in that regard could also affect local authorities. Will the Minister explain what other provisions in the schedule, apart from paragraph 14, would worry local authorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   This is my first time at the Dispatch Box this afternoon. With the leave of the Committee, I should like to make a short statement relating to our debates on Tuesday, 9th July. When I have done that, I shall turn to Clause 48.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para11"></a> On Tuesday, 9th July at col. 602 I gave figures from memory concerning the success rate of asylum applicants. The figures that I gave related to initial decisions only; that was the issue in contention. I apologise for inadvertently misleading the Committee.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para12"></a>For the record, I point out that for 2001, 9 per cent of applicants were granted asylum and 17 per cent were granted exceptional leave to remain at the initial decision stage. We will shortly be publishing an estimated figure for 2001, including the figures for <P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appeals in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin on asylum statistics for 2001. That will contain the latest figures. We have, however, considered the applications made in 2000 under normal procedures and have examined the outcomes. At the initial decision stage, 11 per cent were recognised as refugees, 12 per cent were granted ELR and the remainder were refused. Of all those who were refused at the initial stage, we estimated that a further 8 per cent were successful after appeal to an adjudicator as either refugees or in being granted ELR; we do not currently have the split between the two. We also do not have comparable figures for those who are&#151;or were&#151;successful after appeal to the IAT or higher courts, but a very small proportion is involved. Our overall best estimate for 2000 is that 31 per cent of those who applied for asylum in that year were successful in being recognised as refugees or in being granted ELR. That figure of 31 per cent does not represent the number of those who were recognised as refugees; the two figures would be added together. I hope that before long we will be able to disaggregate the two figures, which will give us a better picture of the situation.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para13"></a>I hope that that is helpful. I repeat the undertaking that I gave to place a short explanatory paper in the Library before the Bill's Report stage.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para14"></a>I turn to Clause 48. The provision restricts the type of support that is available to those who have citizenship or refugee status in other EU/EEA states who are coming to the UK and claiming benefits. At the same time, it restricts support that is available to other categories of individuals; that is, failed asylum seekers who can leave the UK but do not co-operate with removal directions, and individuals who reside in the UK illegally but who have not applied for asylum. That has been introduced at least in part to help local authorities by providing legal clarity when dealing with applications for support from those categories of individuals.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para15"></a>At the moment, different local authorities are adopting different approaches to claims for support from those individuals. Local authorities are being approached for social services support, normally under the National Assistance Act 1948 or, in the case of those with children, the Children Act 1989, as individuals fail the income-related benefits test.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para16"></a>There certainly are increasing numbers of individuals arriving in the UK and seeking social services assistance in those respects. That is placing a considerable demand on local authorities' resources and causes considerable problems for some of them. We do not know&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked about this&#151;the precise numbers with which we are faced. That indicates the problem being faced by the statutory agencies that are trying to cope with that influx. I shall give examples later of areas in which we know that there is a problem. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that in Leicester alone between 2,000 and 10,000 people of Somali origin have migrated over the past 18 months or so. Although Dutch nationals of Somali origin highlight the problem, there are also reports of growing communities from other areas, such as Portugal and Montserrat. We are therefore <P>


<a name="column_1018"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1018</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>introducing these measures to help to ease the pressures that are being brought to bear on local authorities and at the same time to provide those individuals and their families with the means to return to their home country.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para17"></a> Two recent cases in the courts have assisted in that area. The case of G v Barnet involved a Dutch national of Somali origin who asked for local authority accommodation to be provided for her to live with her child. Following a needs assessment, the local authority offered the means for them both to return home to Holland, where support was available to them, alongside an offer to take the child into care. The Court of Appeal held that that was a reasonable offer on the part of the local authority and that the authority was not obliged to house the family if they rejected the offer, although it would be obliged to accommodate the child, and was quite willing to do so.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para18"></a>This year, the cases of Ali and Mohammed v Birmingham involved similar circumstances. Following the Barnet judgment, the council exercised its new policy and carried out needs assessments in each case, which resulted in its offering transport to the families to return to the Netherlands, where they had welfare rights, with an offer to accommodate the children if the travel were declined. In those cases, the offers were not accepted and the case went to judicial review. The court held that, once again, that approach was lawful.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked for further evidence about whether there is a problem. I shall illustrate that briefly. Birmingham City Council brought to our attention the situation that it faced in 2000, when it received applications for support from more than 265 families. In July 2000, the council was supporting more than 200 families. As a consequence, in the financial year 2000-01, supporting those families cost £2.8 million in social services provision. In the following year, after it had tightened its policy, the cost to Birmingham City Council was £1.7 million. I recollect, as will other Members of the Committee, that Birmingham City Council approached the Department of Health towards the end of last year because of the extreme overspend on its social services budget in that year and was desperately seeking additional financial support. Clearly, those additional burdens cannot have helped it in any respect.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para20"></a>We have also been told that, in the last 18 months to July 2002, some 1,100 Somali children have arrived in Leicester, to be educated in Leicester schools, mostly at primary level. We have also had representations from the city of Sheffield as to the extent of their exposure to this problem, and seeking Government support to rectify it.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para21"></a>In some cases local authorities have essentially sought government support to put beyond doubt or risk the legal position, so that they are not constantly at the risk of challenge. In other cases, perhaps more like Leicester or Sheffield, they have asked whether central government would bail them out in relation to the costs to which they are exposed by exercising the discretion to pay out to families in this way. There is <P>


<a name="column_1019"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1019</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undoubtedly a problem, certainly in the local authorities I have mentioned&#151;Barnet, Birmingham, Leicester and Sheffield&#151;but there is anecdotal evidence that it goes wider than that, although the department has not undertaken a systematic trawl of it.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para22"></a>I should also mention that Leicester's chief executive has indicated to officials in the department that, to cover the £3 million additional costs they have incurred through the exercise of their discretion in this matter, it would require a council tax increase of over 5 per cent in the current year 2002&#150;03 if they have to fund it locally&#151;as they will clearly have to.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para23"></a>There is a problem, therefore, and it is quite a substantial and serious one for a number of local authorities. It is why, in part, the Government have responded to these representations and sought to clarify the position for the local authorities concerned.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para24"></a>Turning back to some of the specifics of the schedule, for those who have citizenship or refugee status in another EU or EEA state short-term accommodation may be provided to families with children, as well as a one-way journey to their home country. If the family do not take up the offer of travel or fail to travel, all support will be cut off, other than an offer of support for the children under the Children Act 1989. For asylum seekers whose claim has been rejected and who could leave the UK but who fail to comply with the removal directions, all support will also come to an end. Local authorities will only be able to provide an offer of support to children under the Children Act 1989. Also, for those who are in the UK unlawfully and who apply to the local authority for support, including failed asylum seekers, the local authorities would be required to inform the Home Office so that removal can be arranged.
<P>

<a name="20715-13_para25"></a>The local authority may provide short-term accommodation to families with children until the date of removal. Should the family fail to travel, all support will be terminated other than an offer of support for the children under the Children Act 1989.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I wonder whether the Minister can help me? I have a case at the moment which has not come before the authorities, where a family was resident in France. The refugee status of the head of household was withdrawn and so he came to Great Britain and is now living here. Would he have support withdrawn, when there is evidence from the French authorities that they no longer recognise him as a refugee in their country?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Given my recent experiences, I am slightly hesitant to give off-the-cuff judgments on the law on eligibility. I will consider that, however, and if by the time I come to the end of my wind-up speech I am able to give a better answer, I will do so. Otherwise, I will write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para0"></a>We will ensure that children and other vulnerable persons continue to receive appropriate care, while at the same time enabling families to stay together by <P>


<a name="column_1020"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1020</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accepting the offer of a journey home. In particular, those with special care needs will continue to have them met until the date of travel. If they do not travel and they have not provided an acceptable excuse&#151;for example, that they were too ill to travel, with a supporting medical certificate&#151;then care will be reduced to the minimum level in order to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para1"></a>We will also need to guard against those who may seek to abuse the support and facilities offered to them. Local authority resources need to be preserved for those who are in genuine need. For example, I well recollect Birmingham City Council pointing out the serious knock-on effect of their exposure to costs in this respect on caring for the elderly and children in need in their area. For that reason we are introducing two new offences as part of this measure. First, it will be an offence for a person to accept the offer of short-term accommodation and/or a journey home and then to return to the UK and claim these benefits again. The Committee will see why.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para2"></a>Secondly, to help ensure that local authorities have the best information before them when considering a request for support under these provisions, it will be an offence for a person to fail to mention any previous request for support under these measures.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para3"></a>As has been mentioned, we are also placing an obligation upon local authorities to report to the Secretary of State if the prohibition on granting types of support listed in this amendment apply to failed asylum seekers or to persons unlawfully in the UK in the authority's area. This will facilitate the Home Office instigating removal action against appropriate individuals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I apologise for disturbing the flow of the Minister's speech, but what sanctions are available to the Government if the local authority do not co-operate in terms of informing either the failed asylum seekers, or for that matter a person illegally settled in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Let me add that to the list of issues to which I will seek to respond when I conclude. I will touch more specifically on the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the duty to report to the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para4"></a> If a local authority has reasonable suspicion that a person is here unlawfully or a failed asylum seeker is in their area, they will be required to report it to IND, and I think that that is right. If people have no right of residence here, local authorities, as responsible public bodies, should co-operate with central government on their removal.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para5"></a>The exact nature of this provision and how it will operate will be laid out in regulations, drawn up in full consultation with the LGA. I will return to the LGA later.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para6"></a>Officials in the department, in consultation with colleagues from other government departments, will provide practical guidance and assistance to local authorities to assist them in undertaking this duty. <P>


<a name="column_1021"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1021</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Again, that guidance will be the subject of very full consultation and discussion with the LGA and any particular local authorities that wish to become actively involved in it.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para7"></a>The question was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, of the definition of a failed asylum seeker. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, gave the correct answer. A failed asylum seeker is somebody who has been through the appeal process, not someone with a first refusal. It is somebody who has either appealed and the appeal has been heard, or who has not chosen to exercise their appeal and is time-expired.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, also asked if this could breach legal Community treaties. That is not so. Paragraph 3(b) of the schedule provides that a person's Community rights cannot be affected. Community law rights will take primacy. Any right to support under Community law will be respected.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para9"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Dholakia, asked about paragraph 15 applying by order to a new class of person, which touches the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, as to whether paragraph 15 was a Henry VIII clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I must apologise. When I said that paragraph 15 was a Henry VIII clause I had overlooked the fact that in paragraph 16 any order that the Secretary of State makes must be made by statutory instrument, so Parliament will have the opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   As ever, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has pre-empted me. It will be subject to affirmative resolution and it is intended to give maximum flexibility in the future application of this provision. That is therefore why it will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It is in recognition of the likely complexities of the provision which operates in practice. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has signalled, it is an extremely complicated area of law and it may well be that there is a need to look at how it is fine-tuned in the future&#151;but by affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked about the relationship to habitual residence tests. If, for example, a local authority chose to support a family for six months under the National Assistance Act provisions, at the end of that time they would have met the habitual residence period and the burden for welfare support would fall to national government. While we recognise that, in an ideal world, we would not wish to fetter a local authority's discretion, we firmly believe that it is right to do so because the consequences bear on health authorities and central government.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised some significant questions about the unnecessary fettering of local authority discretion. That was the first question raised by the LGA. I have made it clear that a number of local authorities considered that the Government needed to act on this. The largest local <P>


<a name="column_1022"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1022</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority in the land and a number of others with considerable experience have said that this needs to be addressed as a serious issue. We have sought to respond to that.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para12"></a>Our concern is that if we just extinguished the right under the National Assistance Act and the Children Act, a local authority that was keen on pursuing such a policy might be able to say that Section 2 of the Local Government Act gave it the power. Therefore, with reluctance, we have had to make it explicit that that is not an option; otherwise we would not have closed the loophole. We think that it is necessary to put the issue beyond doubt and to limit the discretion of local authorities in this way.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para13"></a>On the LGA's third point, the best I can say is that I do not think that we are particularly proud of the attempts that have been made at consultation on the principle of this so far. I hope that noble Lords will not press me further than that. There have been busy telephone conversations recently and discussions with the chairman of the LGA, who recognises that it is important that discussions between officials continue on the principle as well on as the implementation detail.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para14"></a>There are already dates for meetings to discuss the implementation detail, but despite there having been an attempt&#151;albeit a rather weak one&#151;to have consultation about the principle, it is fair and true to say that the LGA has not been invited to a discussion about the principle. We are not eager to have our minds easily changed on the subject, but it is part of the proper process that the LGA should be given an opportunity to do so and that we should consider its representations. I told officials last Thursday or Friday that if the LGA can show that it is not necessary to act against the Local Government Act in the way we suggest, our minds will be open to consider the argument, but I find it difficult to see how the LGA's power runs to give an assurance that a local authority might not use that if we did not extinguish it.
<P>

<a name="20715-14_para15"></a>I hope that that mea culpa, in a sense, signals that we are intent on engaging the LGA in the implementation detail and on the principle, even at this stage of the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way and for his frank description of what happened with respect to consultation. The obvious concern, not just from these Benches, but from around your Lordships' House, is: what price constitutional devolution, which depends so much on the concordat and protocol system? Because the Minister has been so frank, I am not accusing him of being engaged in something wrongful. I am simply hoping that, in future, greater respect will be paid to the concordat system. It is fundamental to the Government's constitutional philosophy, as I understand it, that decisions should be taken at the lowest level possible and that the process should be controlled not by law, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>but by a system of conventional agreements between local authorities and central government. I hope that the breach on this occasion will prove a rare one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   On the same point, I notice that most of the Acts that local government will not be able to operate under if the provision becomes law relate to functions that are devolved to the Scots Parliament. Has the Scots Parliament agreed? Was it not consulted as well as local authorities? It astonishes me that the Government could go far on this without consulting local government. I had not heard from the local authorities, which is why I did not mention those points; but now that the situation has become clear to me, I am surprised. What about the Scots Parliament?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   There is not much else that I should add to what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, apart from recognising that the Government value their relationship with local government. We believe in subsidiarity as far as is reasonably practicable in terms of national objectives. Anything that fundamentally might be seen to affect the powers and responsibilities of local government should be discussed and consulted on at the earliest appropriate stage. I do not wish to dig my hole any deeper at this point.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para0"></a>I am pleased to report that officials visited Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to discuss these issues, recognising, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, that, while immigration is a national matter, the application of this clearly affects the role of local government in those areas. I am informed that they have been appropriately consulted.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para1"></a>There are a few remaining points to which I have not responded. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked a very challenging question about whether the schedule applies to a French family that does not have a record of refugee status in France. It does not, although we cannot comment on particular cases. Paragraph 4 will apply only to persons with refugee status in another EU state, such as France. On these facts, we do not believe that the paragraph would apply, because the person concerned does not have refugee status in France.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked what sanctions were available. Guidance will be statutory under paragraph 14 and local authorities must follow it. If they do not, they are in breach of their statutory obligation to follow the guidance. It is clearly a fundamental obligation on them.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para3"></a>I do not want to detain the Committee further. Officials will provide practical guidance and assistance to local authorities on the implementation. We are satisfied that the measures comply with ECHR requirements and other international obligations. Those with refugee status in an EU state or nationals of such a state have entitlement to support elsewhere, so claiming support here is not an acceptable use of public money and presents a considerable burden on local authorities and their social services budgets, as well as on the national state. We have to make it clear that local authorities will not be empowered to provide <P>

<A NAME="20715-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   The more I listened to the Minister, particularly once he got beyond repeating word for word what had been said in the Commons, the more interesting it got. His comments have confirmed that this is an extremely complex area, some of which does not belong in the Bill, and that he does not know the answers to some of the complexities that have been raised. I do not blame him for that. I am now even more convinced that the combination of the content of the schedule and the way in which it was introduced so late in another place make it another example of rushed, knee-jerk legislation, brought forward because the Bill presented an opportunity to deal with people taking advantage of local authority powers, which none of us denies is clearly a problem in a small number of places.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para4"></a>I am still extremely unhappy about two broad areas. There may be more, but I am unhappy in particular about two. The first is the question of the relationship between this schedule and European law. So far as concerns failed asylum seekers and refugees in other European countries, I do not have a fundamental issue of principle. But the schedule would remove some of the rights and entitlements of citizens of EU and EEA countries who are in this country. I believe that this complex area is likely to lead to judicial challenge and judicial review and that it will end up in the European Court of Justice. The issue should be thought through far more carefully and discussed with our partners in Europe. If legislation is required, it should be the subject of separate legislation.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para5"></a>The Minister said that rights under the Community treaties will be respected. That is all well and good, but he has not been able to tell me what those rights are and how they interact with what is being proposed in the schedule. I consider that to be extremely unsatisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for giving way. I believed that I had covered most of the issues. I tried to give the clearest example why this is an urgent and important issue which has been brought to our attention by a number of local authorities. If any matters remain unaddressed, I shall write to the noble Lord before Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I understand the wish of the Minister and of the Government to react quickly to this matter. However, reacting quickly is no substitute for reacting in a way that will produce sensible legislation that will stick.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para6"></a>The second area about which I am utterly alarmed by what the Minister said is the requirement for local authorities to report people if it appears to a local authority that paragraph 1 applies or may apply. The <P>


<a name="column_1025"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1025</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister referred to "reasonable suspicion". That could be disastrous for local community relations, particularly where people are working hard to receive and look after asylum seekers who have been dispersed to their areas.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para7"></a>It is a simple fact that those who report on people who remain after their asylum claims have failed will immediately lose any confidence that exists among the communities of asylum seekers and among those who work with them locally. That is a fact of life. Perhaps the Minister will find out what happens in practice.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para8"></a>It is not only people such as myself who sometimes turn a deaf ear and a blind eye in the interests of developing good relationships in working with asylum seekers; the same applies to employees of local authorities, central government and local police forces. Police officers involved with asylum seekers in two different regions have told me that the one thing with which they do not wish to become involved under any circumstances is removals. If that were to happen, the confidence built up and the contacts established with asylum seeker communities would be lost. They would be shunned and kept out. That is true of everyone who deals with asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para9"></a>Agencies, such as the Immigration Service, have responsibility for removals. But placing a duty on local authorities&#151;the provision will relate not only to social services but to district and parish councils&#151;to report people about whom they have "reasonable suspicion" is a recipe for disaster. I am not talking here about principles and what should happen in an ideal world; I am talking about what happens on the ground. I believe that the Government should think again.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para10"></a> Having said that, I believe that over the next few weeks many of us will try to get our minds around this schedule even further. In the meantime, I shall not press my opposition to the Question that the clause stand part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>   moved Amendment No. 146:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 48, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-15_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ADVICE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE
<br>
(1) The Social Security Advisory Committee shall&#151;
<br>
(a) give advice and assistance to the Secretary of State in connection with the discharge of his functions under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and Parts 2 and 3 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, and
<br>
(b) to perform such other duties as may be assigned to the Committee under any enactment.
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State shall refer to the Committee for consideration and advice any questions relating to the operation of the said enactments as are causing public concern."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-15_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment. I appreciate that the Minister may say that it is technically defective. I know that, but I dare say that his briefing notes tell him to say it.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para14"></a>However, there is a point of principle at issue. It is surely desirable that independent scrutiny of the effects on asylum seekers of present levels of support <P>


<a name="column_1026"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1026</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should take place, even if it is intended that those levels of support should be only short term. That is the proposition. Whether it should be carried out by the Social Security Advisory Committee or by some other body similarly charged is not important for the purposes of exploring the principle of this matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para15"></a>Why is the issue important? I believe that many Members of the Committee will have received from Oxfam and the Refugee Council a report entitled, Poverty and Asylum in the UK. It is based on a study, carried out on behalf of those bodies, of 40 organisations working with asylum seekers in England and Scotland. The findings suggest that 85 per cent of the organisations reported that their clients experience hunger; 95 per cent reported that their clients cannot afford to buy clothes or shoes; and 80 per cent reported that their clients are not able to maintain good health. Of course, that does not mean that all their clients are in that position. But it suggests that there is at least some cause for concern, even if the figures give a somewhat high level of response to certain questions.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para16"></a> Perhaps I may be specific. First, under the intended procedures, asylum seekers cannot benefit from any uprating that might apply to other social security benefits. Secondly, their entitlements do not give them a passport to other benefits. For example, it has been estimated that asylum seeker families may receive a 24 per cent lower level of support than other families on income support and associated benefits. Of course, in the case of disability, there is also no passported entitlement to this benefit.
<P>

<a name="20715-15_para17"></a>With regard to single asylum seekers, the general proposition is that they receive only 70 per cent of the IS rates. I accept that NASS will also provide electricity and heating, and therefore there is some compensating benefit for the difference between the 70 and 100 per cent rates. Nevertheless, I believe that sufficient reason exists to be concerned about the position of asylum seekers. Even if they are here for only a short period of time and will not achieve refugee status or ELR, surely they are entitled to maintain their standard of living at a tolerable level. No one says that they should be given luxury and no one suggests that the benefits should be lavish. They would not be, even if they were receiving IS. However, the proposition is simply that there should be an independent scrutiny and assessment of the levels of support which asylum seekers receive&#151;no more and no less. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I support Amendment No. 146, to which I have added my name. I certainly would not dream of trying to repeat the arguments put so ably by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. He made his case very forcefully. This is a matter of principle. It is a probing amendment. The noble Lord offered a very practical solution to the issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para0"></a>I declare a past and unpaid interest as a member of the SSAC over several years prior to becoming a Member of this House. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is right to point out the advantages to the Secretary of State, to Parliament and to those who seek <P>


<a name="column_1027"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1027</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>asylum of bringing into the loop on these matters SSAC, or, indeed, another organisation such as SSAC which could provide the type of scrutiny required.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para1"></a>The SSAC has the expertise required to give good advice to the Secretary of State. Indeed, only last week in your Lordships' House we were able to listen to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, paying tribute to the SSAC and its work, saying that it performed a valuable scrutiny role. So I am aware that Ministers see it as valuable.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para2"></a>I hope that the Minister is able to give careful consideration to the principle behind the amendment. And while I am on my feet perhaps I can refer back briefly to what the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said. I am grateful to him for putting on record tonight the figures with regard to determination of other matters, trying to put more clearly the answers he tried to give on Tuesday, 9th July at col. 602 of Hansard when we were debating Amendment No. 98, which I moved. I am grateful to him for putting those matters on record as soon as was reasonably practicable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I apologise to the Minister for not thanking him when I was last on my feet for the revised figures he has now produced. We are grateful for that. Issues still arise which we will want to discuss, but at least now we have the figures.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para3"></a>We on these Benches support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. As I spoke earlier and do not want to repeat what the noble Lord said, I shall say no more.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   I declare an interest as a member of the Oxfam Association. In congratulating and thanking my noble friend Lord Dubs for focusing attention on this matter, I hope he will forgive me for re-emphasising one basic point; that is, in our own social security provision we have an underlying principle that no people should be allowed to fall below certain standards. That is because they are people. Whatever the situation of asylum seekers, they are people. Therefore we need an independent assessment to ensure that whatever arrangements may have been made in good faith by the Government, they do not result in people falling below the standard which, in other respects, we say is the absolute minimum.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Dubs, with his wealth of experience in this field, for bringing forward this amendment. It stimulated an interesting and useful debate. However, I must say at the outset that the Government cannot accept the amendment, not only because it is technically deficient in one way or another, but also because of the way the NASS dispersal scheme has been set up.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para4"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves that the scheme was designed to be separate from the main benefits system and it is important that that distinction is maintained. Support provided to those with asylum seeker status is <P>


<a name="column_1028"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1028</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different and separate from that provided to other residents, notwithstanding the points made by Members of the Committee, most passionately by my noble friend Lord Judd. It is not intended to replicate the social security system but to provide a means of short-term support aimed at providing, as necessary, a roof over the head of destitute asylum seekers and the wherewithal to meet their essential living needs.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para5"></a>The SSAC does valuable work and may have an interest in the level of cash support that NASS provides to destitute asylum seekers. But that does not provide grounds for bringing the whole of NASS's work under its remit, which my noble friend seeks to do. Moreover, since under the present system the aim is to maintain NASS support rates at a particular level in relation to income support&#151;75 per cent of the adult rate and 100 per cent for children under 16&#151;it is not clear what role there would be for the SSAC in that area.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para6"></a>As to NASS's role in the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, that seems to be outside the normal scope of the SSAC's current activities and it is difficult to see that it would be appropriate to place a requirement on the Secretary of State to involve the SSAC in such matters, which certainly can give rise to public concern.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para7"></a>It is of course arguable that the SSAC would provide a useful consultative point for NASS, but NASS already has regular meetings with voluntary organisations who are well placed to provide specialised advice on support for asylum seekers&#151;organisations such as the Refugee Council and Migrant Helpline&#151;to discuss operational and other matters at both chief executive and working levels. In addition, regional consortia have been set up to discuss regional issues raised by the dispersal scheme and work is progressing towards the setting up of a national consultation forum to discuss national asylum support issues. Therefore we would be fearful that there would be replication.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para8"></a> Moreover the amendment would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to refer for consideration and advice any issue which was causing public concern. That would be extremely broad. Though we do not accept the need for the SSAC to have an asylum support remit, the committee is currently able to give advice on social security issues as it sees fit. I understand that the committee has frequent meetings with outside organisations and it maintains a close interest within its remit so such a duty would not be necessary.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para9"></a>I believe I inadvertently said earlier "75 per cent" level of support; I have been advised that it is 70 per cent. I want to clarify that error at the outset.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para10"></a>The SSAC already has a busy work programme to complete. It will not add significantly to the range of advice available to NASS. For those reasons I hope that my noble friend Lord Dubs, inspired as he was in tabling this interesting amendment, will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My noble friend has not filled me with great enthusiasm in his reply. But I was not surprised.

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1029</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para11"></a>I fully accept that the system for asylum seekers is separate from that of IS. I fully accept that it is short- term; indeed I said so when I moved the amendment. I also accept the Minister's point on the 70 per cent level. But the issue is really this. The 70 per cent figure is somewhat arbitrary. The Government have no objective evidence as to what the position is for people who are 30 per cent below that deemed the minimum for people on IS.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para12"></a>I had always assumed that income support was the lowest level at which people could maintain a tolerably decent living standard, albeit a low one. All we are saying is that asylum seekers should not be significantly below that. The only evidence that I have seen as to the effect of that is the study jointly sponsored by Oxfam and the Refugee Council, to which I referred.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para13"></a>My only plea in the amendment was that there should be an independent body, possibly the SSAC or possibly another body, which could look at this matter and report to government on it. I am sorry my noble friend feels unable to accept it. I shall read his speech with interest. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-16_para17"></a><P>

<a name="20715-16_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments may appear complex, but they are designed to ensure that this measure works correctly from the outset and that it is consistently applied. They have a variety of effects that I shall now set out.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para19"></a>To be most effective, the measures need regulation-making powers so that the Government can react quickly. There is a regulation-making power allowing the prohibition on providing support to be disapplied in certain cases and circumstances. That is now subject to affirmative resolution. The application of those measures also needs to be consistent. For that reason, any guidance issued by the Secretary of State to a local authority in relation to checking eligibility for support, and in relation to the duty to report those who fall within paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 3&#151;failed asylum seekers or persons in the UK unlawfully, and their dependants&#151;will have the effect of being statutory guidance. In other words, it must be followed by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para20"></a>Where, despite careful and meticulous application of guidance, an ineligible person still receives support or assistance of the various types listed in paragraph 1 of the schedule, there should be protection for local authorities from being found to have acted outside their powers.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para21"></a>Failed asylum seekers who have failed to comply with removal directions are excluded from support and assistance under paragraph 1 of Schedule 3. We are extending that provision to their dependants. That <P>


<a name="column_1030"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1030</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is consistent with the approach being taken under paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 3&#151;persons with refugee status abroad and citizens of other EEA states.
<P>

<a name="20715-16_para22"></a>We have also sought this opportunity to provide that a person with dual nationality, who is a British citizen, should continue to be able to be offered support and assistance in the current way. We are also ensuring that support may continue to be provided for persons who are asylum seekers until their claim for asylum is determined&#151;where their claim has been refused and their rights of appeal are exhausted. Finally, these amendments also add the equivalent Northern Ireland provisions into the various types of support in paragraph 1 of Schedule 3. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20715-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   As I have received advice from the Local Government Association, it is right that I should refer to that and ask the Minister a question based on it. The Minister will be aware that the LGA does not believe that these amendments represent an acceptable amelioration of the provisions. Its argument is that in principle it does not support the idea of binding guidance whereby Ministers can attempt to fine-tune their fettering of local authority discretion. The Minister will also be aware that the LGA has urged noble Lords to reject these amendments. Can the Minister tell the Committee what consultation the Government have had with the LGA in regard to these amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I do not have the benefit of having read closely the LGA submission. However, we have to listen carefully to points that it makes. I had assumed that these minor and technical amendments would be acceptable. I believe that they are useful in their extent, but clearly we are reminded of the importance and value of consultation. We would accept that the consultation on these points could have been better. It is perhaps the case that some of the minor and technical issues with which the amendments deal could have been better perfected. While consultation on the detail and on the implementation of the detail needs to be ongoing, we believe that the amendments are valuable. We shall continue our dialogue with the LGA so that we understand better the situation, and so that we are not at odds with the LGA on the way that the scheme will work.

In view of what has been said about earlier failures, does the Minister have any plans for consultation with local authorities in connection with the relevant guidance that is set out in Amendment No. 158?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   At all times our objective is to ensure that we confer properly with the Local Government Association. For someone like myself who once worked for it, I suppose it is extremely important that I make that plain. I have an inherent belief that at all times we should seek to consult local government in trying to get matters right. My noble friend Lord Filkin and myself have made it plain that it was felt that consultation on this and the earlier example was not of the best. We shall endeavour to put that right.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, raised the point about the guidance being available to Parliament. I do not believe that we shall be able to make the draft guidance available in advance. The regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so there will be an opportunity for your Lordships to be apprised of those and to have a full, proper and open debate. We shall ensure that the LGA is fully consulted on its representations and on the guidance itself.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para2"></a>I make a strong and important commitment to the Committee that, while accepting in this instance that some of the earlier consultation was not of the quality to which we would aspire in the future, I believe that these amendments are useful and valuable.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what they intend to do about the shortages in the number of people being trained in craft skills such as plumbing, electrical and gas fitting, despite the efforts of the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para32"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, a number of my colleagues have asked whether a bad plumbing experience stimulated me to ask for this debate. The answer is no. The debate was stimulated by a discussion with my very reliable plumber. He is approaching 60 and considering retirement but does not know who will take over his business. His son, who followed him into the profession, has set up his own business and has no reason to carry on his father's business. Over the past 15 years he has not taken on any apprentices. He had done so previously but had given up because it cost too much money and involved far too much paperwork. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Everybody I know is in the same boat. We are all of us between 55 and 65. We are all looking to retire. I don't know who's going to take over".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-17_para33"></a>I considered this an interesting issue. I have raised it with a number of other people, including the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, which provided me with a good deal of information. I have talked about the matter with further education college people.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para34"></a>I was interested because, in my studies as an economist, I have constantly been worried about the British economy's low level of productivity. Over the years I have associated that very much with Britain's education system and, in particular, with the lack of qualifications. At one point I was concerned about the low number of people undertaking degrees. I felt that Britain lagged behind other countries. Of course we have caught up rapidly.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para35"></a>It emerged strongly from the National Skills Taskforce work led by Chris Humphries, now director of City and Guilds Institute, that the major skill shortages in Britain are not at degree level, but at NVQ levels III and IV, which is the apprenticeship level. What is now called the advanced modern apprenticeship is a level II qualification, and HND and HNC are level IV qualifications, or foundation degree, which leads on to a degree level qualification. But the shortages are in those specific craft skills. The problem has, if anything, been exacerbated. In 1979 we trained in the region of 374,000 apprentices; we now train only about 200,000.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para36"></a>Two recent publications from Her Majesty's Government have helped me in my research, a publication entitled Government Supported Work Based Learning for Young People in England issued on 20th June and Participation in Education, Training and Employment by 16&#150;18 year olds, which appeared on 27th June.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para37"></a> Of approximately 2 million young people in the 16 to 18 year-old cohort, 75 per cent, or 1.5 million, are in education and training of some kind or another; 55 per <P>


<a name="column_1034"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1034</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cent are in full-time education; 8 per cent are in government-supported training; and only 5 per cent are in employer-supported training, described by Sir John Cassels, in his modern apprenticeship report, as the ideal form. Seven per cent are in other forms of education and training. That leaves roughly 25 per cent of the age group participating in no education or training at all. Interestingly enough, the statistic has not changed since 1991.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para38"></a>Of those 2 million young people, approximately 250,000 are in work-based education or training. Less than half&#151;only 119,000&#151;are pursuing the advanced modern apprenticeships, the level III qualification; 85,000 are pursuing the level II, which is the foundation modern apprenticeship; and 44,000 are engaged in other work-based training.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para39"></a>Therefore, it looks as though we are a considerable way off Cassels's target. In total, we have about 12 per cent&#151;250,000&#151;actually in work-based education and training. Cassels's target was that 25 per cent of the age cohort should be in work-based apprenticeships of one kind or another. We have only 12 per cent&#151;6 per cent of whom are in the advanced modern apprenticeships. Even if one includes the foundation modern apprenticeships, the figure is only 9 per cent. So we are a long way off the target.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para40"></a>If one delves further into the figures, of the 119,000 pursuing the level III qualifications only half&#151;49 per cent&#151;achieve the qualification. Approximately 30,000 young people complete the apprenticeships each year at level III. One must remember that this 119,000 is spread over the three years. That is 5 per cent of the age cohort. We double that if we include the level II qualification.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para41"></a>In the construction industry and some other areas the shortage problem is particularly great. The Employers Skill Survey, which backed up the National Skills Taskforce, reported:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Skill shortage vacancies for craft, sales and operatives are most likely to have serious impact on current performance [in the construction industry]. In particular, respondents indicated that around 53 per cent of skill-shortage vacancies for craft workers led to a loss of business.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-17_para42"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The construction sector was most likely to respond that it anticipated future recruitment problems . . . Around 50 per cent of establishments in the construction sector reported that they anticipated recruitment problems".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-17_para43"></a>So the construction industry is perhaps a particularly bad example.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para44"></a>I turn to the plumbing, electrical and gas-fitting industries. Roughly 15,500 young people are pursuing level II qualifications, but only 3,500 are pursuing level III qualifications. If one remembers that only 50 per cent achieve those qualifications and that the 3,500 is spread over three years, one is looking in the region of 600 a year achieving level III qualifications in these three broad areas. That is pitiful.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para45"></a>I have a number of questions. First, why are the Government putting so much emphasis on the 50 per cent participation rate in universities when it is clear that there are real and urgent skills gaps in the craft and skills area?
<P>


<a name="column_1035"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1035</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para46"></a>Secondly, what impact do the Government see the new educational maintenance allowances having? Are they not likely to encourage more young people to stay on at school in full-time education being pushed towards A-levels, the academic qualifications, rather than vocational qualifications? Is there not a danger that we shall still miss the buck on these academic qualifications?
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para47"></a>Thirdly, where is the incentive to undertake work-based learning? If one takes the engineering and manufacturing sector, the average cost of training an apprentice&#151;leaving aside the employer cost&#151;is between £13,000 and £16,000 a year. Yet the LSC is only paying £6,000 to £7,000 a year. The total cost of training an apprentice in this sector is almost £50,000 a year. Therefore, what is the incentive to the employer? One must add to that the bureaucracy, the sheer amount of paper to which my plumber referred.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para48"></a>Lastly, when will the Government recognise that there must be an incentive to pursue qualifications? There must be some mechanism to stop cowboys entering the industry. Although only 50 per cent achieve the advanced modern apprenticeships, there is a 100 per cent take-up in terms of employment. In other words, one can get employment whether or not one has the qualification.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para49"></a>Those in the industry are constantly undercut by cowboy operators. It costs a good deal to obtain high-level qualifications. It costs roughly £50,000 to train an apprentice. One then has ongoing costs in order to maintain that level of qualifications. I have a letter from a plumber in Norfolk who reckons that it costs him £3,500 every year just to maintain his qualifications. He cannot charge more than £15 an hour for his services because the cowboys come in and undercut him. Should we not be thinking in terms of operating not only on the supply side, in terms of training people, but also on the demand side, in terms of some form of registration? I put it to the Government that the minimum might be to ask trading standards officers to keep a register of those local traders&#151;plumbers, carpenters and so on&#151;who have the requisite qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para50"></a>The Consumers' Association and the CAB, receive the largest number of complaints about the cowboys, about the rogue traders. I, as a consumer, would really like to be able to telephone someone to ask if they could give me the name of someone with the requisite qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para51"></a>These are important issues. I hope that the Minister will have some answers to my questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   My Lords, I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers. I congratulate the noble Baroness on introducing this debate and on concentrating on apprenticeships. I looked at the book of Lamentations on the state of Israel in my Bible; it contains seven pages. I can trace the lamentations on the state of technical and vocational education in this country back at least to the Paris exhibition of 1867, at <P>


<a name="column_1036"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1036</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which we won only 10 per cent of the prizes. In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald said that development of technical education was the greatest need of this country. As the noble Baroness said, it still is.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para52"></a>About 20 reports on the subject were produced in the century up to 1969, and others subsequently, but apprenticeships, which were the core of technical skills training, reached their nadir during the 1970s and 1980s, when they practically disappeared. Despite their growth during the past four years, to which the Chancellor referred in his Statement this afternoon, the Cassels report says of apprenticeships that they are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"marginal to national life".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-17_para53"></a>Why? Because they have been "inconsistently delivered", "poorly managed" and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"poorly known about and understood".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-17_para54"></a>As the noble Baroness said, half of those who start out on the track do not finish it.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para55"></a>I congratulate the Government on having the wisdom to appoint John Cassels to chair the committee to make recommendations, which it did last September. He has much experience and good sense. As I understand it, the Government has had the equal sense to accept the substance of his recommendations. But I should like to offer a few thoughts on the matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para56"></a>The Cassels recommendations are based on three elements in the kit of a successful apprenticeship: first, the "can-do" skills in the national vocational qualification; secondly, what NVQs were long criticised for lacking, promoting the understanding of those skills through a technical certificate; and the key skills of English&#151;or communications, as the report calls it&#151;and of numeracy, so that apprentices can continue to update their skills.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para57"></a>That is excellent, but it is getting a touch complex. I urge the Government to ensure that those three important principles are articulated so that they cohere rather than are disjointed. In particular, I suggest that to motivate young people to master standards of literacy and numeracy, they should be integrated into the technical certificate, so that young people can see them in context as relevant to what they are doing, rather than being a boring, irrelevant add-on. So my first piece of advice is to articulate apprenticeships: simplify them and run two schemes into one.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para58"></a>My second piece of advice to government is: stay with it. The whole history of education is one of well-intentioned initiatives, followed by government saying, "Oh dear, we had better start again". In my experience of the field, it takes at least 10 years for employers to cotton on to the latest initiative. I repeat: stay with the Cassels initiative. I noticed that the Chancellor commits himself in his Statement only to the next couple of years and the expansion to 300,000. There is nothing about the vision as far as 2010 as in the Cassels report. We have a vision for higher education for 2010. What about skills education? Why not a commitment to that too?
<P>


<a name="column_1037"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1037</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para59"></a>My third piece of advice is: bear in mind that the learning and skills councils have only just been set up. The national training organisations are in the process of being replaced by new bodies&#151;sector skills associations. They are finding their way forward. With those two organisations finding their way forward, we need to involve employers. Unless the Government consider matters carefully with those new bodies, they will come a cropper and the intention to have a powerful launch will be met with loud and continuing complaints that we have muffed it.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para60"></a>My fourth point is: do not be too proud to pilot new ideas before launching them. Again, history shows that we need enthusiasm, commitment, resolution and action. A bit of piloting when what is being done is new, rather than a continuation, will pay dividends.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para61"></a>My next point is: we need strong promotion. One complaint of Cassels is that apprenticeships are poorly understood. As the noble Baroness said, only 5 or 6 per cent of apprenticeships take place on employers' premises. That shows how little they are known. We really must put money behind promotion and stay with it.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para62"></a> If I may say so, the stock in trade of this House is having been around a while and having a bit of experience. Perhaps officials would be well advised to spend half an hour reading the relevant chapter of Professor Alison Woolf's recent book, published last month, entitled, "Does Education Matter?"&#151;the chapter on vocational education. She makes it clear that if initiatives are government-led&#151;institution-led&#151;rather than employer-led, they will fail. We must ensure that line employers, rather than personnel departments, are in the lead. I remember the cost of employers not being in the lead with regard to NVQs.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para63"></a>It is said that any fool can learn from his own mistakes. Let us hope that the Government have the wisdom to learn from mine.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for raising this critical issue today. It is an area about which I know that she feels passionately and she made many interesting points. Doubtless the Minister has made a careful note of each and every one of them, and we shall hear his answers shortly. I shall not ask quite so many questions, but I, too, hope for an answer.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para64"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred most interestingly to the need for simple and basic qualifications. The first qualification is so often important. I think that I have previously told the story of when I was in a factory in Plymouth presenting NVQs to the workforce. Towards the end of the ceremony, a level 1 NVQ in warehouse keeping, I think it was, was announced. An old lady came forward&#151;I was told that she was 64. It was the first qualification that she had received in her life. She had tears streaming down her face as she stood in front of me. I must confess that I had tears too.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para65"></a>I shall make only a short intervention. As your Lordships may know, I am chairman of the Engineering and Marine Training Authority, which <P>


<a name="column_1038"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1038</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was until recently the national training organisation for the engineering manufacture sector. The Government are now replacing NTOs with sector skills councils and we hope that our bid to be the sector skills council for the technology, engineering and science sectors will soon be approved.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para66"></a>On previous occasions, I have ventured to bring to your Lordships' attention some of the difficulties that industry in general faces in addressing skills shortages. The responsibility for bridging the skills gap lies with both employers and government and they must work in partnership in addressing the need to raise skills levels in industry. Where employers devote resources to enhancing the skills base of their employees, in general, they are doing a good job. Small firms, in particular, have come to understand that their workforce is their most important resource and that investment in people is the key to their future business success.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para67"></a>For a sector such as engineering, which is already one of the most highly trained, it is still essential, especially in difficult times, that training is encouraged so that staff are prepared fully to exploit the future. But we need to do more to encourage employers, especially smaller firms, to engage in training staff. Initiatives such as "learndirect" go some way to address the problem faced especially by small and medium-sized enterprises in releasing key staff from the workforce, but there is also a need&#151;and here the onus is on the providers&#151;to deliver training in a manner that is more appropriate to employers.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para68"></a>I have previously drawn your Lordships' attention to the value of the modern apprenticeship framework and the significant impact that it has had on the number of people entering industry. Looking specifically at the engineering sector, the recruitment needs of the engineering industry require about 33,000 modern apprentices to be in training at any one time. In 1994, the number in training was about 8,000. Today it is 22,000, of which 18,000 are in England, 1,500 in Wales and perhaps 2,000 in Scotland. So while we have not reached the required number, we are moving in the right direction.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para69"></a>In making that point, I have referred to the variations in the funding of modern apprenticeship programmes recently been put into place by the Learning and Skills Council. A young person aged 16 to 18 attracts the full national rate for a modern apprenticeship. But for those employers who train people over the age of 19 years, the funding available is only 56 per cent of the national rate. It is not available at all for 25-plus year-olds, except in Wales; and it is people aged 19 and above who the industry is particularly keen to attract.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para70"></a> Of course, the engineering industry continues to take its concerns about these arrangements directly to the Learning and Skills Council, but I would urge the Government to press on the LSC the need for a rethink of this policy. Other very serious developments include the future funding arrangements for higher national diplomas, higher national certificates and NVQ level 4 qualifications. It is my understanding that financial <P>


<a name="column_1039"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1039</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>support from the Learning and Skills Council for those qualifications has been dropped. That will have serious consequences for attracting technicians into the industry, where there is a strong need to do so. I also believe that it will have an impact on increasing entry into higher education from modern apprenticeship programmes because the vast majority of higher education applications that come from technicians are from those with HNC, HND or NVQ level 4 qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para71"></a>I know that the Minister will realise that this need for progression from apprenticeship into higher education was a strong recommendation of last year's report by Sir John Cassels on the future of modern apprenticeships, to which the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred. I urge the Government to press the LSC to reconsider this decision.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-17_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Layard: </B>   My Lords, the debate could not be more timely. A shortage of non-graduate skills is staring us in the face. What is good is that we also have a Chancellor who, as he showed this afternoon, is willing to do something about it. The question is, what? What is the system we are trying to build? At present we have a system&#151;if it is a system at all&#151;that no one understands, bequeathed by the previous Conservative government. If one thinks of the people who really matter, none of them understands it. Children, parents, schoolteachers, careers teachers, careers officers and employers all do not understand it.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para72"></a>One has to think afresh about how we create out of this situation, through building on it, a coherent strategy for producing the non-graduate skills we seriously lack. There is always the danger that we will look in all directions and continue to do this, that and the other. That will not work; it failed over the past 10 years. We saw that so far as there was a concentration on building up full-time vocational education, it did not produce a major increase in skills. The time has come to recognise that the central part of the strategy must be apprenticeship.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para73"></a>I give three reasons: first, young people like apprenticeship best. A survey showed that students taking modern apprenticeship liked the experience more than students studying full-time for vocational qualifications. That is not surprising; they are being paid and can see the relevance of what they are learning. If we want to engage the one third&#151;at least&#151;of young people who currently stop learning at 16, it is inconceivable that we could do so on a large scale except by that method.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para74"></a>That sounds like dumbing down, but I now want to make the opposite point. Until the big expansion of higher education and sixth forms in the 1960s and 1970s, most children from poor homes who got to the top rose by the apprenticeship route. They often then went on to degree level work. It was madness to close down that route in the belief that somehow the expansion of full-time education had replaced it. Sometimes the astonishment expressed that the social <P>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1040</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>class mix in higher education has not changed shows the naivety of people who believed that that would be the only central instrument for expansion of opportunities. As we know, social mobility has fallen in recent decades. That is not unconnected with the closing down of that route.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para75"></a>Secondly, employers like apprenticeship. It is often said that British employers will not support apprenticeship&#151;that was said in the earlier debates on this topic. But interesting research carried out for the Cassels committee shows that they were not asked. It turned out that even among large employers, only one third had ever been asked to take on a modern apprenticeship.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para76"></a>Thirdly, apprenticeship in those countries that rely mainly on it for non-graduate skills works extremely well. I am talking not only of Germany but also of Denmark and the Netherlands. Those countries have been more successful in controlling youth unemployment than countries such as France or the United States which have relied more on the full-time route.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para77"></a>It is not simply a matter of full-time versus part-time, because in the countries that use apprenticeship the age of entry has been going up. It is typically now 17 or 18. The issue is not one of premature selection but of how we can get people effectively into work with a relevant skill. If one asks how we are doing, modern apprenticeship was re-established under the previous government; an excellent step, but as we know, the quality is often poor and the quantity too small. To deal with both quality and quantity will require a major leadership effort from the top, as with the New Deal, but that is even more difficult.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para78"></a> The particular issue at present, which will focus efforts, is the question of the target for opportunities. It has been discussed before by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. We must have a target for those not going to higher education and it must make sense, be easily understood and pictured, and offer a route into work earning; all the things those young people want. It must be the kind of target that can be set before someone of 13 or 14 as attainable if they work reasonably hard, and that will motivate and satisfy them. It must be the chance of an apprenticeship.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para79"></a>The present figure according to the Government for entry of a cohort into modern apprenticeship at one or other level is 22 per cent. The spending review states it should be 28 per cent by 2004, and for 2010&#151;as has been said&#151;the Cassels committee, of which I was a member, has proposed 35 per cent; perhaps we may call it a third. If the Prime Minister is looking for a target that will fire up young people, it cannot be, as it says in the spending review, a wider vocational target. It has to be something concrete; a target for apprenticeship.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para80"></a>We can have other wider vocational targets, but for heaven's sake let us have the apprenticeship target proposed by the Cassels report; a target that is exciting, simple, concrete, that can fire our youth and be talked about in the pub.

<A NAME="20715-17_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am sure we have all had bad plumbing experiences, even if it was not that that prompted my noble friend. Craftsmen and builders seem to need no tuition in the art of teeth-sucking and acerbic comments on the work of their predecessors. I realise also that they probably need some training in the art, or science, of meteorology, because there always seems to be a problem with the weather, fine or wet, hot or cold.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para81"></a>More seriously, they need training in management skills, in addition to the skills that have been mentioned in the debate. We need more than just a reduction in red tape. By temperament, those who follow such careers are unlikely to want to deal with paperwork&#151;such is my experience. If people are to operate small or medium-sized businesses&#151;even tiny businesses&#151;they must be able to do the paperwork. On a broader level, they need project management skills. The skills needed to run substantial projects seem to be almost wholly lacking in this country.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para82"></a>I recognise that, tonight, I am among an illustrious group of educationists. The question that occurred to me when my noble friend said that she would ask her Unstarred Question was whether the construction industry could cope with the infrastructure that the country needs. I speak from a London perspective, and my figures show that London needs almost 32,000 more homes every year, in order to meet existing need and the forecast extra demand, which is thought to involve expansion equivalent to the size of the city of Leeds over the next 15 years. London is a stark example, but the problem applies elsewhere, if to a lesser extent. In London and elsewhere, we need an improved transport infrastructure. As well as major provision, such as CrossRail in London, we need less headline-grabbing projects. Housing and transport must be developed in tandem in order for our economy to work.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para83"></a>I heard the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on the "Today" programme this morning. He spoke, from an Essex perspective, about the Chancellor's expected announcement about spending on housing. What he said amounted to something like, "Not in Essex, without the transport". I have a more positive view, but the point that he made was important.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para84"></a>There are&#151;properly&#151;ambitious targets for development on brownfield land. The remediation of contaminated land or more small-scale rehabilitation of second-hand buildings seems likely to require greater skills than are required for work on a nice, unsullied site. If we are to accommodate sustainable growth, that is hugely important.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para85"></a>As we have heard, the future is not bright. Recent figures show that the average age of people working in the industry is getting higher. Had she had time, my noble friend would have asked why the Learning and Skills Councils appear to discriminate against the over-19s. The industry wants to encourage 19 to 24 year-olds into apprenticeship, but funding for that group is 56 per cent of that for those aged from 16 to 18. For those over 26, there is no funding.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20715-17_para86"></a>My noble friend mentioned the cost of maintaining qualifications. I was struck by the huge annual cost of maintaining qualifications, which enables people to charge £15 an hour. My professional background is as a solicitor, and I recognise the cost of maintaining qualifications. My profession can charge a great deal more than that to cope with such costs. Over the past five years, the numbers in university courses in building, construction and civil engineering are down by about 50 per cent. We are all aware of the stories of recruitment from overseas and the twice-yearly salary increases, measures designed to keep the industry going.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para87"></a>My noble friend also raised the issue of status and the ideal of a work-based apprenticeship. In Germany, those who teach apprentices are called Meister, and a similar qualification here would do much to indicate the value placed on skills-based qualifications. It is telling that average earnings in the construction industry grew faster than in the economy as a whole. That was not because of the price of materials.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para88"></a>Time is against me. I should like to mention some of the initiatives that are taking place. I assume that my noble friend is not asking what the Government will impose&#151;neither of us wants the Government to impose anything&#151;but what they intend. I hope that we will hear some good news from the Minister.

<A NAME="20715-17_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, not just for bringing the issue before the House but for the passion with which she has spoken on the matter every time that she has had the opportunity. As always with such debates, time is a problem. Therefore, we can scratch only the surface of a debate that deserves a great deal more time.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para89"></a>Our concern about the shortage of people trained in craft skills&#151;especially plumbing and electrical and gas fitting&#151;will strike a chord with many people in the country. Skills shortages extend throughout industry. For example, the construction industry, which has just been referred to, estimates that the sector requires at least another 74,000 people each year up to 2005, simply to fill the gap. Last October, in collaboration with the construction industry, the Department for Work and Pensions launched an initiative with the aim of training and placing 1,000 New Deal workers as electricians, plumbers and bricklayers. However, that scratches only the surface of what is needed. To fill that gap of 74,000, the New Deal attracts only 2,500 people each year into the construction sector. There was yet another initiative, designed to turn single parents into gas fitters, with the intention of creating 4,500 jobs in the energy sector. Will the Minister tell us the extent to which that scheme has been successful? What percentage of the target has been achieved?
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para90"></a>The Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Trade and Industry also published details of a joint venture to encourage,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more than a quarter of young people to enter modern apprenticeships before they are 22 years old by 2004".
<P>

<a name="column_1043"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1043</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That quotation came from a press release issued by the Department for Education and Skills on 29th November last year. Last November, 213,000 16 to 19 year-olds were undertaking modern apprenticeships. Since that was announced, the Learning and Skills Development Agency has published a study saying that the quality of training has fallen, particularly since April 2001. I support my noble friend Lord Trefgarne in congratulating the Engineering and Marine Training Authority on the work that it does to further the skills and training agenda. I also encourage the Minister to respond positively to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about the funding of modern apprenticeships, which appears to discriminate against those aged over 19.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para92"></a> Interestingly, the voluntary sector has had some success with many young people who have found difficult the traditional route through education to training, particularly those who have been disaffected and have shown great reluctance to become involved. For example, UK Skills, based at the offices of the Prince's Trust, presides over many shows and competitions designed to encourage the taking up of skills training. Other examples include Quaker Social Action and the Look Ahead Housing and Care Association, which have trained unemployed and formerly homeless people in basic skills such as plumbing, carpentry and painting. Yet, despite all that is going on, statistics from the Department for Education and Skills show that overall participation in training and employment by young people has declined and that any improvements have been slight.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para93"></a>Although the proportion of 16 to 18 year-olds in full-time education has increased marginally since 1997&#151;by 0.4 per cent&#151;the number of people in government-supported training and employment-funded training has decreased. Between 1997 and 1998, the number of young people starting work-based learning programmes has also decreased by 11,000.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para94"></a>I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord Layard, who called for greater consultation with employers on skills training and greater promotion of such training. That is needed. I know that there is concern about the level of consultation on such matters.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para95"></a>If we look ahead to the outcome of the consultation paper on provision for 14 to 19 year-olds, we can see that work-related training will be costly. The Association of Colleges, the Secondary Heads Association and the National Association of Head Teachers all estimate that a further £372 million will be required. Not only will additional funds be needed for equipment and teaching resources, for example, but also we need a sea change in the staffing situation within our schools and colleges. We know that there are problems of recruitment and retention with regard to science teachers. Furthermore, the underpinning subjects that support the practical and vocational subjects will require more teachers and lecturers of science, maths and technology.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para96"></a>Perhaps I may say en passant that, with hindsight, one of the greatest errors was not to have developed technical education post war. We can all look back and regret that. It has been partly rectified by the introduction of the national curriculum, assessment and testing, the introduction of science and technology into the primary curriculum, the development of vocational qualifications and the introduction of city technology colleges and specialist schools. But we know that there is more to do. Here I echo a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. The gap lies in the underpinning knowledge that supports vocational training. If that were to be rectified, then a great deal of progress could be made.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para97"></a>Increased opportunities for more effective and high quality vocational education has widespread support. The benefits of a better respected vocational stream in our education system would be welcome. It would make for a more competitive workforce and would emphasise that there is more than simply an academic route to personal success and fulfilment. It would encourage many young people who currently feel disaffected to take a greater interest in school. Furthermore, it would go a long way towards increasing respect both for academic and vocational qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para98"></a>To achieve all this we need less gimmickry, far less complexity&#151;another point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing&#151;greater focus and adequate support for the institutions; that is, the schools, training providers and colleges of further education to enable them to deliver the necessary programmes. Above all, we need world-class vocational institutions as much as we need world-class universities. That would go a long way towards producing first-class craft skills such as those asked for by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;plumbers, electricians and gas fitters&#151;in the numbers that the country requires.

<A NAME="20715-17_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, for launching the debate in such a perceptive and effective way. The debate has given us the occasion to discuss an important aspect of the national economy and the welfare of our people. I should emphasise that if in my responses to the numerous questions put to me by the noble Baroness I fail to answer some of them I shall certainly write to her. However, in the limited time we have available I shall do my best to address them all.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para99"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that we must recognise that we still have real skills shortages. An underlying theme of the debate has been that too few of our young people engage in further education and training. The figure of 25 per cent of all young people not taking on further training is ridiculously high for an advanced society such as ours. We need to address ourselves specifically to skills training. I recognise that that has been identified by speakers on all sides of the House, in particular with regard to the craft skills that are so well known to homeowners. I shall draw a veil <P>


<a name="column_1045"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1045</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over my own experience. The builders are still in at my home and I have no wish to complicate an already difficult negotiating position.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para100"></a>However, we are discussing here the wider skills base rather than only those so essential to the home, a point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. We must address the skills requirements that underpin our industrial society and economy. Of course the Government recognise that skills shortages present an important challenge. The gap in productivity&#151;lagging 30 per cent behind Germany and 55 per cent behind the United States&#151;demonstrates that we cannot be complacent about our performance. We still have a long way to go. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, clearly emphasised the main point of the debate; that is, that we need to concentrate on skill levels below graduate provision, in which we are making great strides.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para101"></a>The challenge of maintaining our skills base in an ever-changing world is real, but we should not overstate the present position. Even given the well-recognised gaps with regard to the provision of training, it is still the case that employment levels are high, our economic performance has been good, we have a buoyant labour market, wage inflation remains reasonably stable&#151;well within the range viewed by the Bank of England as consistent with its inflation target&#151;and the Industrial Trends survey from the CBI suggests that employers' concerns about skills shortages are well below recent peaks. That is not to suggest any complacency and in a moment I shall move on to detail how we intend to meet the challenges. However, we ought not to exaggerate the problems or to underestimate the progress which has been made over recent years.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para102"></a>The establishment of the Learning and Skills Council, which several noble Lords have been considerate enough to recognise will need time to bed down and reach its maximum effectiveness, is a sound concept. Its objectives are directed exactly towards ensuring that we have in place a sound strategy for dealing with skills shortages in our society, identifying and then meeting them.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para103"></a>Within that framework, it is important to recognise the crucial role played by employers. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, began his remarks by commending the insights of a former Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, into our industrial skills problems. The noble Lord will forgive me for observing that only a Cross-Bencher would commend to a Labour spokesman former Prime Minister MacDonald. Nevertheless, I recognise that he demonstrated considerable insight into the matter. It is a problem that society has had to face for a very long time.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para104"></a>I wish to emphasise the development of the sector skills councils. The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has been far too modest about his own important role in the development of the technology, engineering and science sector council, which we anticipate will be one of the first to move fully into operation. For the councils to be successful it is important that employers take the lead. The weakness of the former national <P>


<a name="column_1046"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1046</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>training organisations lay, I believe, in the fact that they were constantly making demands on employers without actually meeting their needs. The sector skills councils are designed not only to reflect accurately employers' needs, but to be directed by them in order to discover how any shortages can best be met.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para105"></a>Progress is being made in the area, although I recognise the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that care must be taken over the establishment of the sector skills councils. We cannot afford a failed experiment as a result of which confidence collapses. Thus we are taking the greatest care to involve employers and all other relevant parties in the development of the sector skills councils. However, as I have said, we have already seen conspicuous success in one sector, in which the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has a particular interest.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para106"></a>The sector skills councils have been designed to address some of the points that were made so forcefully in the course of our debate. My noble friend Lord Layard raised the question of modern apprenticeships and the targets that we should set. I agree that it is important to establish clear and realisable targets, which are sufficiently ambitious to force the pace. However, I am not sure that it is sensible to set targets for the proportion of entry into apprenticeships. It is probably better to target the outcomes; that is, the proportion of young people across the board who manage to achieve levels 2, 3 and 4 skills. That is exactly the strategy that the Learning and Skills Council is pursuing, and the Government today announced new targets to improve figures and to encourage the council's ambitions and plans for this work.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para107"></a>The question of support for apprenticeships was raised. Apprenticeships are supported to the extent of £14,000 for an engineering AMA, which exceeds the public funding for a university undergraduate, including loans. So students are not necessarily sold short. I agree with my noble friend Lord Layard that there is a problem in regard to marketing and making attractive the whole area of vocational education and the opportunities it offers. That is a challenge that we need to meet, and this debate has gone some way towards meeting that challenge.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para108"></a>A great deal of the debate focused on the issue of the reforms necessary to modern apprenticeships. The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, generously identified that the numbers of modern apprenticeships in engineering have been increasing, but not at a rate sufficient to meet the needs of the economy and to reflect the opportunities that we wish to provide for our young people.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para109"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred to the Cassels report, to which many Members of the House contributed. It is an important document and points the way forward. We are committed to investing an initial £180 million over the financial years 2001&#150;04 to provide the necessary muscle behind the concepts of that excellent report. We have in place an action plan with the Learning and Skills Council to implement its recommendations, to ensure that all <P>


<a name="column_1047"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>modern apprenticeships meet the highest standards and to encourage take-up by both employers and young people.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para110"></a>My noble friend Lord Layard emphasised that we are in danger of neglecting an important sector of society&#151;that is, those people who have the ability to proceed along vocational routes but who are not sufficiently encouraged or motivated to pursue the strategies which are now in place to ensure successful development. The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, emphasised that we should have the necessary strategy in place for progression so that people who begin at one stage on the ladder do not feel that there are any barriers to prevent them achieving their full potential.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para111"></a> People should be able to advance according to their abilities and reach the highest level possible. We will enhance vocational education in this country once people can see a progression route and an attraction which matches the well-known chartered route through academic qualifications and higher education.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para112"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, referred to further education and the role it can play. The whole House will rejoice at the 1 per cent real increase in support for further education for those colleges whose performances match up to the demanding standards of the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Education. So real resources are being committed to a sector which has been starved of investment in the past and which needs enhancement. Again that is proof of the importance that we place on vocational development.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para113"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, asked about energy aspects. We are attempting to place 4,500 people in jobs in the next three years across occupations in gas and engineering construction. Further research is under way to determine whether there are other occupations within the energy sector which should be included in the strategy. Ambition Energy was officially launched on 10th June. So far, 41 people have progressed to training in energy jobs. During the remainder of this year it is planned that a further 200 places will be available for people undertaking gas network operative training and 400 places in central heating installation. That brings us closer to some of the aspects introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in regard to the needs of home owners.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para114"></a>In conclusion, the Government are seeking to overhaul the skills supply system in this country. We have established the LSC, which will play an important role, and in Wales the National Assembly has gone further by integrating post-16 education and skills with higher education. Business-led regional development agencies have a prime responsibility to bring about the climate in which skills and productivity become the engine of regional and local economic growth. We are introducing sector skills councils and backing them with resources.
<P>

<a name="20715-17_para115"></a>In his Statement today the Chancellor has addressed the question of enhancing the skill levels of this country but a great deal of work has still to be done. <P>


<a name="column_1048"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Mention was made that in some cases we have only a three-year strategy. Once we hit the targets of the three-year strategy we can then plan for the momentum necessary to develop skill levels so that by 2010 we will be in a position to meet many of the targets essential to our nation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-18_para3"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment follows the short debate that we had with the Minister on 18th June when I asked, among other things, whether the Government intended to encourage new gateways for asylum seekers and, in particular, attract recognised refugees to the UK under the managed migration policy. I asked again during the Second Reading debate and I received a sympathetic letter from the Minister, dated 27th June. I am aware that the clause refers to refugees, albeit cursorily, in subsection (3)(a). However, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees believes, and I agree, that there needs to be a much clearer statement in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para4"></a>I do not have the impression that the Government are really committed to the resettlement of refugees as an alternative, even though half the work has already been done for them by the United Nations. Refugees often include among them a high level of skills, and in many instances there are doctors, lawyers and those who have been targeted by a regime precisely because of their professional and sometimes political skills.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para5"></a>I am reassured by the Minister that such people can apply to embassies via the entry clearance officers as long as they meet the United Kingdom criteria&#151;and I would emphasise, as long as there is personal security for them. They may now wish to apply under the skilled migrants' scheme. As the Minister states in his letter,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-18_para6"></a>That would surely have some effect on the illegal trafficking of asylum seekers through places like Sangatte. That point was well understood during the Committee stage in another place. It may be of interest to the Committee that in 2001 Australia received more than 6,000 refugees under UNHCR resettlements, Canada received 10,000, Norway received 1,200 and Sweden received more than 1,000 from countries such as Kenya, Turkey and Pakistan. We are proposing to accept only a few hundred, and not for some time.

<a name="20715-18_para7"></a>I shall try not to take up much more of the Committee's time, but I was disappointed to hear that the UN scheme may take another three to five years to get off the ground. What is the justification for such a delay? What lessons do we still need to learn? We <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>remember from many years ago the resettlement of refugees under various programmes such as those in Indo-China.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para8"></a>I understand the Minister's arguments about the EU scheme and it is essential to encourage those larger countries that do not implement it already&#151;notably France and Germany. At the same time, surely we could go ahead on our own.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para9"></a>As a second part to the amendment, I draw the Committee's attention to an under-used project of UNHCR known as the "10 or more plan". The aim of the scheme is to enable a minimum number of refugees who are physically disabled or who belong to a vulnerable group to be included in a special quota. The UNHCR's view is that 10 is a disappointingly low number, which should be expanded to offer a realistic prospect of protection for the large number of refugees who potentially could fall within that category.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para10"></a>Many of the refugees in that category may have been victims of torture or violence in addition to persecution, and again they will be among the most skilled professionals who have been targeted. They are excluded or made to suffer through no fault of their own even from those societies that claim to receive them as refugees.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para11"></a> Will the Minister consider the matter and give us some assurance that the scheme can be better utilised by the United Kingdom now or in the future? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I recall that during the hostilities and endless fighting that followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, a significant number of people were admitted to this country precisely because they were disabled and/or vulnerable, as referred to in the amendment. I believe that the scheme worked extremely well, and it could well be the precedent for future schemes. In that connection there may be scope both for temporary admission&#151;for hospital treatment or specialist rehabilitation, for example&#151;and for permanent admission for resettlement here. The Explanatory Notes to the clause state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Pilot projects have already been undertaken".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-18_para12"></a>That is nice to know, but will the Minister tell us about those pilot projects? What kind were they and what result was achieved? Can useful lessons be learnt from them?
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para13"></a>My noble friend the Earl of Sandwich mentioned the vexed question of Sangatte in France. I have raised the matter in correspondence and in Questions in your Lordships' House. It is most unsatisfactory, if only because it has led to a considerable number of deaths of people in transit through the Tunnel. It has also severely disrupted freight services, causing loss of employment in this country. I hope that the recent conversations between the Home Secretary and his counterpart in France will lead to significant improvements in the situation in the short term&#151;not next year, or in five years time.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para14"></a>The amendment would open the way for future collaboration between this country and the UNHCR, which might, for example, be asked to identify in <P>


<a name="column_1050"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1050</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>France people who are genuine refugees in its opinion. Having carried out that exercise, the UNHCR could then find out who among them had close connections with the United Kingdom, whether those were personal connections through family and friends, or the community connection of belonging to a minority that is already well established in this country, and which is therefore capable of giving support and assistance. Genuine refugees with a good knowledge of English could be identified. Even among those who are not recognised by the UNHCR as genuine bona fide refugees, it might be possible to acknowledge those who are worthwhile migrants and whose work skills might find an outlet by meeting employment needs in this country. On all those grounds, I ask the Government to give serious consideration to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I should like the Minister to clarify the clause. Subsection (1) clearly sets out the range of projects in which the Government may participate. The Explanatory Notes state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such projects may have as their aim, amongst others, the return of migrants both inside and outside of the United Kingdom to their country of origin by voluntary or compulsory means".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-18_para15"></a>However, Clause 50(4) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (1) does not . . . confer a power to remove a person from the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-18_para16"></a>What is the purpose of that subsection in relation to removing people to their country of origin?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall reply first to the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, about this clause, which in some ways went usefully over the ground of our short debate at Second Reading, which I thought was excellent.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para17"></a>We have set out our commitment to resettlement. In  essence, it recognises that there is a certain happenstance at present as to who can make a case for asylum in Britain. It is driven more by geography&#151;whether people can physically get here to make a claim; or&#151;using words carefully&#151;whether in some cases people have the financial means to pay a trafficker to help them to get here. Therefore, one is aware of the injustice for people, for example, in Central Africa whose need could arguably be significantly greater but there is presently no international process for recognising that need on any scale. All we did in the debate was to recognise that that is a serious issue. Jack Straw, when he was Home Secretary, also marked that in his speech at Lisbon. We reflected that we should be happier in a world, different from how it is now, which allowed more managed processes. All one is saying at this stage is that this is a small but important start to recognise that there ought to be alternative routes to recognise the need to resettle people who are in the greatest need. Whether that would reduce illegal migration, I am less certain. But even if it would not, that is not necessarily a reason for not doing it.
<P>


<a name="column_1051"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1051</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para18"></a>I was asked why such a provision is not on the face of the Bill. As I understand it, it is on the face of the Bill. Clause 50(1)(e) provides wide scope to participate in resettlement, including the provision of financial support to international organisations and financial or other assistance to individual beneficiaries of the resettlement scheme, which is why the provision is so placed.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para19"></a>It was asked why this particular time period was indicated. The UNHCR advised on a time-scale to ensure that the programme was properly set up of between three and five years. We do not have to keep to that time-scale if we feel that we can move more rapidly. Consultation is presently taking place on the setting up of the scheme. The aim would be for the scheme to be be in operation possibly towards the end of 2003&#151;resources permitting, as ever.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para20"></a> We had tended to infer that the amendment focused more on the issue of disability and vulnerability, because the first part of the clause effectively already contains the power to do what the amendment seeks. Clause 50 contains the legal basis for the funding of participation in the quota scheme&#151;the details of which we are developing. It is not designed to set out the details of eligibility, but its wording is deliberately broad, referring to "migrants" rather than to "refugees", to enable us to assist the dependent family of a refugee if the members of that family are not refugees themselves.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para21"></a>I can also assure the Committee that the resettlement gateway will be humanitarian in its nature and will offer asylum in the UK to selected refugees whose life, liberty, safety or other fundamental human rights cannot be protected in his or her country of asylum.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para22"></a>It is inevitable that some of the refugees may be disabled or may have been seriously traumatised by their experiences. I hope that most will be able to use the Ten or More Plan scheme which already provides resettlement for disabled refugees with medical needs. I note the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about the extent to which this has been used. I do not have the answer at my fingertips but I shall write to the noble Lord on the matter and any lessons that we have had from its operation to date that might inform the future development of that or similar schemes.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para23"></a>In operating the new quota scheme, it is likely that the UNHCR will first carry out a selection exercise and then pass on to the UK applications that are thought likely to meet our criteria. We have not yet determined what those criteria will be, but we shall not be discriminating against those with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="20715-18_para24"></a>I hope that my response at least gives some comfort to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. I shall reflect further on any other points that he or other Members of the Committee raised. In the meantime, I invite the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="20715-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   In regard to the Sangatte situation, I have been advised informally that the meeting on Friday with Mr Sarkozy went well. I have seen some press briefing on the matter, courtesy of the Opposition Benches, but I do not have any greater detail as to what happened&#151;apart from saying that we are pretty optimistic that there is an agreement to close the centre and for there to be a timetable for doing so.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para0"></a>There will clearly need to be some process whereby the current inhabitants of Sangatte are appropriately dealt with. I do not intend to venture further into exactly what that process is until I have seen the nature of what was agreed on Friday. It would not help the noble Lord if I did so. No doubt we can give him further details when those details are clear. I shall write to him on the subject. As to the results of the pilot projects, I have no information at present, so I shall similarly send the noble Lord a note on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-19_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   I thank my noble friend for his support, and I am encouraged by what the Minister has said about the timetable.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: As we begin to debate Part 4 of the Bill, I cannot refrain from registering a protest at the way in which this Bill is being handled, and particularly at the necessity to begin this important debate on detention at 14 minutes before nine o'clock, knowing that we have another two hours in front of us to deal with some of the most important provisions in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para6"></a>I resent the way in which the Government are bulldozing this legislation through this place. It would have been much better had adequate time been allowed in the fullness of the day, instead of making us sit night after night, as we have done so far at Committee stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I do not in the slightest want to indulge in an argument with the noble Lord. I thought that we had had some understanding that there would be six days in Committee. Clearly, there have been some tensions at times when we have had Statements. But to the best of my knowledge the liaison between the Front Benches has been most helpful and courteous and I have been appreciative of that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   When those agreements were made, we did not anticipate having Statements day after day, taking up a considerable amount of the afternoon; nor <P>


<a name="column_1053"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1053</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>did we think that, as happened on the previous Committee day, discussion of orders in the dinner hour would take up far more than the hour allotted to them.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para7"></a>I wanted to make that protest because, while matters are agreed between the usual channels and I perfectly well appreciate that my noble friends have been involved in those discussions, there are other Members of this place who need the time to prepare amendments, to table them and to get their heads round what is an extremely complicated piece of legislation. I have made my point and I hope that the Minister will take it into consideration in looking at the timetable for the remainder of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para8"></a>In moving Amendment No. 163A, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 164A and 164B. The first of these amendments is about ensuring that the tests imposed by Article 5.1.f of the European Convention on Human Rights is satisfied by the Secretary of State in exercising his powers under Clause 52(1) to detain a person pending that person's removal. Those words should also have been inserted after the word "detained" in line 27 because the same conditions apply. If the principle were accepted, they should also be inserted in paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act which gives immigration officers similar powers. I realise that the amendment does not completely satisfy the purpose we intended. We should have to tidy it up if the principle were accepted.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para9"></a>In the case of Saadi the Court of Appeal looked at the legitimacy of detention at Oakington where the court was told that in the absence of special circumstances the Secretary of State has determined that it is not reasonable to detain an asylum seeker for longer than about a week. The court found that the manner in which the power of detention was being exercised was within the provision of Article 5.1.f and we entirely agree with that. However, we want to be sure that existing practice is treated as the bench mark and should any future Secretary of State lengthen the period of detention he would come up against the legal barrier that the amendment seeks to impose.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para10"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 164A on written reasons for detention and challenge of the accuracy of those reasons. In the White Paper the Government said that initial reasons for detention would be given by way of a check list similar to that used for bail in a magistrates' court. However, that implies that further and more detailed reasons will be given at some other stage. We discussed this matter about two years ago in a debate on detention in general. The Government then gave an assurance that full reasons for detention would be given to everyone after a fixed interval. So far as I know, that has not happened. It is important that people who are being detained should know in greater detail than a check list the reasons why they are being detained. Similarly, we believe that they should have an opportunity to challenge those reasons so that when the case comes before an adjudicator they will have the full story of why the person was detained in the first place, and the reasons why that person believed that he should not have been detained.
<P>


<a name="column_1054"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1054</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para11"></a>Amendment No. 164B would satisfy a point raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. In paragraph 84 of its report, it stated that Clause 52(7) provides that the powers to detain will be exercisable where the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to suspect that he may make a decision to remove that person but does not expressly provide that it may be exercised only where the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para12"></a>The department told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that the Secretary of State would have reasonable grounds and that if he did not that would be unlawful. We join the Joint Committee on Human Rights in hoping that the courts will take the same view. But we also share its view that in order to avoid any possible doubt we should insert the word "only" before the words "where the Secretary of State" in what was Clause 49(7). It drew the matter to the attention of the House. I now suggest that we follow its advice and put this small amendment in the Bill to ensure that there is no possible doubt. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-19_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   I hope that it will be in the interests of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, as well as the Committee if we debate Amendment No. 167 with Amendment No. 164A relating to the written reasons for detention. I have notified the Minister.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para13"></a>I have argued on previous Bills for written reasons. I believe that the proposed new clause would meet the many concerns of both detainees and of those who visit detainees. I declare an interest here as a patron of the Haslar visitors group. We shall hear more later today about the increase of the use of detention so I shall not detain the Committee on that. Suffice it to say that far too many detainees have been detained before an initial decision has been made. It is particularly important that all detainees understand the reason for their detention. Many will have had previous experiences of police cells, ill treatment or even torture. Therefore, any periods of detention will cause them anxiety. Any detention which does not appear to be justified or to have a time limit will be additionally traumatic.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para14"></a>As I pointed out previously, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate currently provides detainees only with a form now known as 1S91R on which it indicates in broad terms the reasons for detention. No attempt is made to link these general assertions to the detainee's individual circumstances. The information is of little practical use, therefore, to the detainee when coming to hearings. It is essential that a detainee is given reasons which are intelligible or he will not have sufficient information on which to challenge the lawfulness of his detention.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para15"></a>At the Report stage of the Immigration and Asylum Bill in October 1999, several noble Lords argued for full written reasons for detention. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, replied (at col. 897 of the Official Report of 18th October 1999) that the check list would be tailored to individual circumstances. Despite that assurance, the new form did not allow space for a specific reference to the special needs of the individual.

<a name="20715-19_para16"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who was then on the Front Bench, gave a further assurance in his reply that he accepted the points made, the instructions would be reviewed and he hoped that the form would be amended.
<P>

<a name="20715-19_para17"></a>I again raised the issue on 27th March of last year during our debate on the asylum detention rules but received no satisfactory answer. I very much look forward, therefore, to the answer that we shall receive today.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   The amendment to which I speak is grouped with Amendments Nos. 163A, 164A and 164B. Amendment No. 164ZB is not numbered on the Marshalled List but is printed under Amendment No. 164A. It is tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Avebury and myself. At page 28, line 24, the amendment seeks to insert the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Victims of torture, including rape, whose trauma is likely to be compounded by being detained for an indefinite period in conditions which may be reminiscent of those which they fled, will be exempt".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-20_para0"></a>It is similar to Amendment No. 177ZA. I shall speak to both amendments at this stage. I hope that that will be in order.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para1"></a>An interesting point in this clause about the detention by the Secretary of State is that a person may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending. In other words, the Secretary of State has a discretion as to whether a person should be detained. I wish to refer to the evidence which has been given to us about an organisation called Women against Rape. It highlights the devastating effect and impact of being detained in an induction centre and/or a detention centre in particular for women who are already traumatised by their experiences. These often include rape in detention. They experience extreme distress on being incarcerated. In some cases that continues for many months in conditions which remind them of the conditions from which they have fled. Woman suffering from rape trauma syndrome need a very sympathetic environment, independent legal advice, appropriate medical and healthcare, counselling and other support which is not available in such centres. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, pleaded with the Government to be sympathetic to women who suffer because of the situation in which they find themselves. Every immigration and asylum agency can detail such cases and the impact on victims.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para2"></a>We raised this issue during the passage of previous immigration and asylum legislation. We pleaded with government then and we do so again. I do not allege that the Government are heartless; that is the last thing that I should suggest. I am sure that the Government share our concern about such issues. I shall avoid detailing the harrowing examples that have been given to us by various agencies about women who suffer this trauma. This is not simply a question of people being raped in detention; it is also a question of people being <P>


<a name="column_1056"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1056</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tortured. Ample evidence is available from the report of the medical foundation. It highlights case after case of people who undergo that ordeal.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para3"></a>My plea to the Minister is that the Home Secretary should have discretion in this regard. The need for a more compassionate and humanitarian approach will resolve this difficulty. This issue deserves serious consideration. Our decision about the way in which we treat such victims will reflect on our civilised values. I hope that the Minister will not find it inappropriate to agree to the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I suggest that this is one of the most important groups of amendments.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para4"></a>Amendment No. 163A refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reasonable and limited period",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-20_para5"></a>of detention. That is important because it is intended to prevent people being detained and then forgotten. We know that there are currently cases in which people are in detention before they have received their first decision or they are in detention after a first decision and before an appeal has been heard. The amendment would considerably improve the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para6"></a>I turn to the unnumbered amendment which follows Amendment No. 164A in the Marshalled List. Earlier, the Minister mentioned humanitarian criteria as being likely to govern the selection of those people who go to accommodation centres rather than being dispersed, which was helpful. Can he therefore say that those who can bring themselves to mention that in the past they have suffered torture or rape will, if possible, be directed to an accommodation centre? I am aware that it is not always possible for those people to declare that to an unknown government official at an early stage. When it does not happen and no declaration is immediately made, it can still be made at a later stage. At that later stage, it is crucially important that the person should be seen by an expert independent doctor with relevant experience of such cases; for example, those who work with the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para7"></a>Even if the Government criticise the text of the unnumbered amendment which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I hope that they recognise that it contains an important principle.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para8"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 164A, which appears in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Russell. It touches on the essential matter of written reasons. I prefer Amendment No. 167, which was spoken to by my noble friend Lord Sandwich, to which I have added my name. That is fuller, better and clearer. It is needed because the Government refuse to allow automatic bail reviews and because it has been shown that habeas corpus, which is an important part of the history of civil liberties, is an insufficient and inadequate procedure with regard to getting asylum seekers out of detention. I urge that amendment on the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall speak initially to Amendment No. 163A. That amendment would require the detention of persons detained under the power in <P>


<a name="column_1057"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1057</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 52 to be for only a "reasonable and limited period". Although it creates an explicit requirement to detain a person under this clause for no more than a reasonable and limited period, the amendment does not after the wording of the existing powers of detention in the 1971 Act. It is not entirely clear, as drafted, what the inclusion of the word "limited" in this amendment is intended to achieve. If it is intended to require the setting of a time limit for a person's detention under this clause at the point at which it is authorised, I fear that that is simply impracticable; nor do we regard it as necessary.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para9"></a>Setting such a limit at the outset of detention would require considerable predictive ability, which is unrealistic, or the setting of no more than an arbitrary time limit, which might bear no relation to the particular circumstances of the case concerned as it progressed. In either case, it would be odd for the detention of a person under this clause to be subject to a time limit while that was not the case for detentions authorised under the Immigration Act 1971. Moreover, a time limit on detention would be counter-productive in that it would simply encourage those in detention to prolong and frustrate the process so as to reach a point at which they had to be released.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para10"></a>Although there is no express requirement in legislation to detain persons for no more than a reasonable period necessary in the circumstances of each case, domestic and ECHR jurisprudence is clear and well established on this point.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para11"></a>First, the power to detain may only be exercised for the specific purpose authorised by the statute. Secondly, detention is only permitted for so long as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances for that authorised purpose. Thirdly, the detaining authority must act with reasonable diligence with a view to the purpose being pursued. That is well understood and it does not require a statement to that effect on the face of the Bill. For this reason, we feel that the amendment is unnecessary and invite the noble Lord to withdraw it.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para12"></a>Amendment No. 164A would require written reasons for detention to be given to any person detained under the power in Clause 52 with provision for those reasons to be challenged, albeit by unspecified means. These requirements would not apply to any person detained under the powers of detention in the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para13"></a>It is right that detained persons should be notified of the reasons for their detention. It is also right for such persons to be kept informed of the reasons for any continuing detention. It is for these reasons that Rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 requires every detained person to be provided with written reasons for detention at the time of his initial detention and monthly thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para14"></a>In line with this rule, every detained person is served at the time of their detention with a written notice which sets out the Immigration Act power under which detention has been authorised, the reason or reasons for detention, and the factors taken into account in reaching that decision.

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1058</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explained to the detainee, using an interpreter if necessary. The form itself and instructions to staff on its completion make this clear. The noble Lord's amendment does not therefore put in place something which is not, we believe, happening already. On that basis I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para15"></a>I am conscious that in tabling Amendment No. 164B noble Lords are acting on a suggestion made by the JCHR. I am conscious that the committee includes among its members some very eminent legal minds. It is therefore with some trepidation that I suggest that the amendment is, in the Government's view, both unnecessary and potentially confusing.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para16"></a>Unlike the committee, we do not consider that there is any ambiguity in the wording of subsection (7). If the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is someone in respect of whom he is able to make one of the relevant decisions, that person may be detained under this clause. If the Secretary of State does not have reasonable grounds for suspecting that he may make such a decision, there is nothing in subsection (7) that would allow detention on any lesser grounds, however one might define them. For that reason, we say that it is unnecessary to add the word "only".
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para17"></a>The amendment is also, at the very least, potentially confusing and may actually have an effect which I do not think the committee intended. Clause 52 allows the Secretary of State to authorise the detention of certain categories of persons, all of whom may be liable to removal under the powers contained in Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act. In addition, subsection (7) allows this power to be exercised where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual concerned is such a person. In other words, if it turns out that the person who was detained is not such a person, then, provided always that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person could be detained, the detention was not unlawful.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para18"></a>If Amendment No. 164B were to be accepted, however, the circumstances under subsection (7) would not be in addition to the power to detain the persons described in subsections (1) and (2). Instead, on the face of it, subsection (7) would govern the rest of the clause.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para19"></a>On a plain reading of the subsection, as it would read if amended in the way suggested, the power to detain would be exercisable only where the Secretary of State had reasonable ground to suspect that he could make a decision of the relevant kind. But where he had something more than a reasonable ground&#151;where, for example, he might have almost certainty&#151;then perhaps it may not apply. As I say, I do not think that this is the intention of Amendment No. 164B and I hope that my explanation will persuade noble Lords not to press the matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para20"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, helpfully suggested the inclusion of Amendment No. 167 at this stage. It is of course right that the detained person should be notified of the reasons for their detention; it is also right for such a person to be kept informed of the <P>


<a name="column_1059"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1059</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons for any continuing detention. As I indicated, that is why Rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules requires the written notification at the time of the detention and monthly thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para21"></a>In line with this rule, every detained person is served at the time with a written notice which sets out the Immigration Act power under which the detention has been authorised and the reason or reasons for doing so. This must be explained to the detainee, using an interpreter if necessary. The detention of individuals is reviewed monthly, assuming it lasts that long. If, following the review, a detainee is to remain in detention, he will be given a written update on the progress of his case, together with the reasons for maintaining detention.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para22"></a>The noble Earl's new subsection therefore does not put in place something which is not required already. It would, however, require rather more than the present position: to be frank, more than is necessary or practicable, namely that the written notice of reasons for detention should be translated into a language understood by the detainee concerned and that it should not be on a pro forma.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para23"></a>So far as the language is concerned, this option has been considered previously and has been rejected as impracticable and unnecessary. The existing notice has to be explained to the detained person and, if necessary, it must be done with the interpreter. This ensures that the detainee understands the reason for detention. In almost all cases the detainee's advocate is likely to be able to read English, and the documentation served in English makes it absolutely clear to the detainee's advocate the power and the reasons for detention. While interpreting is possible, it would be another thing for the notice to be translated and served on the detainee without delay.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para24"></a>There has been some criticism of the detention reasons notice being a pro forma. The clear intention behind Amendment No. 164A is that it should be an individually tailored letter in every case. I do not accept that the pro forma provides any less information on the reasons for detention than would realistically be given in a letter. It is certainly not the case that the current notice provides only generalised reasons for detention. It sets out the specific power of detention used and specifies the particular reasons and factors that apply to the decision to detain in the case concerned. A letter drawn up for each case would do no more and would be likely only to introduce further delay. For those reasons, we do not consider it necessary.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para25"></a> To amplify that, the checklist contains all current policy reasons for detention and the factors to be taken into account when detaining. Therefore, it addresses the individual circumstances of the person being detained. That meets the commitment made by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. The form is kept under review, as my noble and learned friend Lord Williams undertook.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para26"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, also spoke to the important Amendments Nos. 164ZB and 177ZA. I strongly sympathise with the sentiments that lie <P>


<a name="column_1060"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1060</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>behind the amendments and the serious issues that they address, even though I do not think that they are necessary. We made it clear in our 1998 White Paper, Fairer, Faster and Firmer, that evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release when deciding whether to detain while an individual's asylum claim is being considered. That remains the case.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para27"></a>The instructions to staff authorising detention are clear on that. Independent evidence that a person has a history of torture is one of the factors that must be taken into account when deciding whether to detain and would normally render the person concerned unsuitable for detention other than in exceptional circumstances. Such evidence may emerge only after the detention has been authorised. That may be one of the circumstances referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. If that happens, the evidence will be considered to see whether it is appropriate for the detention to continue.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para28"></a>We reinforced that in the Detention Centre Rules 2001. Rule 35(3) specifically provides for the medical practitioner at the removal centre to report on the case of any detained person who he is concerned may have been the victim of torture. There are systems in place to ensure that such information is passed to those responsible for deciding whether to maintain detention and to those responsible for considering the individual's asylum application.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para29"></a>However, unfortunately, there cannot be a blanket and total exclusion for anyone who claims that they have been tortured. There may be cases in which it would be appropriate to detain somebody who has a history of torture. For example, the person concerned might be a persistent absconder who is being returned to a third country. It might be necessary to detain such a person to effect removal. There will be other cases in which the particular circumstance of the person justifies such an action. There will be yet other cases in which we do not accept that the person concerned has been the victim of torture. Despite that, I repeat my earlier comments about the importance of seeking to interpret these cases with the utmost care and not lightly using the exceptions to which I referred.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para30"></a>The amendment, which would not apply to any person detained under the detention powers in the 1971 Act, would reduce what can be a difficult area to a blanket exemption in a way that is, by definition, overly prescriptive and open to considerable debate and argument as to whether all its conditions have been met in a particular case.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para31"></a>Amendment No. 177ZA contains similar, although not identical, wording. It is out of place in Clause 59. People are not detained on induction programmes and nor, to use the wording of the amendment, could they be seen as "reminiscent" of detention from which a person has fled. A stay near an induction programme will be short-term. The places where people will reside will have no resemblance to detention and there is no reason to make a blanket exemption from the provision in Clause 59 for those who have been tortured. I repeat that I am entirely sympathetic with <P>


<a name="column_1061"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1061</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the sentiments underlying the amendments, but I hope that what I have explained goes some way to relieving the concerns that have been expressed.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para32"></a>I also noted the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about whether those who have suffered torture and rape should be able to go to accommodation centres rather than being detained. I understand the spirit of what he is saying. However, accommodation centres do not have any detention process, so they would be unlikely to provide the necessary security if there is believed to be a need to detain. I hope that the noble Lord's concern is addressed by testing seriously whether detention is necessary when there is a potential case of torture. I referred earlier to the noble Lord's point about whether the declaration could be made later. The responsible officials should attend to that and give it serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para33"></a>Finally, with regard to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, concerning a reasonable and limited period, the implied requirement is already accepted that detention will be for no longer than necessary in the circumstances. Detention cases must also be kept under review with regular internal reviews. As I said previously, detention centre rules require reasons for detention to be given on a monthly basis.
<P>

<a name="20715-20_para34"></a>I regret having spoken at such length but, of course, Members of the Committee grouped together a number of amendments and I needed to speak to five or six at the same time.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may ask him some questions relating to Amendment No. 167 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, concerning detention centre rules. The Minister was good enough to tell us what the rules were all about and how they were being exercised. But Bail for Immigration Detainees, which has considerable experience in this matter, has drawn my attention to the fact that, although Rule 9 requires the Immigration Service to give reasons for detention on a monthly basis, in its experience detainees are rarely given such reasons in the monthly report which they receive from the service. That is a matter of very serious concern.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para0"></a>The issue has already been taken up with the Home Office, but I have been given to understand that the Immigration Service has not yet considered it appropriate to discipline immigration officers who fail, in their monthly reports, to give reasons for detention.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para1"></a>That is a serious matter which has a number of consequences. One is that it is very difficult for a detainee to prepare a bail application if he does not know the reasons for his detention. When previously unknown reasons for detention are advanced by the Immigration Service at a bail hearing, effectively that delays the decision and causes the whole procedure to be adjourned. On the basis of contributions made in the other place, I understand that that may be one reason for discussing the removal of the whole bail <P>


<a name="column_1062"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1062</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision. It undermines Rule 9, and I should be very grateful if the Minister would give the matter serious consideration. The factors that I have set out breach the rule. I do not consider that to be right or proper, and I believe that appropriate action should be taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for his further question. I also thank him for the information that he offered on Rule 9 and for setting out, following advice from specialist immigration organisations, his belief that the rule is not adequately complied with. It is a serious issue, and perhaps the noble Lord would supply me with the best evidence that he has. Over the summer I shall undertake to look at that evidence and seek to make other inquiries. I shall also aim to have a further discussion with him before Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am most grateful to Members of the Committee who have taken part in this debate on a series of amendments. I hope that the Minister will have noticed that other noble Lords whose amendments were not grouped with this set have voluntarily grouped their amendments, thus saving the Committee's time and speeding up the process of discussion. The fact that they did so was a useful exercise because these amendments, including that in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and those in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, were directly relevant to the three amendments which were grouped initially.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para2"></a> First, the Minister said that the time limit would require predictability, which is not in the possession of Ministers or immigration officers. He also said that, although there is no express requirement to limit detention to a reasonable period, domestic and European legislation demand that detention should be imposed only for a period which is reasonably necessary.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para3"></a>I could accept that if the outcome was that people suffered detention only for periods that were reasonably necessary. Bail for Immigration Detainees has just given me four examples of cases where people were released from detention after periods of six months, nine months, four months and eight months. I do not think that those periods were reasonable, and so the outcomes have not been in accordance with the assurances given by the Minister. The matter needs to be considered further.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para4"></a>With regard to the written rules, the Minister gave a useful assurance to my noble friend that he would consider the examples supplied by the agencies. While he is doing that, perhaps he will look at the question of translation in the light of the fact that determinations from the asylum support adjudicators are all translated before being served because of the importance of the decision and the reasons given therein. I do not understand why the same should not apply to the decisions about the liberty of the individual which to us are no less important. If it can be done in one case, it should be done in another. I hope that the Minister, in looking at the information to be supplied to him by my noble friend, will also take that matter into account.
<P>


<a name="column_1063"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1063</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para5"></a>The question of the JCHR recommendation is a complicated matter. I do not profess to have fully taken on board the reasons given by the Minister in his reply. It is perhaps best if I leave that to be considered by the JCHR and perhaps it will offer further advice to the Minister. There was a dialogue between the JCHR and the Minister and it is surprising, if he put the arguments forward, that they did not prevail. It held to its view in spite of the fact that, as the Minister said, the committee is composed of people who are extremely well qualified in the law and particularly in human rights law.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para6"></a>Finally, on the question of torture, will the Minister think about the systems that are in place to ensure that information is passed to the appropriate officials? The detention centre rules provide only that a report should be made from the doctor, through the centre manager, to the Secretary of State; they are silent on what the Secretary of State should do with that information. A lacuna occurs in the rules which needs to be examined. If the Secretary of State is not under any obligation to take cognisance of the information submitted to him, people who have suffered torture or rape may be detained for a long time.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para7"></a> An example sent to me by BID concerned a female asylum seeker who had been severely traumatised by her experiences in her country of origin. She remained in detention awaiting appeal, during which time her mental health continued to deteriorate. She was held for over four months. It would be interesting to know how the system went wrong. Presumably when the information comes up from the doctor to the Secretary of State, some action is taken which feeds back to the detention decision-maker, and the person with growing mental health problems who is being detained will be promptly released. The fact that that does not happen is a matter of serious concern to us.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para8"></a>I shall leave those matters for the Minister to reflect on throughout the Summer Recess, as shall we. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="20715-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>   moved Amendment No. 164:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 28, line 24, leave out "that paragraph" and insert "any of those paragraphs"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-21_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a drafting point. It is intended to make the wording conform more closely to the rules of syntax of the English language. Perhaps the Minister will speak to his amendments in this group, but they concern an entirely different point.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para11"></a>A person may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending a decision by the Secretary of State whether to give directions under one of three paragraphs of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act. Once the Secretary of State has given directions for a person's removal, he has the power to detain that person pending his removal. I understand the purpose of the clause, which is to enable the official who conducts the <P>


<a name="column_1064"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1064</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examination of the asylum seeker, to make the decision to detain on behalf of the Secretary of State. We have no quarrel with that.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para12"></a>As to the wording, in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the words "that paragraph" always refer to a single paragraph. In Sections 116, 117 and 120 that phrase refers to paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 to the Act and in paragraphs 60 and 126 of Schedule 14 it refers to only a single paragraph and not to two or more paragraphs. On the other hand, in Section 140 of the 1999 Act the words "any of paragraphs", followed by some numbers, refers to several different paragraphs.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para13"></a>The precedents refer to one paragraph and I believe that it would be less confusing if this amendment were to be accepted. I hope that the Minister will agree. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Lord invites me to move the government amendments in this group, as I shall. As a matter of courtesy I shall deal with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, first. We are extremely grateful to the noble Lord for his suggested amendment, but we believe that it is unnecessary. I can, however, see what prompted the noble Lord to table it.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para14"></a> However much it may jar on the ear or the eye, the use of the singular in subsections (1)(b) and (2)(d) is, according to our best advice&#151;no doubt parliamentary draftsmen&#151;correct. The true position under subsection (1)(a) is that it allows the Secretary of State to authorise detention pending a decision whether or not to give removal directions under one or other of those paragraphs. But the eventual directions, if and when they are given, will be under only one of the three. It would be pointless to set removal directions under more than one, even if that were possible.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para15"></a>Thus, subsection (1)(a) allows a person to be detained on the authority of the Secretary of State pending a decision by the Secretary of State. Similarly, subsection (1)(a) allows a person to be detained on the authority of the Secretary of State pending a decision by the Secretary of State, and so on. Finally, subsection (1)(a) permits detention pending a decision under paragraph 14 and subsection (1)(b) allows the person to be detained where directions have been given under that paragraph.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para16"></a>In other words, subsection (1) contains a single new power which allows the Secretary of State to authorise detention, first, pending a decision whether or not to set removal directions under one of three possible paragraphs, and then when directions have been given under the applicable paragraph. We believe that in terms of drafting, the amendment, although intended to be helpful, is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 165 and 166 are minor and technical amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 and are consequential upon the power of detention contained in Clause 52. They are necessary to ensure that those detained under the power in Clause 52 are on the same footing as persons detained under the detention powers in the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1065</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-21_para18"></a>At present the 1983 and 1984 Mental Health Acts refer only to persons detained under the 1971 Act. The amendments to the provisions in those Acts relating to the transfer of detained persons requiring mental treatment will extend their scope to include persons detained under Clause 52. There are no substantive changes to the 1983 and 1984 Acts. Therefore, they are benign, helpful, minor and technical.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   Can the noble Lord give some indication as to how bad one's mental health must to be before one becomes "susceptible to transfer"? In prisons in this country there are thousands of people whose mental health is bad or poor and who need treatment but cannot get it because there are insufficient places in mental hospitals. Can the Minister throw some light on whether so far anyone has been transferred out of immigration or asylum detention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may try to support the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I tried to understand&#151;as best I could&#151;the Minister's explanation to the points raised by the noble Lord. It may be that on close scrutiny of Hansard it will make rather clearer sense. But why should we be put to this extraordinary intellectual exercise? Instead of being brought up with a round term by this curious construction, surely life could be made much easier for everyone who has to deal with this issue if the word "the material" was inserted between "under" and "paragraph". Therefore, Clause 52(1)(b) would read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"removal of the person from the United Kingdom in pursuance of directions given by the Secretary of State under the material paragraph".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-22_para0"></a>It would then be perfectly clear what we are talking about. Instead of having this extraordinary exercise, perhaps I may suggest that to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I always enter with some trepidation any debate with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden. I am sure that with his legal mastery he is a draftsman of extraordinary talent. I certainly shall take account of his suggestion, which the officials will have noted. I think that what I said in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was right and attempted to establish a degree of consistency and understanding around the use of the terms. We are always open to new ideas and suggestions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Is the Minster taking the suggestion of my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew so seriously that he will write to him with his conclusions on this matter before we reach the Report stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am happy to agree to that. I always listen with great interest to the wisdom of the noble and learned Lord. We shall afford him the courtesy of a written reply.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para1"></a>I shall offer the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, a similar facility. He has asked a question which requires a degree of research. With apologies to the noble Lord, I am happy to investigate and to see what information, such as it is, we can find out on numbers and types of cases. It is an important issue and deserves a proper response. I am grateful for those two important points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, for his comments. The existing wording is inconsistent with the Government's professed aim of making legislation more conformable with the English language. Whatever the Minister may say&#151;I listened carefully to his convoluted explanation&#151;I do not think that the present wording is readily comprehensible by those who need to understand it.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para2"></a>Therefore, although my wording may not have been ideal&#151;I happily accept the alternative offered by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew&#151;at least the Minister, together with his department, should consider whether some other form of words would make more sense to ordinary readers of the English language.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para3"></a>With regard to the amendment proposed by the Minister relating to the Mental Health Act 1983, I am happy to accept that those detained should be treated in the same way as those who have been detained under the 1971 Act, but the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked a serious question, bearing in mind that we know that there is a gross deficiency of places in secure psychiatric units. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, may know, when the Select Committee recently considered the problem of transferring people from prisons to hospitals, which he mentioned, it found a shortage of about 500 places.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para4"></a>More recently, Dr John Reed of Her Majesty's Prisons Inspectorate told me that the number of places is still deficient. There are still 500 fewer places than are needed to accommodate the people who should be transferred from prisons into secure psychiatric units, so we may assume that the same is true of people in detention. People who need to be transferred into psychiatric units from places of detention may be held continuously in the place of detention because there is no room for them in a psychiatric unit. It is important that that is clarified. I also look forward to receiving the information that the Minister promised during the summer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-22_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Does my noble friend remember an occasion on which Lord Taylor of Gosforth, who was Lord Chief Justice, when offered that excuse that no bed was available in a mental hospital, summoned the Secretary of State for Health to appear as a witness in person? Is it not about time for that example to be repeated?

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>was not altogether a question of capacity, but also one of process.

<br>
 "It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State&#151;
<br>
(a) to issue a code of practice in connection with the tape-recording of interviews of persons examined by an immigration officer under paragraphs 2, 2A or 3 above; and
<br>
(b) to make an order requiring the tape-recording of persons so examined."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-22_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: If accepted, the amendment would bring into operation the practice of tape-recording interviews with immigration detainees. At the moment, many interviews are conducted without representatives. The quality of interpreters is variable; there is no recognised qualification they have to attain in order to become interpreters. Interview notes are not read back to the applicant; he only has to countersign in order to verify identity.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para17"></a>At Oakington, where proper advice is available to  asylum seekers, lawyers frequently identify discrepancies and inaccuracies that can be corrected on the spot. In one recent case of a Zimbabwean rape victim who arrived in April 2001, she applied in August and was interviewed when still in acute distress. The Refugee Legal Centre picked up five pages of inaccuracies and misrepresentations in the interview record.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para18"></a>When interviews are conducted at an airport or at Croydon, frequently there may not be a representative present or the applicant is not given an adequate opportunity to contest the reliability or accuracy of the written record. With a tape recording the quality of the evidence would be enormously improved, to the advantage of both parties and in the interests of making the process faster and fairer, as we all wish to do.
<P>

<a name="20715-22_para19"></a>The wording of the amendment is taken from Section 60 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It has long been considered that the criminal justice system is best served by having an accurate record of what is said at interviews. Surely the tried and tested procedures adopted in such cases would read across into the determination of asylum claims. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I support the amendment. Last night, rather later than I would have wished, and therefore without the time to complete the reading I would have wished, I started to read the pamphlet Deciding to Detain, a report by the University of Essex Human <P>


<a name="column_1069"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1069</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Rights Centre by Leanne Weber and Todd Landman. It suggests to me that a great deal of the decisions taken that lead to detention&#151;often mistaken detention&#151;arise from mistakes in the initial interview. That is not a new thought on these Benches or in the House. But what is so good in the report is that it allows the immigration officers to speak for themselves in a vernacular speech that I can understand.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para0"></a>I hear in those immigration officers a sense of having lost control of the processes of their job, which as a professional is something I recognise far more closely than I would have wished. They often regard it as their job to prevent people coming into this country. I cannot complain at that. I am not a vegetarian: I cannot morally reprove people who work in abattoirs. I do not want Al'Qaeda and the Mafia walking all over this country with every weapon they possess. So I recognise that there must be people with that vocation.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para1"></a>But the point that the immigration officers make is that that vocation and the vocation of dealing with asylum sit uneasily together. Here is a quote from one:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A colleague of mine at Dover said 'If I'd wanted to join an organisation that processed asylum claims I'd have joined the Immigration Advisory Line or something, I wouldn't have joined the Immigration Service'. Because we're not doing the immigration control&#151;we're simply letting people through. That's what I said about asylum being a separate issue from immigration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-23_para2"></a>In those words is not only the frustration of someone who sees himself as having lost control of his job. There is also a clear expression of why immigration and asylum should be seen as two separate functions of the Home Office. They ought not to be done by the same people. If they were done by two lots of people with different vocations and different professional training, we would not get what the report suggests that we are getting&#151;people recommending detention because it is the only way they can get back control of the process.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para3"></a>If anything like that is taking place&#151;I say, "If"&#151;the tape recording of interviews, as proposed in my noble friend's amendment, would go a long way to correct it. Beyond that, the material suggests that there is a long-term way in which our immigration and asylum system could be reformed. As I suggested at Second Reading of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Bill, without the evidence that I now have, it would involve separating the immigration functions from the asylum functions and having them done by different people. That would be the beginning of wisdom. Until it is done, things will go wrong over and over again, and we will be back here for another Bill, almost before we have finished this one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   I hope that the Minister will consider seriously the point covered by the amendment. I urge him to do so for two reasons. First, I do not think that I am speaking only for myself when I say that the Minister has convinced us of his decency, his integrity and his determination to see as much justice as possible in the administration of policy and theory. If there is any serious room for doubt&#151;there seems to be a good deal in this area&#151;the proposed amendment would, as <P>


<a name="column_1070"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1070</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, go a long way towards removing that doubt. That is important for justice.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para4"></a>The second reason why I urge the Minister to take the proposal seriously is that, if we take seriously the threat of terrorism&#151;I, for one, certainly do&#151;we must remember at all times that the extremist plays on any sense of injustice or justice miscarried. It is counter-productive to do things in a way that is not beyond question or doubt. It plays into the hands of extremists and gives them moral grounds for recruiting and increasing their circle of ambivalent support, if not direct support. That is the kind of climate in which it is easier for them to operate. For those reasons, regardless of whether we accept this particular amendment, the point behind the amendment is crucially significant. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will reassure us that he takes it seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I endorse what has just been said. I hope that the Minister will say that he will consider the point behind the amendment, if he cannot accept its precise terms. During that consideration, he should take into account the Home Office's experience of piloting and introducing the tape recording of interviews under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para5"></a>At the beginning, there was a great deal of resistance from the police. Subsequently, the police realised that it was as much in their interest to have an objective and unassailable record of what had taken place as it was in the interest of the defendant. It is easy, with the best of intentions, to put a slant on an interview during which one has been able only to make running notes. Police officers, particularly those who conducted the trial&#151;at Dartford in Kent, I think&#151;became the most ardent protagonists on behalf of the innovation. Today, nobody would wish to go back to the days when there was no tape recording. I hope that the Minister will consider that example.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I wish to support the amendment because it bears not only on the quality of interviewing in the first place, but also on the quality of interpretation. Both are closely linked to the quality of first decision and therefore to the avoidance of further appeals and judicial reviews. We all understand that that is what the Government wish to see and we support them in that aim.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para6"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, raised important structural questions with regard to the Home Office. Perhaps I may follow his line by asking the Home Office seriously to consider changing the way it operates the system so that one caseworker stays with a case throughout the whole process until it is finally resolved. That would bring about a huge qualitative improvement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I wish to endorse what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Hylton, and my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden. Indeed, I have to say quite candidly to the <P>


<a name="column_1071"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1071</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister that I had always assumed that such interviews were tape recorded. Indeed, I could not imagine the circumstances in which they would not be recorded. Surely it would be in the interests both of the person being interviewed and of the interviewer that the most accurate record of what has taken place is available, first, to both the parties participating in the interview and, secondly, for any subsequent proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para7"></a>I understand that the Government's objective behind the Bill is to secure expedition tempered by fairness. What better way of soundly establishing such a procedure than by making sure that, at the outset, the interviews are accurately recorded? The barriers of language and culture are huge. It is difficult to see how we shall have a reasonable chance of overcoming them unless we start off in the way proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We have had an interesting short debate. It took my mind back to the passage of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Arguments were put forward from both the police and civil liberties perspectives to say that the tape recording of interviews would not be a good move. Ultimately I think that both sides of the arguments came to see that they were wrong and that the government of the day were absolutely right. The tape recording of interviews conducted in police stations has marked a tremendous advance in openness and transparency and has assisted both the defence and the prosecution in equal measure. Furthermore, it has added greatly to the fairness of the process.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para8"></a>I am going to give a commitment to reflect on the amendment moved by the noble Lord, but I give that commitment to reflect without a further commitment that there will be an amendment or a solution that necessarily accords with the spirit of the amendment before the Committee. I shall do that because there are certain immense logistical problems that would come into play if the Government were to follow this course. I wish to make that point plainly and ensure that it is put on the record.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para9"></a>Each year something in the order of 90 million passengers arrive in the United Kingdom. Of those, some 13 million are subject to some form of control by the UK Immigration Service at ports and at the Channel Tunnel. Plainly, aiming to tape record up to 13 million interviews a year would be a vast exercise. I do not know whether one would need to record all 13 million interviews; I doubt whether eventually it would be quite that number. However, some of those interviews would include those conducted with British and European citizens because some mistakes would be made. That could lead to long delays for people coming here quite legitimately in being received into the country.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para10"></a>We also need to consider the enormous cost of installing tape-recording machinery at every control desk at every port and point of entry. There are <P>


<a name="column_1072"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1072</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>questions of practicality. If one thinks of ports and the facilities available there for the conducting of interviews, the quality of the interview rooms that we now demand in police stations and the technology used, one begins to get a fair measure of the practical difficulties.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para11"></a>The current system works reasonably well and there are fairly good and accurate records of interviews. Safeguards are in place. While I accept that recorded interviews would add something more and that there is an initial attraction to their introduction, many problems would need to be overcome in terms of language, recording and so on.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para12"></a>Attractive though this amendment is, and though I am happy to give a commitment that we will reflect on the comments made by noble Lords in this short and interesting debate, I can go no further. I can give only an agreement to reflect, without a commitment or promise that we will bring back anything. I appreciate that the amendment is intended to be helpful.
<P>

<a name="20715-23_para13"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred to the Deciding to Detain report and was candid in extracting the comments of immigration officers. The research took place some years ago and involved a small number of immigration officers. We should like to place on record our debt of gratitude to our immigration officers. They have to work extremely hard and intervene in many challenging circumstances. I am sure that the noble Earl will accept that much has changed in their working practices and that perhaps Deciding to Detain no longer accurately reflects the current position in the context of their work and the changed role and nature of our Immigration Service, which has had to match and meet some very testing circumstances over the past few years. I am grateful to the noble Earl for raising points from the report, but his comments need to be set in context.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I welcome the Government's willingness to reflect. It is perhaps the first time it has happened during the course of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   No, it is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   No? I accept that. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, rightly pointed to the logistical difficulties implicit in the text of the amendment. However, the Government's problems would be enormously reduced if the tape-recording experiment started only with first interviews in asylum cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I take the noble Lord's point. If the focus of the amendment was narrower, it might have some greater potential benefit in those kinds of cases. The amendment is broadly constructed as it stands and its remit would be to place on the service considerable administrative burdens, delays, costs, and so on. Despite its initial attractiveness, there is a fundamental problem with the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The report Deciding to Detain to which I referred was not volume one, which was issued a little <P>


<a name="column_1073"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1073</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>while ago, but volume two, which is this year's report. Although I recognise that situations change, if the proportion between asylum and immigration has changed in favour of immigration and against asylum, why do we have the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am enormously grateful to my noble friend Lord Russell and to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, and the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Kingsland.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para0"></a>Everyone who has spoken in the debate is in favour of the principle of tape recording. The only objection came from the Minister who said that it was administratively impracticable. He gave a sort of undertaking. I am not sure whether it was to review the position over the summer or to think about what has been said in the debate. He dropped a hint towards the end of this remarks that he might have looked more favourably on the amendment had it been confined to the interviews with asylum applicants because that would cut the numbers from a potential 12 million to something less than 76,000. We shall think about the matter during the summer and decide whether to table an amendment which is limited to asylum applicants, as the Minister suggested.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para1"></a> My noble friend Lord Russell referred to decisions to detain. The Committee may remember the case of the Afghans who arrived on Ariana Airlines and were segregated in the fire service college over a weekend when interviews were held. They were reported on by an interpreter and showed the enormous pressures that were brought to bear on those people not to make an application for asylum but to return to Afghanistan. That followed an undertaking by the then Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, now Foreign Secretary, that he would get rid of these people as rapidly as possible.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para2"></a>That is what happens when there are no proper recordings of interviews. It is possible for serious pressure to be brought to bear on applicants for asylum not to pursue that intention but to go back to their countries of origin. That could be avoided if interviews were tape-recorded.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para3"></a>I refer the Minister to a report by the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate dated July 1999 on the asylum decision process consultancy. There are several paragraphs relating to taping all substantive interviews. Paragraph 6.34 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "taping interviews reduces the opportunity to dispute what was  said during an interview . . . may encourage greater professionalism by the interviewer and interpreter and . . . the trial"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-24_para4"></a>which was undertaken by the Home Office, so we need not start again from scratch&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has apparently indicated that applicants and their advisers have also behaved more professionally during the interview".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-24_para5"></a>The saving in time and costs compared with the conventional process was threefold. Therefore, it is not a matter of enormous cost to accept the spirit of the <P>


<a name="column_1074"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1074</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. It would be a saving as well as an enormous benefit to practitioners and their clients. We shall return to the matter on Report with the modification that the Minister has suggested limiting it to asylum applicants. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para7"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 53 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I oppose Clause 53 stand part in order to pave the way for Amendments Nos. 171 and 172, the purpose of which is to consolidate the amendments made to the all-important Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 in this Bill with the schedule as amended. Technically it is not a true consolidation because, in addition to the task of reordering and renumbering the schedule itself to incorporate all the changes made to it since 1971, we would have to amend all the references made to the schedule in other legislation, and the matter would have to be referred to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills and the Law Commission to justify the term.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para8"></a>I am greatly indebted to the Public Bill Office for the assistance that it has given me in accomplishing part of the task and I hope that between us we shall have done enough to demonstrate the usefulness of the exercise and convince your Lordships that it should be completed.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para9"></a>We have taken Schedule 2, as amended, and inserted in it the words specified in Clauses 53 and 54. We should also have dealt with Clause 62(1) in the same way, but unfortunately through an error of mine, it was transformed into Amendment No. 179. But the wording of Clause 53 now appears as paragraph 18(2) of the revised schedule, and the wording of Clause 54 as new sub-paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of that paragraph. The further tidying up still necessary would be to insert the words of Clause 62(1) after what becomes paragraph 11 in the renumbered schedule, and to renumber all the following paragraphs.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para10"></a>The effect of these amendments would be to enable practitioners, IND staff and clients to read the whole schedule as amended, instead of having to refer back to all the legislation that has been passed since 1971 to get the complete picture. I appreciate that it is possible to buy reference books that show how the 1971 Act appears with all the amendments, such as Margaret Phelan's excellent Immigration Law Handbook. But as fast as these tomes appear, Parliament comes along with fresh legislation and one has to spend another £40 on keeping up to date. This Government seem to have lost interest in consolidation, so let Parliament take a small step towards making the statutes easier to read, as an example that we should like all departments, but particularly the Home Office, to follow. I commend my amendments to the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In keeping with earlier debates, I was expecting views to be expressed on all sides of the Committee, but plainly that has not happened. I have quite a long briefing note on this <P>


<a name="column_1075"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1075</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter. However, I am mindful of the hour and am thinking that the several pages of justification for the current situation are not something that Members of the Committee will want to hear.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para11"></a>We are grateful for the thought that lies behind the amendments in this group. I cannot accept the noble Lord's point that the Government are not interested in consolidation. My recollection is that we recently had a mini-debate on the subject. I believe it was my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer who made the point that there had been some consolidation during this Government's period of office and that further consolidation was very much in our minds.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para12"></a>We recognise the case that has been made for consolidating the Acts relating to immigration and asylum. The noble Lord made a fair point. But we cannot practically do that before the whole reform package has been perfected and put together. However, we are committed to consulting the Law Commission about consolidation in due course.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para13"></a>I recognise that "in due course" can mean "as long as a piece of string". But we are committed to this. It makes good and apparent sense. So although we do not intend to include consolidation measures in the Bill&#151;and for that reason I cannot accept the amendments&#151;we recognise it as important and significant. We are grateful to the noble Lord for raising this matter. It is right that he does so.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para14"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will take some encouragement from my response. I ask him not to press the amendments that he has tabled.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-24_para15"></a>"Give me chastity, but not yet". The noble Lord expects me to be satisfied with an assurance that consolidation of the immigration Acts will happen at some time in the future. I suppose that I have to be pleased that he has given me that assurance, because I cannot expect anything more this evening. I hope that at least this debate has shown that the task is not so enormous. If the Public Bill Office can manage to supply half the work of consolidating the most important schedule of the 1971 Act, I am sure that it is not beyond the resources of the department to carry on and do the rest of the work.
<P>

<a name="20715-24_para16"></a>So I hope that the Government will take this matter seriously and that we shall not have to wait indefinitely for consolidation when so much depends on it for immigration practitioners, for clients and for the IND. In the meantime, I shall not oppose the Question and I shall not press my amendments.

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1076</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 169 would require any searches carried out by detainee custody officers, under the powers to be conferred on them by the proposed new sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, to be conducted in accordance with rules made by the Secretary of State. This amendment seeks to raise the question of how the conduct of detainee custody officers will be regulated when, as is envisaged under the provisions to be inserted under Clause 54 of the Bill, they enter premises to conduct searches and detain persons for whom they are responsible.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para2"></a>The Government propose to allow detainee custody officers to enter private premises without consent in order to conduct those searches&#151;although they will be able to do so only where an immigration officer or a constable has entered the premises under a warrant. The existing power to search, the definition of which is referred to in the proposed new sub-paragraph (5) is contained in paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para3"></a>The conduct of police officers is obviously regulated by a number of well-known provisions, not least those of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The amendment seeks to clarify the provisions that will apply to detainee custody officers in circumstances where they have entered private premises by force for the purpose of carrying out a search.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para4"></a>Can the Minister tell the Committee whether the rules on the searches by those custody officers, which are referred to in paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to the 1999 Act, have been made; and, if so, whether they contain an adequate framework for the conduct of custody officers in the circumstances that will pertain if they exercise the powers conferred on them by this clause?
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para5"></a>We have received some representations on this point from the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association and others who were concerned that there may be a deficiency in this respect. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to reassure the Committee on this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I start from the position that the amendment is unnecessary. I hope that I can give the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para6"></a>The power for escorts to search a detained person is contained in paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. That power must already be exercised in accordance with rules made by the Secretary of State regardless of the context in which the search is taking place.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para7"></a>Those rules are contained in the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (Statutory Instrument 238/2001). Specifically, Rule 7&#151;it applies equally to escorts as it does to staff in removal centres&#151;requires that detained persons shall be searched in as seemly a manner as is consistent with discovering anything concealed. It also requires that no detained person shall be stripped and searched in the sight of another detained person or in the sight of or presence of an officer or other person not of the same sex.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para8"></a> The amendment is properly put forward by the noble Lord acting on information put to him by practitioners. However, our contention is that it is an unnecessary duplication of an existing provision. In those terms, I believe that the noble Lord should feel  assured, and comfortable in withdrawing the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I do not want to repeat the Minister's reply in debate on a later amendment but did I hear him aright? Can the custody officer enter premises at present without the necessity for a search warrant signed by a responsible person?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think not; I think that the power is limited and that it can be exercised only when escorts are accompanying immigration or police officers to premises for which a warrant has been issued. I believe that that is the answer to the noble Lord's point but I shall seek further clarification and if I am wrong I shall write to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I listened carefully to the Minister's answer but I did not hear him address the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about the rules mentioned in paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 to the 1991 Act. That provision gives the detaining custody officer the power to conduct those searches. It also states that that has to be in accordance with rules made by the Secretary of State. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, therefore asked: where are the rules and have they yet been made? The understanding of the agencies was that they still had not been published; that was also my understanding. If the Minister can assure us that the rules exist, I hope that he will also give us a reference to them so that we can look them up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I see that those in the Box are nodding; I take it that the rules have been made and laid. If Members of the Committee want further clarification, I shall happily provide them with a note confirming the situation. Meanwhile, I believe that the answer is on its way over to me. The rules are in paragraph 13(2) of Schedule 2. They have been made. Rule 7 of the detention centre rules is the relevant provision. I referred to that earlier. Rule 7 applies equally to escorts as to staff in removal centres.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his response and clarification. I hope that he will allow me to go away and examine rule 7 in the light of what has been said in this short and extremely useful debate, and to come back, if necessary, on Report. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment deals with the proposal in Clause 56 to change the name of detention centres to "removal centres". That sounds to me suspiciously like a pre-judgment of the case. My amendment would change the name to "holding centre", a much more neutral and balanced title.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para15"></a>Amendment No. 170, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would provide that those centres were holding centres for people whom the Secretary of State was lawfully entitled to remove. That would achieve exactly the same effect as my amendment. If the Minister is prepared to accept either of those amendments, I am not going to be fussy about which it is; I should be content with either. However, if the Minister condemns both amendments, I will be reminded of the person who said, in the case of the impeachment of the Earl of Strafford, that it began to sound as if we would condemn him because we would condemn him. I hope that the Minister will agree to one of the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   As I understand it, the Government want detention centres to be called "removal centres" to make the point that detention may involve removal and that it is therefore better to give those centres that name even if they are still detention centres and will still detain people for purposes other than removal. The amendments of the official Opposition and of the Liberal Democrats neatly bracket the Government's position, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said. The Liberal Democrats approve of the Government's desire to change the name but they do so by involving both purposes, and the official Opposition's amendment acknowledges the Government's desire to introduce the concept of removal by making it the single purpose. As the noble Earl said, that is a very simple choice for the Government to make between the two amendments.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para16"></a>There is, within a mile of this place, a good test of the Government's logic. The Tate Gallery stands where Jeremy Bentham's Millbank penitentiary once stood. As one might expect of Bentham, it was in some senses a model prison and, indeed, a modern prison. The domestic arrangements in the cells were ones of which Stephen Tumim would have approved when he was Chief Inspector of Prisons. The penitentiary, which was adjacent to where prisoners took the tender to the larger ships that would transport them to Australia, was where they were held but the prisoners were not yet committed to going. On the eve of their being transported to Australia they were taken to cells on five floors below the Morpeth Arms&#151;a pub which still stands on Millbank&#151;and were held there. That would seem perfectly logical. The penitentiary might reasonably have been called the detention centre; the cells underneath the Morpeth Arms&#151;which I believe are still there&#151;could reasonably have been called a removal centre.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para17"></a>The Government's position, if I may say so, is straight out of Alice. It is Humpty Dumpty saying that he wants words to mean what he wants them to mean. If the Government regret that they were ever called detention centres, my recollection is that there is <P>


<a name="column_1079"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1079</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another censorious character in Alice&#151;perhaps the Caterpillar, perhaps the Red Queen, perhaps the Griffin, perhaps even Humpty Dumpty himself&#151;who would have said, "If you wanted to call them removal centres, then that is what you should have called them in the first place", and I wholly concur with the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   I strongly support the amendment. It is not simply a matter of clarifying terminology and purpose. I believe that this amendment goes right to the heart of what this Bill is all about and how we want it to be perceived.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para18"></a>On Second Reading we spent a certain amount of time discussing the distinction between administering necessary policy justly in this area and playing to a negative public opinion by suggesting that the purpose of the legislation was to get rid of all of these people who should not really be here. Some of us argued that, while people who have no grounds for being here have no grounds for being here and will have to be removed, the primary purpose of the Bill is to ensure that all those with any entitlement to be here are able to stay. That is what the Bill is about.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para19"></a>As soon as we introduce the word "removal" into clauses such as this, whether or not the Government intend it, the message becomes confused. It panders to the irresponsible media and the rest, who want to talk in hysterical terms about the need to remove people rather than talk about our responsibility as a nation for ensuring that those who are entitled to be here are able to be here, while dealing sensitively but firmly with those who are not.
<P>

<a name="20715-25_para20"></a>I believe that there is a great deal more to this amendment&#151;if the noble Earl will forgive me on this occasion, because it is most unusual&#151;than even he suggested. I believe that he was too modest. While there was something to commend the terminology of the Official Opposition, I think that his own term is a better one and I wish that he would stand more firmly by it.

It was felt that this might be an assistance to the delicate process which, even in my distant days, was in train. It is perhaps a precedent to be looked at.

<a name="20715-26_para0"></a>The serious point is that one or other amendment&#151;preferably the second&#151;needs to be accepted until such time as no people are detained who have not yet received their first decision in an asylum case or who have not yet exhausted their rights of appeal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   I follow the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and support the amendment. I have information from the Churches' Bail Circle that might be of interest to the Committee. There is evidence from the bail circle and from detention centre visiting groups that many asylum seekers are detained well before the end of the process of determining their claims, as my noble friend said&#151;either on arrival or before the determination of their appeal.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para1"></a> The bail circle worked with 257 asylum seekers last year and in the first quarter of this year. Full data concerning dates of arrival, asylum claim and detention were available for 102 of these, of whom 77 per cent were detained at or soon after arrival. The sample is small, but there is no reason to suppose that it is not representative. It surely bears out what the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I shall speak to my Amendment No. 170. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said that logically the Government ought to accept either his amendment or mine and that he is prepared to accept mine if need be. I also heard the noble Lord, Lord Judd, upbraid the noble Earl, Lord Russell, saying that he preferred the noble Earl's amendment to mine. As long as we get the right result, I shall not be pedantic about which wording is adopted. I would be equally happy to support the noble Earl's wording if we can achieve the right result.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para2"></a>I shall be fairly brief, as the arguments have been covered effectively. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the only people held in removal centres are those whom the Secretary of State is lawfully entitled to remove. That seems an obvious aim. As my honourable friend Mr Malins said on Report in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Detaining asylum seekers is a sensitive issue and detention should be used with the greatest sensitivity. Detaining persons whom the Secretary of State is not entitled to remove is an unhappy concept for many Opposition Members".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/6/02; cols. 872-73.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-26_para3"></a>We feel the same in this House.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para4"></a>I was grateful for the intervention of my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew and my noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, both of whom, in their succinct way, made it clear that the Government's position is untenable. As my noble friend Lord Brooke, said, the Government's words seem like something from Alice in Wonderland.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para5"></a>Noble Lords have not followed through the question of the current designation of detention centres. I am told that the IND has already changed the name of detention centres to removal centres on letterheads and public signposts&#151;for example at Dungavel&#151;and on memorandums, even though the clause has not even been debated, let alone the Bill <P>


<a name="column_1081"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1081</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enacted. Can the Minister confirm whether the IND has made that change? If so, on whose authority was it done?
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para6"></a>Like other noble Lords, I should be very disappointed if the Minister felt unable to accept either the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, or mine. At this late hour I do not intend to pursue the matter, but I give notice that I shall pursue it later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Our purpose in renaming detention centres as removal centres is to reinforce the key role that detention plays in the removal of those who have no lawful basis to stay here. It does not signal a change of function for such centres. They will remain designated places of detention for the purposes of the Immigration Act. Similarly, it does not signal a change to the powers to detain. Our priority for the use of detention space is to support the removal of failed asylum seekers and others who have no basis of stay here, such as illegal entrants and overstayers.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para7"></a>Although we plan to increase the number of detention spaces to some 4,000, they will obviously remain a finite resource that must be focused on the area of greatest need&#151;that is, the removal of failed asylum seekers. That is a priority. But it will always be the case that removal centres will need to be used in other circumstances and at other points in the process where we have power to detain, particularly, for example, at Oakington. That is an integral part of effective immigration control which would be prevented by the amendment. I question whether noble Lords would wish that to happen.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para8"></a>Apart from detention to effect removal, including deportation, our current policy is that we may detain in both asylum and non-asylum cases while a person's identity or claim is established, or because a person is likely to abscond, or, in asylum cases only, as part of the fast-track case processing at Oakington reception centre. Again, that will continue to be the case despite the change of name to "removal centres". On that basis, it would be inappropriate to seek to restrict those who may be held at removal centres, as Amendment No. 170 seeks to do, to those,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whom the Secretary is lawfully entitled to remove".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-26_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20715-26_para10"></a>There are also practical difficulties with the amendment. A person whose removal was not for the time being lawful&#151;for example, a person with an outstanding asylum claim&#151;would therefore not be able to be detained in a removal centre, although they could be detained in short-term facilities or prisons. It would also prevent the detention in a removal centre of those who are removable, but the power to do so is vested in an immigration officer rather than the Secretary of State. That would apply to the majority of those refused leave to enter.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para11"></a>I know that there has been some concern that the change of name may lead to confusion among detainees, especially asylum seekers, who have yet to receive a decision on their application but are held at a removal centre. We simply do not accept that. All detainees receive a notice at the time of their detention that sets out clearly the reasons for that detention. <P>


<a name="column_1082"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1082</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, detainees should be under no illusion as to the reasons. In addition, detained asylum seekers will go through the induction process at the place of detention, and that will include information on the asylum process. Therefore, they will know that they will not be removed while their claim is outstanding. I have set out why we decided to adopt the name "removal centre", and I do not consider that "holding centre" is a better alternative.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para12"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, made the point that, within the context of Northern Ireland, there were holding centres for those held pending the further determination of their situation. I am not sure that that necessarily helps the argument for the amendments offered by some Members of the Committee this evening. Surely that could create confusion in some minds as to the purpose of the centres. The comparison with centres used to hold suspected terrorists would be an unenviable parallel. I wonder whether that is as wise a move as some in the Committee might like to argue. I believe that, in the context of immigration and asylum cases, it is not a matter to which we should give serious consideration. Having heard those arguments and points, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I hope that he will accept that in relation to this amendment some of us&#151;I am fairly certain that I shall not be alone&#151;feel that, while he has tried hard to argue the case, he has not convinced us. I ask him again to think himself into the position of people in the centres and, indeed, of many irresponsible people in the media and elsewhere in this country. Some are determined to suggest that we should remove everyone it is possible to remove. Inevitably, that view will become an acute anxiety on the part of people in the centres.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para13"></a>I understood my noble friends to say repeatedly in the deliberations on this Bill that they are committed to getting the right result in each case. Why throw away that flag of commitment to getting the right result by the injudicious and loose use of the word, "removal"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Before I reply, perhaps the Minister will reply to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. Is it true that the name of some centres has already been changed to "removal centre" before the approval of Parliament has been given? Can he answer that before I reply?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am happy to answer. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked a perfectly proper question. The answer is yes; the change was made on the direction of the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para14"></a> To pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord Judd, we are committed to ensuring that people who come into this country, albeit illegally, claiming asylum and refuge are treated humanely, decently and properly, and in accordance with the principles of natural justice and law. In renaming detention centres we are seeking to reinforce the key role that detention <P>


<a name="column_1083"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column 1083</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plays in the removal of those who have no lawful base on which to stay here. It does not, of itself, signal a change of function for the centres. It underlines the important role that they play in the range of facilities, the range of strategies, that we seek to employ to manage and handle the situation.
<P>

<a name="20715-26_para15"></a>The problems that confront us are serious and we take them seriously. We believe in fair and proper treatment. We are a government that have demonstrated that not just in this field of legislation, but in many others. Our record and reputation are second to none in that regard. Therefore I insist that the amendment is unnecessary and should be withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-27_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am grateful for the support I received from the Committee for either my amendment or that in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I particularly enjoyed listening to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville. But I could not help thinking what would happen if that process were repeated now, when the people shipped out from Millbank arrived in Australia. It would be a pretty kettle of fish. All the same I cannot help thinking that the noble Lord reached the wrong quotation from Alice. Begging his pardon, the one we wanted was, "Verdict first. Trial afterwards". The noble Lord, Lord Judd, was right about that.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made the point that the name, "removal centres", cannot be justified while they hold people whose claims have not yet been determined or who have not yet exhausted their right of appeal. It completely prejudges the question. In my <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>view it is a contempt of the courts. As for the change of name on the Home Secretary's authority, that is, in my view, a contempt of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para1"></a>I was always brought up to believe that Parliament made the law. Of course, I have been here long enough to know that that principle is honoured as much in the breach as in the observance, but on this occasion it has not even been honoured in the breach. I take that deeply amiss. I agree with my noble friend Lord Avebury: in that case what is the purpose of the clause? Why not delete it altogether if we do not need it? If we do not make the law, what are we all doing sitting here at this time of night pretending that we are trying to change matters that are being altered without so much as a by your leave from any noble Lord?
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para2"></a>It is absolutely vital that justice should not only be done, but should be seen to be done. That means that when people's claims for asylum come up for hearing they should believe that whether their claims are successful depends on the evidence that they offer and the legal justice of their case. If people are put straight into places that are labelled removal centres, that argument cannot be made. One cannot claim to be conducting impartial justice because one has announced to the world at large, in capital letters and printed on signs, that one is doing no such thing. Perhaps that announcement is not accurate, but in that case it was unwise to make it.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para3"></a>I believe that this is the most unsatisfactory reply that I have heard in Parliament for a good many years. I understand that the Minister offers us good intentions. I believe him, but he sounds remarkably like a servant brandishing an open testimonial that says, "During his period of service with me, Mr So-and-So has discharged his duties entirely to his own satisfaction". He has not discharged them to our satisfaction. I hope that before Report stage we shall see a government amendment so that we shall not have to put our own amendment to a Division. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20715-27_para9"></a>Clause 55 [Information to be kept about a person's adoption]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-27_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 80:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 33, line 2, at end insert "which shall include all the information necessary to fulfil the duty imposed by virtue of section (Disclosure of information regarding a person's adoption)(2)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-27_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: I rising to move Amendment No. 80, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 81. These amendments deal with a fundamental human right; the right for an adoptive person to be told, before entering adulthood, that he or she is adopted. Most adoptees will of course already be well aware of their adopted status, long before they reach the age of 18. Many will have been adopted at an age when they knew exactly what was happening to them. However, there will still be many who will have been adopted as babies. They will have no knowledge of their origins unless they are told about them when they are old enough to understand.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para11"></a>Adoptive parents, if they are sensitive and caring, will in the majority of cases take it upon themselves to disclose this information to the child in a sensitive way at what seems to them an appropriate moment. There are ways in which this can be done that minimise the risk of angst or trauma in the child. However, we need to ask what should happen when that does not take place; when a child becomes an adult and, for whatever reason, continues to be unaware of his or her background.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para12"></a>There are two main reasons for concern here. The first is that for an individual to discover accidentally, as an adult&#151;possibly even when well into adulthood&#151;that he was adopted and that the two people he had previously regarded as his genetic parents were not his genetic parents is one of the most shattering experiences it is possible to imagine, short of bereavement. We should not allow for the risk of it happening. The second consideration is very practical: unless someone knows that he or she was adopted, it will be impossible to guard against the possibility of incestuous contact with siblings who, unknown to them, may have been brought up in the same area.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para13"></a>While I am instinctively reluctant to impose further duties on the state, I see little alternative but to do so in this particular context. It should be up to the public authorities, purely as a longstop and failing all other safeguards, to fulfil this duty of care to adopted individuals. I say that because the state has created that individual's status as an adopted person; the state, therefore, has a duty towards him. It is as simple as that.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para14"></a>I am well aware that such a duty implies the need to monitor the individual's whereabouts until the age of 18 and I fully admit that this would create additional administrative burdens, but the burdens are necessary. It should not be beyond the wit of officials to come up with a methodology that does not involve a huge bureaucratic apparatus in order to maintain the relevant records. To a large extent, the records will be maintained anyway. It is simply a question of keeping track of an adult till his 18th birthday, which is not a particularly onerous requirement in itself.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to this amendment and to the other in this group. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-27_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  First, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for raising what I agree is a very important issue. However, I feel that his solution may take us down some rather difficult paths, one or two of which he alluded to as regards the practicality of ensuring that what he proposes in the amendment takes place and about extending an element of state intrusion. That is a particularly difficult issue when we come to look at the issue of human rights in relation to the child and to the respect for private and family life. There are some difficult issues here which need to be considered.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para16"></a>As regards the existing provision, there is provision for the disclosure of information to adopted people and their birth relatives under existing legislation. Adopted adults have the right to access a certified copy of the record of their birth from the Registrar General, which will contain the names of their birth parents and their address at the time the record was made. Over and above that, regulations give adoption agencies a discretionary power to disclose information, including identifying information to adopted adults and their birth relatives. The courts may also exercise their discretion in disclosing information from their records of adoption cases. Adoption agencies have a wide discretion, therefore, under current legislation to disclose information.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para17"></a>While I readily accept that current practice is variable. The adoption law review and the adoption White Paper published in December 2000 found there were wide variations. In some cases, agencies had passed on sensitive identifying information without consulting the person who would be identified. We propose to address these issues in two ways: first, for future adoptions, setting out a clearer framework in primary legislation; and, secondly, by taking a number <P>


<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of steps to ensure that for past adoptions agency practice is improved, made more consistent and more sensitive.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para18"></a>We want people to have greater access to better means to deal with the exchange of this information which, given the circumstances of past adoptions, may be particularly sensitive. We want to do this in a way that recognises the practical differences between legislation for future adoptions in the context of a comprehensively regulated adoption system and past adoptions that may have happened in very different circumstances with, or indeed without, the involvement of an adoption agency and in the context of little regulation and poor records.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para19"></a>The provisions in the Bill give a systematic and clear  process in primary legislation for future adoptions for taking forward an application for identifying information held in their records. For example, where an agency decides to process an application seeking identifying information about an adult, it will have a duty to take reasonable steps to seek the views of the person who would be identified. The adoption agency may disclose the identifying information having regard to all the circumstances, prescribed matters, any express use for the person the information is about and the adopted person's welfare.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para20"></a>As regards what I might describe as pre-Bill adoptions in a later group of amendments, I will explain the measures we are taking to help achieve the same results, while recognising some of the practical issues alluded to by the noble Earl that arise to the different contexts of these adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para21"></a>As regards the specific amendments, Amendment No. 81 would place a duty on an adoption agency to inform the adopted person of his adoption. It also allows regulations to be made which could set out the method by which the agency carries out this duty, and provides that the duty would not apply to certain groups of adopted people. As the adopted child becomes by law the child of the adoptive parents, the agency has no further role after the time of the adoption order, except in so far as there is an agreement for ongoing support or the family initiates the agency's involvement by requesting support. The fact that the state has facilitated the adoptive family does not reduce the privacy that the family is entitled to expect. Although nowadays the vast majority of adopted people will know about their adoption, the agency cannot be certain unless it has had recent contact with the family. In almost every case the adoption agency would have to contact the family. Adoption agencies may find themselves in a position where they are unable to fulfil this duty, for example where the adopted person cannot be found or where compliance with the duty would constitute a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para22"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggested, there is probably not a large number of adult individuals who do not know of their adoption. They will probably have been very young when they were adopted and they will probably be the most difficult to trace. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, thought that it would be perfectly possible <P>


<a name="column_GC280"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for my officials to come up with a straightforward, streamlined scheme of administration. I am afraid that that is not normally the noble Earl's view. In this case, however, the noble Earl has every confidence in the department being able to do that.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para23"></a>However, one cannot just pass over some of the administrative difficulties, even with the skill and expertise of my own department at the helm. In these cases, the agency will be seeking to contact the adopted person some 15 to 17 years after the adoption and the records the agency holds are likely to be out of date. I am informed that the average family moves home every seven years. The other practical issue here is that trying to keep track of adoptive families could be an intrusion as agencies would need to contact them to confirm their address or ask them to notify the agency of their home moves. It could also place a significant administrative burden on adoption agencies&#151;and we will come to that problem in a later group of amendments on information&#151;thus drawing away a significant proportion of their workforce and resources from the primary aim of arranging and supporting adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para24"></a>Where an adopted person or his family are not currently in touch with the agency, we would also have to face up to the fact that they may be reluctant to meet with it, or indeed alarmed by the initial approach. Where the adopters have not informed their child of the adoption, some of them may then do so, prompted by the inquiries made by the agency. Others, however, may attempt to obstruct access to the adopted person if he or she is living with them, or to refuse to pass on details of where he or she is now living. If the agency is able to meet with the adopted person, the probability is that the agency will be informing him of something he already knows. Where he does not, it could well come as a shock to those who have been living under the impression that their adopters were their natural parents. For those who learn of this information other than from adopters, the experience could well be distressing. The approach may also have consequences for the family unit as a whole, and in particular the adopted person's siblings. In some cases these siblings may themselves be adopted but as yet be too young to be informed by the agency.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para25"></a>We have consulted the Association of Directors of Social Services on this issue. They are concerned that in a few cases where the adopted person is particularly vulnerable he could be put at risk by the agency's intervention in his relationship with his adopters, for example where he is suffering from mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para26"></a>I say to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that I have no doubt that the adopted person should be informed of his or her adoption. The essential questions are who should inform the adopted person, and how and when it should happen. Most people would agree that the adoptive parents are best placed to inform their child of his or her origins and background. One has to rely on their good judgment to know when the time is right for that child. As the legal parents of the child, the adopters are responsible for the child's welfare and with their knowledge they should be best equipped to explain these facts to the adopted person. However, we need to ensure <P>


<a name="column_GC281"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as far as possible that adopters understand that part of their responsibility to their child is to inform him at the appropriate time of his adoption.
<P>

<a name="20715-27_para27"></a>In the light of the amendments and the substantive point put forward by the noble Earl, and&#151;I hope that he will accept this&#151;the practical difficulties they pose, we believe that the best way forward is to formalise a commitment by prospective adopters to be open with their child about his adoption. Therefore, we propose that, as part of the assessment process, prospective adopters would be asked to sign a formal commitment to inform their adopted child of his adoption before he reaches the age of 18. We intend to require adoption agencies to ensure that this is part of the assessment and recommendation process for adopters, using the general regulation-making power under Clause 9 of the Bill. We shall support this with clear guidance to adoption agencies. We have also discussed this matter with the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. They agree that the proposal I have outlined is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The best approach, given the practical difficulties of requiring the adoption agency to inform the adopted person of his adoption".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-27_para28"></a><P>

<a name="20715-27_para29"></a>This formal commitment would also be submitted to the court as part of the papers that accompany the adoption application. Although the written commitment would not be legally binding, it would reinforce the importance of the adopters informing their adopted child, especially when combined with the advice they will receive and the support available from the adoption agency. I hope that the noble Earl will consider that I have gone as far as I can in terms of the practical difficulties that I envisage with his amendments. However, I hope that he will recognise that he has raised an important matter.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Will the Minister tell the Committee what will happen if this formal commitment, which is not legally binding, is not honoured? Surely the spirit of my noble friend's amendments, which I wholly support, has to come into play. That has to be considered. I am not suggesting that, as drafted, Amendments Nos. 80 or 81 are, of necessity, totally correct. In Amendment No. 80, "all" creates tremendous difficulties as regards the European Convention on Human Rights. I shall not take a lot of time but I merely wish to indicate some of the points.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para0"></a>On Amendment No. 81, which, again, I support in principle, one would have to introduce&#151;would one not?&#151;some sort of safeguard that the regulations would require the best endeavours to discharge&#151;something of that kind. I am not here to seek to indulge in drafting, only to support my noble friend, in principle, on both amendments. I respectfully ask the Minister to give further consideration to this before the next stage of the proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I confess that I am rather horrified. The age of 18 is far too late to tell an adopted person that he has been adopted. I believe that the shock would be very great. The shock would be very great even at a much younger age. There will always be a shock unless one is brought up from the time one can speak <P>


<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and understand to know that one has been adopted. That ought to be part of what an adopting couple are told at the time of assessment. However, by the time a child is eight, nine, 10 or 11, let alone 18, he or she will be very shocked. I know that I would have been if someone had told me that I was adopted. If it is not done in very early childhood, if possible it should not be done at all. I am not interested in the danger of incest. I am sure that incest has been taking place down the centuries without anyone ever knowing about it. There are times when it is better that it happens and nobody knows about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   One should always be wary of talking about incest, particularly in your Lordships' House. I realise that I am now in deep trouble, from which I shall try rapidly to extricate myself.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para1"></a>I believe that the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, put her finger on the problem. That is why I sympathise with the principle enunciated by the noble Earl; namely, that adopted children should be informed. However, if we were to accept either the amendment or the principle behind it, we could end up with the kind of situation that the noble Lady described. This is why I am not at all convinced that the route down which we should go is by way of the amendments, or the principle that it seeks to put forward.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para2"></a>Nor am I particularly convinced that any written commitment given at the adopter-approval stage should be legally binding. One has only to imagine the circumstances in which such parents could be taken to court; indeed, the adopted child would have to experience his adoptive parents being taken to court for not informing him that he had been adopted. I believe that one should think very carefully before one went down that path.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para3"></a>We also need to recognise, first, that it is good practice to tell the child; and, secondly, that the culture has changed in adoptions. Surely, it is very unlikely that adoptive parents who now put themselves forward for consideration would be able to avoid this. The attitude of the potential adoptive parents to telling the child would be one of the factors that would help the agency come to a view as to whether such people were worthy of being considered for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para4"></a>As regards the issue of incest raised by the noble Earl, I would draw his attention to Clause 78(7), which provides for the registrar-general to inform an adopted person, on application to him, whether or not it appears from the register, and other records, that the applicant and the person he intends to marry are related. I hope that that goes some way towards meeting the noble Earl's point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-28_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his extremely considered and thoughtful reply. I am pleased that he regards this as a genuine issue. I certainly believe it to be so. The question I ask myself is this: which is worse in terms of human rights, an intrusion into someone's private life, or to allow for the possibility that someone could grow up ignorant of his origins?
<P>


<a name="column_GC283"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para5"></a>I believe that the Minister has implicitly acknowledged the importance of someone being made aware, in some fashion, of the fact that he has been adopted. I should add immediately that I accept the force of the points that he made about practical difficulties. Obviously, such points went through my mind as I thought about this matter. There is no perfect answer to this problem. I realise that the BAAF, which has immense experience in this field, will have thought about this very carefully. I must take on board its response to the Minister's approach on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para6"></a>I agree with the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, that 18 is too late to be told that you are adopted. In the normal course of events, as I said, one would expect a young person to have been told long since that he or she had been adopted. I was seeking merely to establish some sort of longstop answer to this. I do not agree with her that ignorance is bliss; there is a genuine right for someone to know about his origins and the later it gets in someone's life, the worse it is.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para7"></a>Nevertheless, I shall read and reflect carefully on the Minister's comments, for which I thank him. I shall consult on the matter and consider whether or not it is necessary to bring it back on Report. I somehow doubt that it is in the light of what he has said but in the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20715-28_para14"></a><P>

"( ) This section shall apply to all adopted persons, whether adopted before or after the coming into force of this Act."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-28_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 82 and to speak also to Amendments Nos. 82A and 85. These amendments take us to the important issue of retrospection, which is a subject highlighted by several of the organisations with an interest in adoption, in particular the Children's Society and NORCAP.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para16"></a>These amendments are particularly important because of the repeal in this Bill of the Adoption Act 1976, which currently in Section 50(5) allows the High Court to release information. This provision is narrow but did, for example, facilitate the recent reunion of triplets born in 1932. Clause 78(4) allows the provision of information about people adopted before this Bill but only in exceptional circumstances and Clause 78(4) is considerably narrower than Section 50(5), which was itself narrow. Thus, the problem of getting information about past adoptions will become even more difficult once this Bill is passed.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para17"></a>I do not need to rehearse the history of adoption. The stigma of illegitimacy often resulted in massive pressures on mothers to let their children be adopted with no further provision for contact. Many lived to regret that <P>


<a name="column_GC284"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and I am sure that Members of the Committee have heard of or know those whose lives have been blighted by the loss of a child through virtually enforced adoption.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para18"></a>Since 1975, adopted adults have been able to obtain their birth records and thus start the process of searching for their birth parents and more than 70,000 have already done so. However, that is one-way traffic; it does not allow for the birth family to start to search for their lost child. This Bill puts right the anomaly for new adoptions and will allow birth relatives to apply for information about a family member who has been adopted. As such, it is welcome, but it does not go anything like far enough and will have no practical impact for many years to come. There is no logic to refusing the facility for previous adoptions. Indeed, it is in that area that the need is greatest, given the unenlightened approach to illegitimacy and adoption in the past. There are a couple of generations of parents&#151;mostly but not only mothers&#151;who desperately need to try to contact the child whom they lost.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para19"></a>Amendment No. 82 inserts a new subsection into Clause 60, which allows people to apply for protected information about adopted adults, giving retrospective effect to the clause. When this amendment was considered in Committee in another place, the Government made much of the practical difficulties which would result from giving retrospective effect to Clause 60. In the light of that, Amendment No. 85 is put forward as a different approach. Amendment No. 85 amends Clause 78, which deals with the adoption register.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para20"></a>Amendment No. 85 puts four new subsections into Clause 78. The first requires the registrar-general to maintain and make available a list of adoption support agencies to provide intermediary support services between adopted persons and birth relatives, all of course subject to regulation. It does not require the registrar-general to vet the agencies, simply to maintain the list. The third subsection makes it clear that the registrar-general has no responsibility for the intermediary services provided. The amendment therefore does not place a particular burden on the registrar-general.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para21"></a>The meat of it is in the second subsection which requires the registrar-general to provide information held by him on adoptions before 1975, so that the agency can obtain a certified copy of the adoption entry. The consent of the adopted person is important, as the fourth new subsection makes clear.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para22"></a>The amendment, which has been drafted by NORCAP and the Children's Society, overcomes all the practical difficulties raised by the Minister in another place to the equivalent amendment to Amendment No. 82. In particular, the problem of incomplete records in adoption agencies and local authorities will not be a problem. The registrar-general has a complete record of adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para23"></a>The adoption support agencies will take the burden and hence will not drain resources away from adoption agencies which can continue to prioritise their work on to the important task of getting more children adopted.

<P>

<a name="20715-28_para24"></a>The Minister in another place said that there would be too much demand for this information. However, provided that the demand can be satisfied without impact on today's adoptions, I believe that that argues for the amendment and not against it.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para25"></a>It may well be difficult to trace people, but today's technology provides new opportunities for search, and making the information from the adoption register available gives people the chance to search.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para26"></a>I should point out that the amendment does not apply to adoptions between 1975 and the appointed day under this Bill. It applies only to adoptions before 1975. It is not therefore wholly logical as there will be no information provision for birth relatives of persons adopted between 1975 and some time in 2002. That is something on which we may want to reflect further before the next stage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para27"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 82A is very specific about the ability of siblings to obtain information about their adult adopted siblings. This has full retrospective effect back to the start of legal adoptions in 1926. Under the amendment, an adoption agency would obtain information from the registrar-general under Clause 78, and there are the usual safeguards for the views of the adopted adult or, indeed, the involvement of the High Court authorising the agency not to disclose in appropriate circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para28"></a>This is designed to help people trace their long-lost adopted brothers and sisters, who have been separated by adoption. I spoke earlier about adoptions under a different social climate where there was de facto an endorsed solution separating children from their mothers. However, there were often some innocent bystanders in that process; there were children either then existing or children who came later in a subsequent union. In all those cases, the emotional needs of siblings, who were innocent as far as the adoption was concerned, can be as important as those of the mother.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para29"></a>The Minister may well try to beguile us with plans to promote the adoption contact register, and bolster intermediary support services. I thank his office for sending me a copy of a letter from the department of 10th July which sets out the Government's plans. Those ideas, which are indeed welcome, will not replace a right for birth relatives to obtain information about adopted persons.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para30"></a>All of these amendments in different ways deal with the needs of the families affected by adoptions in the past. We should not ignore the pain that still exists today for people affected by those adoptions. I welcome the Bill for its prospective effect but do not believe it would be responsible for this House to lose this opportunity to give hundreds or thousands of individuals a last chance to connect their past or their present. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20715-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   During Second Reading I spoke of how other parts of the Bill had been picked up in the press as very important and I did not think that they were. However, I believe that this is one of the most important parts of the Bill. The key reason for that is timing, and I shall come back to timing at the end of my <P>


<a name="column_GC286"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remarks. I wish to deal with three particular points primarily in relation to Amendment No. 85: first, why searches should go via the registrar-general; secondly, why siblings should be included in this; and, thirdly, why regulations are simply insufficient in this matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para31"></a>The first and most important point to make is that the matter needs to go via the registrar-general because that is the only place where complete records exist. Adoption agency records are incomplete and, indeed, a very high percentage of the adoptions we are talking about were private adoptions. It was were perfectly legal until 1975 for there to be private adoptions, and many of them were, so there are no records. The Minister will probably argue that it is not unlawful now for birth parents to make searches, and indeed they do primarily via the Children's Society. It is not unlawful, it is just extremely difficult because it is extremely difficult to get the correct information.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para32"></a>I wish to echo the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about the statements made by the Minister in another place, Miss Jacqui Smith. In Hansard of 16th May 2002 at cols. 1016 to 1020, she eloquently set out the reasons why this will not happen; this will not be a priority if it is left to regulation. She, too, referred to the fact that information was not comprehensive, that many adoptions were private, and that the matter will not be given any priority when most adoption agencies will now quite rightly be consumed with the arrangement of new adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para33"></a>I have to make an additional point&#151;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that legislation is not retrospective unless it is expressly so. As far as I understand it, there is no retrospection in the Bill. Perhaps he can guide me on that.
<P>

<a name="20715-28_para34"></a>I suspect the Minister will tell us that guidance is forthcoming and I thank his department for sharing with us the letter of 10th July. I notice that the letter of 10th July has a cut-off date for response of 26th July. As far as the Department of Health regulations on this sort of thing go, that is quite a long time. On the intercountry adoption Act regulations, his department surpassed itself by issuing a document on Maundy Thursday with a return date of the following Tuesday and not setting out any of the organisations&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Baroness will be pleased to know that that is all part of our streamlined process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   It is interesting to know what the Minister thinks we should all do over the Easter weekend. That is a very quick turnround. The more serious point is that there is a history going back to the Second World War of regulations being promised on this subject and not happening. That has been the case for the past decade in particular. The letter from the Department of Health talks about encouraging the wider provision of intermediary services. It does not talk about requiring there to be higher quality intermediary services. It is all couched in extremely tentative language.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para0"></a>In the face of the other pressures on adoption, about which we have spoken throughout the passage of this Bill, there is no reason to believe that this will be any <P>


<a name="column_GC287"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more of a priority. In fact, in following recent consultations, I gather that some local authorities which used to provide this service have stopped doing so and indeed, only 50 per cent of authorities in England operate an intermediary service. When local government re-organisation hits and unitary authorities come into play, there is every reason to believe that that percentage will go down.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para1"></a>Much is made of what the department's intentions are. It is important to note that the document we were given last month, Providing Effective Adoption Support, does not mention birth parents. Yet again, they fell off the agenda, as they always have done.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para2"></a>In 1976, when this country took the bold step of introducing the measures which enabled adopted people to search for their parents, we led the way in the world. There was a great deal of trepidation at that time about what might happen and the potential disappointment and hurt to individuals. Except in&#151;so far as I know&#151;one case, that has been an unqualified success, so much so that other countries in the world followed our lead. Now, however, we find ourselves trailing yet again because Canada, New Zealand and Australia have retrospective legislation for birth parents while we do not. It is difficult to see why not.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para3"></a>On the issue of siblings, I wanted to thank a Mr Robin Harritt, a correspondent who has written to a number of noble Lords. He has set out for us his difficulties in trying to trace his seven siblings, all of whom were adopted. I, too, must disagree with the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy. Perhaps I might take a different view and say that if one knew that one was committing incest, that might be a different matter, but when it happens and you do not know, that is wholly wrong. It is actually wrong in both cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   What I meant was not knowing and never knowing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I see the point the noble Lady was making, but I still believe it is better that individuals have clear knowledge about who they are and who their relatives are.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para4"></a>A great deal will be made about the potential cost and the numbers of people involved&#151;I shall return to the question of costs shortly. In my researches on this subject, I have been trying to determine what the potential scale of the problem will be. The Library has provided me with the list of annual adoptions, which total 867,355 since 1927. There was clear bunching from 1945 to 1949, at the end of the War, and from 1964 to 1975. In another place, it has been argued that 867,000 will mean a huge burden.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para5"></a>However, it is important to point out that in this country in any year, approximately one-third to one-half of all adoptions are step-parent adoptions. Secondly, since 1975, most adoptions have been of children from public care and those children have gone into adoption with a great deal of knowledge about their families of origin.
<P>


<a name="column_GC288"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para6"></a>Another interesting fact is that until 1950 adoptions were not private. Serial numbers started to be used only in 1950. Prior to that, an adoption application to a court was by a named couple to adopt a named child from a named person. To some extent, therefore, we are beginning to whittle down that total figures of 867,000, which is an absolute figure.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para7"></a>We then come back to the issue of cost. Having spoken to some of those involved in the issue, I know that they would pay anything for this information. This information means more than anything else to them. A system such as that proposed in these amendments which operated via the registrar-general would be more direct and more effective. It would allow people to spend much less time than they do now in chasing insubstantial leads and half-remembered records. They would be able to go straight to the necessary information.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para8"></a>As we discussed on Second Reading, whatever action we take will come with no promises of success for the individual. I think that those affected by this matter understand that, in proposing this amendment, noble Lords are not guaranteeing success at all. However, I have come to the conclusion that some of the arguments put forward so far by the department are rather hollow, particularly those in relation to cost. The department's arguments about raising people's hopes ring particularly hollow. These people's hopes have been raised and dashed for years. For years on end they have been promised regulations, but those regulations have simply not materialised.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para9"></a>I hope that the Minister will indicate his willingness to include in the Bill these provisions tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and my noble friend Lady Barker have made an incontestable, rational argument for this group of amendments. Unashamedly, however, I shall briefly make a strong emotional case for the amendments. We must not lose sight of the fact that there is a necessity to legislate, and legislate now, for an entire generation of birth parents. If we do not legislate now, we shall miss an opportunity. As we know, adoption and children legislation of this kind comes but once in a generation.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para10"></a>In addressing this issue, I should like to cite two letters I have received which outline two case studies that have affected me deeply. I think that we have all received a lot of correspondence on the Bill. Emotionally, however, the retrospection issue has touched me more than any other aspect of the Bill. I shall start by reading out a letter from an 80 year-old correspondent, a birth mother who gave up her child for adoption many years ago, in the late 1940s, I think. She writes:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I expect that many mothers like me held themselves together with the secret belief that one day the baby, now adult, would search for and find them. This dream of eventual reunion totally ignored the knowledge on the mother's part that the law had been expressly designed to make this impossible but in your dreams anything may happen. In my case, and many other women, of whom I have met quite a few, that dream could never come true. It took me 12 years of searching and importuning to be given the information that my daughter had died in 1958, aged 11. At that stage, I was 76 and my daughter would have been 51. Even then I was not allowed to know <P>

These factors cumulatively must account for my receipt, anonymously, of the information needed to get in touch via an intermediary with the remaining family of my daughter who welcomed me with both sadness and joy. We remain in contact.

The message says, 'I am here, I have always loved you and I want contact, if you choose it and in whatever way you choose'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-29_para13"></a>It is a very moving letter.
<P>

<a name="20715-29_para14"></a>The issue of siblings is also extremely important, and adopted siblings have found huge difficulties as well. I was very touched by another letter from somebody who discovered that they had a brother. The letter states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A few years ago I discovered that I have a brother. He was born in 1945 to my then unmarried mother. She nursed him for seven months then put him up for fostering. It was after the death of my father that a distant relative told me, an only child, that I might have a brother or sister.

The next stage was to register my interest with both the adoption register at"&#151;Y&#151;"and with NORCAP . . . Now I have to wait and wait and wait until a 57-year-old man discovers that he is adopted and may be interested enough to register his name on the corresponding page of the register.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-29_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20715-29_para19"></a>I think that those two letters, very movingly, speak for themselves.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I should like first to pay tribute to the contributions that have been made&#151;both, in a sense, to the rational and to the emotional, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, put it. I, too, have read some of the stories of those who have tried to discover their adopted children, and stories of adopted children who have attempted to discover their birth parents. They are very moving indeed. I hope that, in my response to these amendments, noble Lords will not underestimate my sympathy for the points made in this debate.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para0"></a>Equally, I have to bear in mind the practical implications of what is being proposed. We have to recognise that&#151;in reforming the adoption law, and in reforming the practice of local authorities, adoption agencies and all those involved in adoption&#151;we seek to put in place a much enhanced service which will require tremendous effort on the part of all those involved. The balance of the argument essentially rests on the Government's concern that the kind of duties proposed <P>


<a name="column_GC290"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the amendments would impose such great duties on the agencies concerned that they could put at risk the ability of those agencies to focus on the essential task of improving current and future arrangements for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, very ingeniously tried to peel off some considerable figures from the 875,000&#151;an approximate figure&#151;adoptions that have taken place since passage of the Adoption of Children Act 1926. She made the point that many of those adoptions relate to step parents. I am happy, between now and Report, to look at those figures and to discuss them with her. Ultimately, however, I suspect we will still be left with potentially thousands of&#151;

<A NAME="20715-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I shall take up the Minister's generous offer. With the powers at his disposal, perhaps he will be able to discover the answer to a question that I have not been able to find. I have sought via the Library to obtain an estimate from the Government Actuary's department of how many of the parents in those cases would still be alive. I have been unsuccessful thus far, but, with the might of his department, the noble Lord may be able to find the answer.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I have some doubts in that respect. However, I shall see whether we can discover what figures are available. I would be happy to discuss the matter with the noble Baroness. At the end of the day, we can have a most interesting and perhaps somewhat academic argument about the numbers involved, but it does not take us away from some of the practical issues that we would face. As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, acknowledged, with many of the adoptions being arranged privately there are often very few records, other than a report about placement, which the adoption agency may or may not hold. Before 1984, we know that the obligations on adoption agencies to keep and record information were not as comprehensive as they are now. Many records exist in part, while others have been lost.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para2"></a>If details of an individual are found on the case file in relation to an adoption that was made many years ago, there would then be the practical difficulty of trying to trace that person to seek his views about the disclosure of information. As is clear from the terms of the amendment, this would be a considerable burden on the agencies. This is where we come to the difficulty, the argument, about priorities. Although the Government are sympathetic to why these proposals are being put forward, we are concerned that we focus not just  resources&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned resources, and of course resources is always an important matter. Indeed, it is not just resources; it is also the use of skilled staff, time and energy, and the right sort of focus. We have already had a riveting debate about adoption support. That is an area in which Members of the Committee are urging the Government to do everything possible to ensure that the proper adoption support is given after assessment. That is why we are concerned about the full impact of the proposed amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_GC291"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para3"></a>I want to acknowledge the force of the argument being put forward. The Government are listening very carefully to the comments that have been made. Adoption agencies have discretion to disclose information, and the provisions in the Bill do not remove that discretion. The Bill provides a framework within which the agency may exercise its discretion. We obviously need to assess the impact of that on future practice in relation to current arrangements. We will be issuing guidance later this year to adoption agencies to help ensure that practice is more consistent. We will advise agencies to take a more positive approach to the disclosure of information and encourage them to base their practice on the Bill's provisions. We envisage intermediary services, which are available in some parts of the country, as being able to provide sensitive support and counselling to those seeking to make contact with a relative, thereby sharing some of the work that might otherwise fall on adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para4"></a>When it comes to the promotion of best practice, we have also made it clear that we will expect those agencies to adopt the principles of best practice. I accept that there are issues relating to the current patchy provision of services, and the kind of difficulties which noble Lords have mentioned regarding people seeking to find information. We shall be consulting shortly with adoption stakeholders on the operation of the scheme. This will follow with a selection process in relation to the services that can be provided for one leading provider to act as a resource for adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para5"></a>The adoption contact register facilitates contact between adopted persons and their birth relatives where both parties have expressed a wish for such contact. However, the majority of adopted people and their birth relatives do not even know that it exists. There have been only two brief attempts to promote the register since its establishment in 1991. We see that a more pro-active and frequent promotion of the register through adoption agencies and key stakeholders would raise its profile and encourage more people to use it. We are looking at ways to achieve this and we will be consulting adoption stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para6"></a>Amendment No. 82A is directed at the linking information maintained and safeguarded by the registrar-general. The linking information forms a bridge between a person's adoption record and his birth record. It is needed so that when an adopted person applies for his birth certificate and he does not know his birth name, the registrar-general will be able to use the linking information to find the birth name. This would then be given to the adopted adult so that he may exercise his right to obtain his birth certificate.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para7"></a>While the amendment does not open up the linking information to public inspection, it would appear to mark a shift in the way the information is safeguarded by current law and would be protected under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para8"></a>There appear to be two intentions behind the new clause. The first is to allow applications to be made to the adoption agency in respect of those adopted since 1976. The second is to replace the provisions in the Bill which build on both the Adoption Act 1976 and the <P>


<a name="column_GC292"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1996 Appeal Court case. It would allow the adult birth sibling of an adopted adult to have a right to make an application to an adoption agency to obtain the linking information from the registrar-general. This amendment is based on the presumption that the confidential linking information is to be disclosed to the adopted person's birth sibling. It places a duty on the adoption agency to seek the views of the person to whom the information relates. It does not place a limit on this duty.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para9"></a>The implication is that the agency must continue to seek the adopted person's views, regardless of the expenditure of time and resources. In some cases, this will not be possible if the agency cannot trace him. The agency will be required to disclose this information, unless the adopted person refuses his consent, or the agency is able to secure from the High Court an order not to disclose the information. The court could make such an order only if it considered that the circumstances were exceptional. The amendment does not provide for the agency to exercise discretion, nor does it provide for those situations where it cannot trace the adopted person.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para10"></a>This provision would apply to adoptions made since the coming into force of the Adoption Act 1976, but it is not clear as to the date from which it is to apply. For adoptions made after the Bill is enacted, it is clearly unnecessary as under Clause 60, any sibling would be able to apply to the adoption agency for information about his adopted sibling.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para11"></a>For adoptions made prior to the Bill's enactment, birth siblings or other members of the birth family may already seek information about the adopted person. There are four possible routes. The first is to apply to the adoption agency. Regulations provide that an adoption agency may disclose information from its case records as it thinks fit, for the purposes of carrying out its functions as an adoption agency.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para12"></a>The second route for information is through the courts. The courts may also exercise their discretion in disclosing information from their records of adoption cases. Thirdly, birth relatives may seek to contact the adopted adult through the adoption contact register. Finally, a birth relative may apply to the High Court for it to order the registrar-general to disclose the information that is at the focus of this amendment; that is, the linking information.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para13"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 85, first, I commend the ingenuity of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in drafting the amendment, which follows on the debate which took place in the other place. The amendment aims to provide for the registrar-general to pass identifying information about an adopted person to an adopted support agency, so it may disclose if he gives his consent.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para14"></a>The first part of the amendment will provide for the registrar-general to maintain and make available a list of adoption support agencies which provide intermediary support services. Adoption support agencies will be required to register with the National Care Standards Commission in England and with the National Assembly for Wales. I want to make the point here that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the primary function of the registrar-general is the maintenance and control of access to registers for births, marriages and deaths, and in adoption the maintenance of adoption records. The registrar-general has no locus in the registration or maintenance of records for adoption support agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para15"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has made a helpful comment as regards the wording of the amendment in relation to those adopted post 12th November 1975. This part of that amendment also requires the registrar-general, subject to an application being made in a prescribed manner, to provide the adoption support agency with the information necessary to obtain a copy of the adoption certificate from the adopted children register. This would enable the adoption support agency to obtain information such as the names and address of the adopters at the time of the adoption.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para16"></a>The third part of the amendment provides that the registrar-general should not be accountable or liable for any subsequent arrangement for intermediary services made by provision of a list of adoption support agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para17"></a>The final part of the amendment provides that the adoption support agency is not to disclose the identity of the adopted person unless he is given his consent.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para18"></a>I have considered the amendment very carefully. I have already explained in my earlier comments on this group of amendments that intermediary services, which are available in some parts of the country, can provide helpful support and counselling.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para19"></a>In light of the views that the Government have heard from stakeholders on access to information under existing regulations, we have promised to take steps to improve the current arrangements. Guidance will be issued later this year to adoption agencies to help ensure that practice is more consistent. We shall, as I have already implied, advise agencies to take a more positive approach to the disclosure of information and encourage them to base their practice on the provisions that are set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para20"></a>The adoption contact register facilitates contact between adopted persons and their birth relatives where both parties have expressed a wish for such contact. The majority of adopted people and their birth relatives do not know that it exists, and we are consulting on ways in which we can develop a more pro-active and frequent promotion of the register.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para21"></a>For intermediary services, which I believe again have an important role to play here, although the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, was unduly pessimistic about the potential of those services, we have pledged that as part of the Section 64 funding for the financial year starting in April 2003 we will provide money for one leading provider to run the intermediary services support project which will act as a resource for adoption agencies. We believe that their role in providing access to information and in opening up contact between the adopted person and his birth relatives is an important one. That is why we are consulting on the role of those intermediary services and other services through the publication of our providing effective adoption support.

<P>

<a name="20715-30_para22"></a>Adoption support agencies could provide intermediary services under the Bill. In the light of the discussion and Amendments Nos. 82 and 85, we are now prepared to consider whether adoption support agencies could help in the disclosure of information for adoptions made before and after the Bill's enactment. We shall discuss this with adoption stakeholders and also consider the responses to the consultation of the adoption support framework which is to conclude in September.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para23"></a>I have spoken at some length. I think that all noble Lords recognise the importance of this matter, and sympathise with those who sought information and had difficulties in so doing. That is why I have committed the Government to examine current practice under the existing regulations to see what we can do to improve that practice and iron out the variation that is to be found at the moment.
<P>

<a name="20715-30_para24"></a>However, I doubt very much whether we would be wise to accept the amendments, which I believe would put considerable pressure on the very agencies that we are relying on to ensure that the Bill's main provisions, when they are enacted and come into force, are able to perform the core role of ensuring that adoption practice in the future is as effective as possible.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   Before the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, replies, I should like to pick up on a couple of comments that the Minister made. He said that we were talking about the balance of the argument in relation to the other work done by the adoption agencies, but I do not accept that. This is not a matter of balance; it is one of the few absolutes. It is a matter of absolute principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Baroness says that this is a matter of absolute principle, and I agree. However, does she accept that in saying that this is a matter of absolute principle, the law of unintended consequence is such that, by saying that, one might well undermine the ability of these agencies to be effective in their core purpose?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I do not accept that. I think that it is entirely possible, if the Government will it, to have different agencies specialising in different areas of the world. Indeed, it is currently the case that the same agencies are not involved in the process. If there were the will&#151;as there is in countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand&#151;to open up access to this information, it would be entirely possible to set up agencies specifically for that purpose. We could enable voluntary agencies to raise resources from elsewhere and, if necessary, to operate on a charitable basis, as they do in other aspects of the process.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para0"></a>I therefore do not accept the argument about distraction. I do accept that, as long as this remains a matter for secondary legislation, it will continue its descent on the priority list until it drops off the list entirely. That is what will happen. As we know from the daily work of social services departments, dealing with children who present immediate problems is a priority, but this is never a priority at all. In effect, therefore, we are saying that we are quite happy to see the point go.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para1"></a>The Minister also talked about the discretion of the agencies. As he knows, the issue of agencies using that discretion is an extremely complex one. The practice is patchy, and the history of British adoption agencies opening up their records is lamentable. As I have said before to noble Lords, I have spent a considerable amount of time reading up about what happened to the migrant children. The practices of the agencies at that time&#151;most have changed, but some have not&#151;were an absolute scandal.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para2"></a>I am sure that underlying this issue is a fear by some agencies that, when they open up these historical records, they will discover information, comments and notes from that period that would be totally unacceptable to us now. There is great difficulty in persuading organisations that they should voluntarily open up their files when they believe that, by so doing, they may be opening themselves up to litigation. In relation to this Bill, that has been the history of information provided for by secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para3"></a>I have no doubt of the Minister's personal commitment on this issue. However, none of his comments sounded like an absolute commitment to make this work. He seemed to describe just another set of hurdles. I believe that it is clear, even from the guidance issued in 2000, that if such provision does not appear in the Bill, there is no hope of changing the practice of the agencies at all.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para4"></a>The amendment was moved by the noble Lady, Baroness Noakes, and she will chose to do with it as she will. However, on behalf of these Benches, I signal our intention to return to the issue at Report stage. I look forward very much to what the Minister will tell us following his consultation in September. However, if the matter does not have the force of primary legislation behind it, we shall return to the matter with some force.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I wonder whether the Minister could clarify one point. We have been talking about birth parents and siblings seeking information about adopted persons. It seems that the adopted persons' consent will be required before any information can be given out. There is also the opposite situation where the adopted person is seeking information about the birth mother. Will she have an equal ability to refuse consent for disclosure, and will her confidentiality be respected equally?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My understanding is that the answer is in the affirmative. I do not want to intervene again before the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, responds, but I should like to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, whether she accepts from what I have tried to outline that we accept the challenge to improve current practice, and that, through the development of some of the initiatives that I have mentioned, this represents a genuine attempt by the <P>


<a name="column_GC296"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government to improve the circumstances, while being quite open and saying that, of all the things that need to be done, this is not of the first rank?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I do accept that. Nevertheless, although it may be a genuine attempt, in my view it is not a satisfactory one. It still does not address the issue of the agencies. I believe that, above all, an individual caught in this position needs the full power of legislation behind them. The Minister spoke earlier about people having the ability to go to the High Court. Individuals spend vast amounts of their lives trying to obtain a piece of information which they know exists, to which nobody will let them have access.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para5"></a>I accept that it is an attempt. However, on this matter, we have perhaps momentarily come to a point of disagreement. I hope that, before Report, we will be able to reach agreement. However, we one these Benches believe that this is an absolute right. We believe that, in a Bill that sets out in considerable detail the rights of adopted children to pursue it, there ought to be space for those caught in this position&#151;often of their own making&#151;to make their way through a considerable legal thicket, to obtain to information about them and their family.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   This has been a very interesting debate on a very important topic. I thank the Minister for his carefully considered reply, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for their significant contributions. The Minister will be left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling of several of us about the importance of this issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para6"></a>The Minister spoke about the practical impact and burden that the provision would impose on adoption agencies. If I may, however, I refer him to Amendment No. 85, the point of which is to ensure that the burdens are placed on the adoption support agencies that choose to provide intermediary support services. There is no compulsion or requirement on that; it will be funded either by fees or by charitable donations. There is no leeching of resources out of public service. The only impact on the public service would be that the registrar-general would have to provide information but he already has that information. He has been keeping that information so that he has a complete record. The amendment has been drafted in this way precisely in order to meet the practical points raised in another place. The Minister credited me with ingenuity for devising that amendment, but I claim that not for myself because NORCAP and the Children's Society have worked extremely hard to try to produce a solution which met all the practical concerns.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para7"></a>I welcome the Minister's comments about the actions that will be taken and consulted on, leading to other action; in particular promoting the adoption support agency, giving further guidance and trying to eliminate patch practice across the country. All of that is very welcome and I suspect that all those involved in the adoption societies, those who have considerable experience of this, will say, "And not before time". The real issue is going to be whether those actions by the <P>


<a name="column_GC297"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>department could be believed in and trusted to be anything like as good as some kind of statutory right to information.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para8"></a>My preliminary conclusion, standing here today, is the same as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker: it simply could not be. That is partly a product of history and partly because it is unlikely that any kind of guidance would get to a position that would give the wide range of birth relatives who will wish to start a search process the same sorts of facilitation processes to help them in this search.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para9"></a>We will, of course, consider the matter further during the summer, before we come back at Report. However, my feeling at the moment is that we shall want to return to it on Report and to revisit it with considerable vigour. It is an extremely important matter and I would not like the Minister to go away from this Committee feeling anything other than that this is one of the most crucial issues about the Bill. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-31_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 83:

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-31_para16"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
( ) adoption, whenever granted, which the High Court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction orders to be registered in the interest of the adopted person."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-31_para17"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 83 brings us back immediately to an issue relating to retrospection. A week or two ago, I had a letter from an English couple who some years ago adopted two Chinese daughters as babies. Because China is a designated country in relation to overseas adoptions, the couple have not had to re-adopt their daughters in the UK in order for their adoption to be recognised here. However, they cannot register the adoptions in the UK, which means that they cannot obtain a British adoption certificate or birth certificate, even though the children have British citizenship.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para18"></a>That is a very real issue for those two children. We can all think of instances throughout our own lives when we have needed to produce our birth certificates, but those who are adopted in this country have to produce proof of their adoption. The couple of whom I am speaking have already had to provide the birth certificate of their elder daughter when they put down her name for their local primary school. The point this couple have made to me most emphatically&#151;and I am entirely on their side about this&#151;is that it is not in their children's best interests for them throughout their lives to have only a Chinese document showing them as abandoned or with parents unknown. I have copies of the documents here and that is what they say. It surely has to be right that those children should be able to prove easily that their <P>


<a name="column_GC298"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adoption is legally recognised in this country. How can they do that if all they have are their Chinese adoption certificates?
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para19"></a>The Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 will allow for overseas adoptions to be entered in the register. That fact proves to me that the Government recognise the need for this, but what about the many hundreds of children adopted from overseas before the 1999 Act came into force? They cannot be entered in the register; they are effectively in no-man's land. It would be possible for the couple I have been speaking about to readopt their children through the English courts. The problem here is that not all courts are willing to consider such applications. In any case, what an appalling waste of time for social services and the courts, and what a way to treat the children, who would be put under unnecessary pressure meeting social workers and attending court sessions.
<P>

<a name="20715-31_para20"></a>The answer, surely, is to allow the registration of overseas adoptions to take place retrospectively. That is the affect of my amendment, which adds a further category to the definition of registrable foreign adoption to include an

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-31_para21"></a><P>

<a name="20715-31_para22"></a>I am not in general a believer of retrospective legislation. The last group of amendments was a signal exception to that general rule. However, I also believe that this particular retrospective measure is both necessary and humane because it is very much in the interests of children. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020715/text/20715-32.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Earl has raised a very interesting point, and I hope that I shall be able to satisfy him that the position is covered, because I have some sympathy with the points he has raised. Amendment No. 83 would widen the meaning of registrable foreign adoptions. It would extend the scope of registrable foreign adoptions to include those adoptions where the High Court so ordered, irrespective of when or where the adoption order was granted, if it is in the interests of the adopted person.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para0"></a>The reason the Bill limits the registration of foreign adoptions to convention adoptions and overseas adoptions is that we recognise these adoptions in the UK and are satisfied that the procedures in the countries where they are made safeguard the needs of children, both parents and the adopters. In order to ratify the 1993 Hague convention, the country must have in place procedures which meet certain requirements. In order for a country to be included in an order under Clause 85, it will have to meet or demonstrate that it will meet in a reasonable time requirements to be set out in regulations. The countries which are contained in the order will be kept under constant review. This is a very big improvement on simply having a designated list which exists for all time, because countries can then be removed if they are not likely to meet the requirement, and new countries may be added if they prove that they can meet the requirements.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para1"></a>We have understandable concerns about adoptions which are made in other countries which fail to comply with recognised safeguards. Clearly, children and their <P>


<a name="column_GC299"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>families should be protected from the exploitation that exist in some countries where children are given up for adoption as part of a commercial transaction. That is the principle whereby we only wish to register adoptions from countries where the appropriate safeguards are in place.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para2"></a>As we debated at Second Reading, the UK has not yet ratified the 1993 Hague convention, so there are no Hague convention adoptions to be registered. However, it is our intention to ratify the Hague convention in early 2003, and the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 contains similar provisions to the Bill to enable convention and overseas adoptions to be registered where the necessary information is available.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para3"></a>The term "overseas adoption" is defined in Clause 85 as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an adoption of a description specified in an order made by the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-32_para4"></a>This order will specify that adoptions recognised under the designated list set out in the Adoption Order (Designation of Overseas Adoptions) 1973 will be included in the definition of "overseas adoption". This list includes Commonwealth countries and UK dependent territories as well as other countries and territories. The noble Earl will probably know that China was added to the list in 1993. That means that provided the person applying to have the old designated list adoption registered can provide the information and documentation required by the registrar-general, he will register the adoption. The intention is to set out the requirements and information which must be provided in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para5"></a>I have to make it clear that it is possible that when an old overseas adoption was made, the adopters were not provided with the information or documentation that the registrar-general applies to register the adoption. This will vary from country to country, as some countries provide very full information to adopters while others will provide only minimal information. However, where that information is available, the registrar-general will be able to register what are best described as "old overseas adoptions".
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para6"></a>Therefore, as regards the particular example raised by the noble Earl, under current legislation the adoption cannot be registered on the adoption children register. Under the 1990 Act they will be able to do so and they will also be able to do so under the Bill. The term "overseas adoption" includes adoption made under the old designated list. I hope that that reassures the noble Earl, but if he would care to pass me the documentation I shall check out the details of the individual case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   Before the noble Earl replies, ours is joined with his and has an identical purpose. I listened as carefully as I could to what the Minister was saying, and I am still not quite certain whether what he has outlined will have a retrospective impact because that is the point here. It is not what will <P>


<a name="column_GC300"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>happen after 1999; it is what will happen to about 800 children in this country who are adopted and who need to obtain some proper papers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Provided that they are covered by the old designated list, they will be able to apply, and the current legislation in the 1990 Act will apply to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I have listened to the intricacies of this problem&#151;I know a little about them, but not as much as I have been told this afternoon&#151;and it seems to me that the approach of my noble friend must be right. Provided that you qualify the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction&#151;for example, not to be exercised if there is a sale transaction for the children, which is the only one that has turned up but there are others&#151;the approach of my noble friend, which I commend to the Minister, is right. It is the one way to get through this maze of technicalities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I hesitate to argue with the noble Lord on this matter but the approach here is surely that we have the Hague convention, which we hope to ratify very shortly. We also have a designated list of countries whose adoption procedures we believe are, in principle, acceptable. We are giving ourselves greater discretion in relation to a designated list in the future, to allow us to review and to add countries and take them off. It is on that basis that we can then recognise overseas adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para7"></a>In relation to the specific case raised by the noble Earl, from my reading of it&#151;although I will check the details&#151;they should be covered under what we are proposing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister and I accept his answer in the spirit in which it is given. The case I cited relates to two children whose adoption is recognised in this country&#151;there is not question about their adoption not being legal or anything of that nature. However, the parents cannot register the adoption, which is the key issue for the purposes of this amendment. I am encouraged by what the Minister has told me. Effectively, if I have understood him aright, the regulations under the 1999 Act will allow for an element of retrospection, under what he terms the "old adoptions".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The term is "the old designated list".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I welcome that. If I have misunderstood the Minister in any way, clearly he will advise me of that. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-32_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 86:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 90, line 45, leave out from "must" to end of line 49 and insert "inform the applicant that counselling services are available to the applicant as laid out in paragraph 2(1), and strongly recommend that the applicant use those services before giving any information to an applicant"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-32_para16"></a><P>

<a name="20715-32_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 86 I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 87 and 88. Schedule 2, to which this amendment relates, applies only to adoptions made before this Bill becomes law. Paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 2 provides that the registrar-general must not give information to an adopted person who applies for information to allow him to find out about his birth history unless the applicant has attended an interview with a counsellor. We are not opposed to counselling and indeed we believe that the best advice that could be given to an applicant is that he should receive counselling before being given information. However, we find it difficult to agree with compulsory counselling. By definition, it is adults who are applying for information because until they reach the age of 18 they cannot do so. They are not children and it is very likely that they will be considerably older than 18.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para18"></a>We believe, as our amendment proposes, that the registrar-general should strongly recommend that the applicant uses counselling services before receiving the information, but it is not right that a person should be compelled to sit through a counselling interview. That would be taking the nanny state to unnecessary lengths.
<P>

<a name="20715-32_para19"></a>Clause 62 of the Bill also deals with counselling and adoption agencies, but that falls short of compulsion in the sense of requiring an individual to submit to counselling, as opposed to having counselling services made available. Counselling is not compulsory under existing legislation. Can the Minister explain why the Schedule 2 approach is different? If the paragraph remains and individuals do not feel they need any counselling or do not want to use the services of the bodies listed in paragraph 2, they will have a problem. Either they will be denied information that should be theirs by right or they will have to submit to an unwanted procedure, which could well waste scarce resources which would be better deployed elsewhere.

<A NAME="20715-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Amendment No. 86 removes the requirement for an applicant adopted before 12th November 1975 to have received counselling before the registrar-general provides the information. It replaces the current provision with a requirement for the registrar-general merely to inform the applicant that counselling services are available and strongly recommending that he use them. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked an understandable question as to why this should be. The simple answer is that her amendment seeks to overturn a scheme that is based on a clear commitment made by Parliament in 1975. <P>


<a name="column_GC302"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Individuals who do not know their birth details and were adopted before 12th November 1975 are required to see a counsellor before they are given access to their birth records. Individuals adopted on or after 12th November 1975 are informed of the counselling services that are available to them but counselling is not a precondition to disclosure of the birth record information.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para0"></a>The noble Baroness is right about the importance of  good counselling services. The reason for the distinction is that until 12th November 1975 adopted people did not have a right to access their birth records. When Parliament provided this new right, it also gave it to individuals adopted prior to 12th November 1975. To balance the concerns of birth parents who had previously had anonymity, Parliament decided that counselling would be compulsory for those given the retrospective right. An adoption that took place before 1975 could have done so in the expectation that there would be little prospect of the birth parents' identity being revealed to the adopted person.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para1"></a>As Members of the Committee have said in speaking to previous amendments, many adoptions before this time happened in an atmosphere of secrecy. At the time Parliament considered the issue carefully before deciding to allow the adopted adult access to his birth record. As I said, in the light of the potentially sensitive situations that might arise, Parliament decided that the adopted adult should have counselling before being given access to sensitive information.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para2"></a>I am happy to discuss this issue further, but I hope that I have given a clear explanation. One has to respect the reasons why legislators took this decision 25 years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation of the provision. Under Schedule 2 the provision now applies to all adoptions before the appointed day for the Bill; it is not restricted to adoptions prior to 1975. Therefore, the Bill has extended compulsory counselling.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   That is certainly not the position and certainly not the intention. My understanding is that it simply maintains the position for those adoptions prior to the 1975 date.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-33_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now move on to a series of amendments concerning the adoption contact register&#151;clearly one of the key parts of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para9"></a>Amendment No. 89 may seem on the face of it rather odd given the parts of the clause which it seeks to delete. However, the purpose of the amendment is to bring about the extension of the adoption contact register to two groups of people who would potentially be excluded as the clause is presently drafted.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para10"></a>The first group concerns people in this country who are foundlings. I bring to mind the speech made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about that group of people earlier. I assume that there can be no register of their birth. The principal reason behind the amendment is to open up the adoption contact register to people who have been adopted from overseas.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para11"></a>People seeking contact with family members lost through intercountry adoption have an extremely difficult time, even worse than their domestic peers whom we discussed in relation to earlier amendments. Therefore, the effect of this amendment&#151;and indeed some later amendments&#151;is to open up the adoption contact register in such a way that it can be used by people seeking information on someone whose birth was not registered in this country. I refer to the requirement that the registrar-general should be satisfied that a person has such information as is necessary to enable him to obtain a copy of the record of his birth. In the light of the recent discussion we had on the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, there may be people for whom that is simply an impossibility. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20715-33_spmin0"></A><B>The Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </B>  If this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments No. 90 and 91.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-33_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I have a confession to make. When I read this amendment tabled by the noble Baroness I had not realised that this was its purport and intent. Perhaps I can save the time of the Committee by speaking to the issue which the noble Baroness has raised, which I raise in the next group of amendments and which, in the circumstances, I shall not move.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para12"></a>I endorse everything that the noble Baroness has said. As the Bill stands currently, there is no indication as to whether the Government intend to extend the use of the register to those who are at present unable to use it&#151;principally, as she has mentioned, people who were at one time adopted from overseas and the birth parents and siblings of such people.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para13"></a>If we think that it is difficult for British-born adoptees to trace and contact their birth families, and vice versa, we ought to reflect how much more difficult it is for those who were once adopted from a third world country to do the same thing.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para14"></a>Recently, I learned of a case of someone who came to the UK from a fairly poor third world country as a baby, and who some years later, wanted to try to find her birth family. There was another case where the <P>


<a name="column_GC304"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mother of a baby, taken from a third world country and adopted into the UK, wanted to trace her child many years later. There is no framework in the UK which enables a birth relative from overseas to register an interest in being contacted by a child placed in an intercountry adoption and adopted in the UK, nor, in reverse, for that adopted child to register an interest in being contacted by his or her birth relatives. The desire for such contact is natural; it is human. As intercountry adoption increases over the years ahead, as it surely will, more and more individuals are bound to want to avail of such arrangements. If the United Kingdom wishes to regard itself as a paid-up member of the international community in the field of adoption, the least it should do is to ensure that there is a register held by the central authorities, with modest fees, to facilitate such contacts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to the two specific issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and then seek guidance from her. If the noble Baroness were to pursue her amendments, my view is that that would actually take away some of the critical safeguards that there need to be to enable the registrar-general to be satisfied that a birth relationship exists.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para15"></a>As far as concerns the question about whether the adoption contact register should be extended to those affected by intercountry adoption, our view is that the register could be used as a contact facility for inter-country adoptions. As has already been discussed, in future the registrar-general will, with sufficient information, be able to register on the adopted children register the adoption of a person adopted as a result of an intercountry adoption. In such cases, the  adopted person or his birth relative could subsequently register on the adoption contact register. My understanding is that the registrar-general intends to provide this service for future intercountry adoptions if sufficient information is made available to him by applications for registration on the adoption contact register.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para16"></a>I turn to the question of abandoned children. I should tell the Committee that the Government have considered this matter most carefully. From a practical point of view there are a number of very difficult issues that would need to be overcome; for example, there would need to be proof of a blood relationship between the adopted person and the birth family before the register could be used to pass on information.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para17"></a>In such cases, evidence would be required from the adopted person and from possible relatives before an entry could be made in the relevant part of the register. The adopted person and the possible birth relatives would have to be willing to undergo DNA testing to facilitate this process. Another complication is that under Section 27 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, it is a criminal offence to abandon a child under the age of two. If the DNA test confirms the person is the birth parent of the person abandoned as a child, that person would be admitting to having <P>


<a name="column_GC305"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC305</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committed a criminal offence and the registrar-general would be obliged to inform the police. One can see that there is a real difficulty in that connection.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para18"></a>The problem that I have with the amendments is that without the essential details needed of the relationship between the adopted adult and the applicant, the registrar-general cannot be satisfied that a birth relationship exists; and, therefore, there would be no evidence. If this safeguard were removed, any person claiming to be a relative could expect to be registered on part 2 of the contact register, irrespective of whether he were in fact related to an adopted person. That would potentially allow the abuse of the facility intended to assist genuine contact between members of the same birth family. In some cases, this could lead to emotional entrapment of the adopted person if he were led to believe that the other person were a relative with whom he wished to have contact.
<P>

<a name="20715-33_para19"></a>In circumstances where an applicant is not able to satisfy the statute requirements for an entry to be made on the contact register, the registrar-general has referred individuals to NORCAP, as it operates its own contact register. They are then advised that the threshold for proof of a relationship between the two parties on NORCAP's register is lower. However, I understand that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has moved this amendment in order to raise two questions, which I hope I have responded to in an informative way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   The Minister has indeed answered the questions that we were trying to probe. On the issue of the abandonment of children, is there not a statute of limitations in that respect? For example, if somebody had abandoned a child many years before and subsequently came forward to own up, would he or she still be laying themselves open to a criminal offence? I simply do not know the answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I will certainly want to check that out. However, that is but one of the practical problems that one would face if one wished to pursue the route that the noble Baroness suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the Minister for that. I was seeking, perhaps in a defective way, to pursue the issue of opening up the register, particularly for those for whom access has been extremely difficult. I welcome the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in response to that point.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para0"></a>There is no doubt but that the maintenance of an adoption contact register that tracks intercountry adoption will become increasingly necessary. One of the reasons for wishing to do that and to ensure that the adoption contact register fulfils that objective is that, if it does not do so in the Internet age, people will start to do it for themselves, and they will do so in a wholly unregulated way. I am grateful for the Minister's assurances. I shall go away and read his words. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20715-34_para5"></a>The effect of these three amendments on Clause 79(6) is to require the regulations under Clause 79 to provide for the disclosure of information contained in one part of the register to persons for whom there is an entry in the other part. This is a probing amendment. We have tabled it because it is far from clear why regulations should do other than require the linking of Part 1 and Part 2 information by disclosure. That is, after all, what the register is there to do.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para6"></a>Can the Minister give any reason for the current construction of Clause 79(6)? Can he say why regulations should not provide for the disclosure of information between parts of the register? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   This is my first "may/shall" debate. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is not in his place to add to the tally of his great performance in this regard.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para7"></a>I am afraid that things have taken a turn for the worse already. I had intended simply to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that the Government have every intention of bringing forward amendments in case there was any doubt on the point. I should like to dispel any doubts there may be about that.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para8"></a>As for linking, given the construction of the clause, it is extremely important to be clear that where there are two positive corresponding entries in the contact register, one for the adopted adult in Part 1 and one for the adult birth relative in Part 2, that information will be disclosed. If the entries match and both parties wish for contact, this fact, together with birth relatives' details, will be passed on to the adopted adult.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para9"></a>I believe that that, plus the intention to bring the regulations forward, should answer the noble Baroness's question. If they do not, I shall be happy to write to her on those points. I hope that, pending a further and more detailed explanation, she will feel that, on reflection, she can withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. As I said, this is a probing amendment, to try to find out why the provision was constructed in this way. I felt that if the regulations did anything at all, they would provide for the matching of information between Part 1 and Part 2. The provision implied that they might not do so. I heard what the Minister said about the intention to issue regulations to that effect, and that she will look at it again and write to me if necessary. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20715-34_para17"></a>With regard to Amendments Nos. 96 and 97, it is important that we get the terminology correct. The phrase "natural parent" is an odd one because it implies that any other sort of parent is unnatural&#151;it is saying that unconditional love is not natural. Surely it is not unnatural to care for and cherish another person's child&#151;something which has happened throughout history very successfully.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para18"></a>In the Special Standing Committee in the other place, the Minister had some sympathy with our amendment, but preferred the term "birth parents". We accept that the use of the word "genetic" is not perfect, but we should be grateful to hear the Government's thinking on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para19"></a>Amendment No. 98 is a straightforward amendment to probe the regulations. We discussed the thorny problem of "shall" and "may" last week, and I have no hesitation in unleashing these words on the Grand Committee again today. The Government's regulations, entitled Implementing the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, apply to this clause, and we seek clarification on how they do so.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para20"></a>Amendments Nos. 99 and 100 would ensure the use of qualified private social workers, independent of the local authority but approved and registered with them, who would be able to carry out home studies. We wish to ensure that this is on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para21"></a>As a result of one appalling case, that of the Kilshaws, local authorities have on the whole stopped using these private social workers. There is a shortage of resources in many social services departments and a serious problem with recruitment. The important role that these private social workers have played should be recognised and encouraged in the future.

<a name="20715-34_para22"></a>Amendment No. 102 is another "may/shall" provision. Again, we feel that this should be compulsory.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-34_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   If I may, I should like to add to what my noble friend Lord Astor has said in relation to Amendment No. 118, which covers one of the most important omissions from this Bill in the context of intercountry adoption. I am referring to the absence of a service dedicated to facilitating the intercountry adoption process at the crucial linking-up stage.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para24"></a>This is not the first time that I have raised this issue. I make no apology for that because the more I hear about the experiences of those who have been through the mill of trying to adopt a child from overseas, the <P>


<a name="column_GC308"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more horrified I am that we seem incapable in this country of providing such people with a service that will truly help them.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para25"></a>If one decides to adopt from abroad, one first needs to go through a home study. It may say sound strange to say that that is the easy part. However, it is not easy at all for many people because, as we have said before in these debates, home studies for overseas adopters tend to be low priority. One often has to wait a very long time before being assessed. Nevertheless, let us suppose that one has obtained approval under the home study procedure. What does one do next? Well, one chooses the preferred country, and one somehow makes contact with the adoption authorities overseas. You may have a language barrier to overcome, and you have to get the home study package to the relevant place. At one time it used to take about six weeks for the home study bundle to be sent from the Department of Health to the overseas country. It is now taking around five months. You are then faced with negotiating all the elements of the overseas adoption yourself; being linked up with a child who is waiting; making sure that you fulfil all the legal requirements of the adoption laws in the overseas country; meeting all the UK immigration procedures; ensuring that all post-adoption procedures are correctly followed and so on.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para26"></a>The problem is that many of the best organised countries overseas&#151;the countries that are most scrupulously protective of their children&#151;are reluctant to receive applications from people living in the UK. Why is that? It is because we in the UK do not have specialist, dedicated linking agencies, and as a result we are perceived by a number of countries as offering insufficient safeguards for the child, and insufficient safeguards for British families.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para27"></a>I cannot stress strongly enough that this linking stage of the process is absolutely crucial. The Bill as it stands precludes the establishment of specialist agencies in England and Wales unless they are also approved to provide domestic adoption. Why on earth should there be this restriction? Of course, any linking agency must be subject to proper accreditation and inspection to ensure that it is providing a service of the correct quality. But if you want to set up an agency devoted exclusively to providing a comprehensive linking service for intercountry adopters, you can forget it because you will also have to bear the legal, financial, and regulatory burdens applicable to a domestic adoption agency as well. That is quite simply prohibitive.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para28"></a>India is a prime example of the countries where these difficulties emerge. Indian adoption agencies will typically say that in the absence of a partner agency in the UK with whom they can co-operate, they cannot guarantee that the welfare of the child will be monitored, and proper post-adoption support provided over the time period required by Indian law. If by some means the would-be adoptive parents overcome this hurdle, their time and attention has to be devoted to navigating through the administrative aspects of the adoption. They will not be free to <P>


<a name="column_GC309"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concentrate on the far more important task of getting to know their child and ensuring that his or her needs are met.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para29"></a>The Central Adoption Resource Agency in India, CARA, has been saying for years that the functions that the DoH performs as the central authority are, as far as it is concerned, quite distinct from the functions it expects of foreign accredited agencies. Detailed case linking is not in its opinion a function that a government department can or should perform.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para30"></a>Very similar concerns have been raised by China, Colombia, Thailand and the Philippines, to name but a few. When I raised this matter in one of our earlier debates, the Minister as good as said that he and his department knew nothing about any specific problems and it was virtually the first they had heard of them. I am aware that the Department of Health does know about these problems. The Minister's officials have been told in terms by their opposite numbers overseas that these difficulties exist. I do not understand why the Department insists on burying its head in the sand in this way.
<P>

<a name="20715-34_para31"></a>This is a very important matter. I have expressed the view before that would-be adoptive parents who are looking to adopt a child from overseas are treated almost as though what they are doing is somehow reprehensible, so numerous are the practical and administrative hurdles placed in their path. It is time that we came out and said that intercountry adoption is not reprehensible. It is every bit as valid and valuable as any other kind of adoption. My amendment would open the way to making life for such people infinitely easier.

In some respects we repeat some of the arguments which we had in relation to Clause 12. It is important that we do not forget in this discussion the limitations of independent review. There is no independent review of the performance of the Department of Health in this respect.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para0"></a>The noble Earl spoke of the number of different countries that are increasingly reluctant&#151;and in some cases refuse&#151;to deal with the Department of Health. I find myself in some difficulty here as I have evidence not only from the organisations involved in intercountry adoptions but also wholly independently from individuals documenting their own experience. Much of the discontent is of an operational nature.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para1"></a>It is extremely difficult to criticise the performance of the department in a forum such as this. However, I draw to the Minister's attention one particular fact that I was not aware of. A person wrote to me outlining experiences of trying to adopt from China. That person mentioned the endless phone calls, letters and processing of papers which went on. In the midst of that the person revealed one thing which I believe is significant; namely, that UK international adoption is carried out through the Department of Health but it is not allowed to communicate directly with the Chinese Government department which deals with the CCAA.

<FONT SIZE=3>the Foreign Office, the embassy and finally to the Chinese authorities. That means that any contact of any kind takes a minimum of three months. In fact, in practice it takes a great deal longer than that. It seems to me that that is staggeringly inefficient.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para2"></a>These issues came into sharp focus when China changed its rules and set new limits for the numbers of children it was willing to have adopted. The American adoption agencies got their skates on and got on with the cases that they had in line. We did not, with the result that we have an enormous backlog of applicants waiting for adoptions from that country to be processed.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para3"></a>I echo the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about why it is necessary for the Department of Health to fulfil this function at all. I question whether a government department, staffed as it is by civil servants who inevitably change in the course of their work, is the best way to go about this. Would it not be preferable to have an independent body which could&#151;as in many other fields of adoption&#151;not only set itself up as a specialist agency, but could also over time develop continuity, skills and experience among its staff?
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para4"></a>I believe strongly that there is a role for the Department of Health in scrutinising intercountry adoptions. Perhaps if the Kilshaw case did nothing else it showed the very real need for there to be a very powerful scrutinising force within this country. I refer to those people who wish to adopt from overseas. I do not question why people wish to do that; I simply recognise that they will pursue that course if that is their wish. At the moment, in practice, anybody who finds themselves in that position has no alternative but to use the offices of a private American adoption agency. Those agencies are, by and large&#151;or compared to this country&#151;unregulated. It is an absolute lottery whether the agency an individual selects is good or bad. It seems to me that throughout this Bill there is set out a great deal for the Department of Health to do. I am not sure that as a priority it should be the body which is arranging intercountry adoptions, although I take the point that there is a role for it in scrutinising them. With that, I support the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.

<A NAME="20715-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I shall start with Amendments No. 96 and 97 in relation to the amendment raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor. It arose at Committee stage in another place and the amendments as proposed substitute the term "genetic" in place of the word "natural" in Clause 82(2)(a). We took account of the debate in another place, which was clearly raising some very sensitive issues about language that was potentially seen as offensive to adoptive parents and relatives, by implying that the relationship was unnatural&#151;a word the noble Lord has used&#151;and that there were complications and an absence of love.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para5"></a>We looked closely at the possibility of using the term "genetic" in this context. The problem is that when tested, it is in fact imprecise itself. Part of the problem <P>


<a name="column_GC311"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is the possibility that, as with some scientific terms, it can be affected by the boundaries of knowledge as it moves on. Originally, the term "scientist" itself was in fact "natural philosopher". As scientific knowledge develops, terms become refined and the boundaries of what is termed "genetic" may also change as we become more familiar with the scope of the genetic code and its implications.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para6"></a>For that reason, the term "natural parent" is preferable throughout the Bill, not least because it has an everyday, common meaning that can be understood. As regards the relationships we are dealing with and the vocabulary we have to use in order to give people confidence about the Bill and the regulations, it is the preferable term. We took the point up with legal advisers and they did not come forward with anything more suitable.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para7"></a>Amendments Nos. 98 and 102 would place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring persons intending to bring&#151;or cause another person to bring&#151;a child into the United Kingdom under this section to apply to an adoption agency and to give the agency information it requires to carry out an assessment. Similarly, Amendment No. 102 would place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring conditions to be met in respect of a child brought into the country under Section 82.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para8"></a>We have already put in place the Adoption of Children from Overseas Regulations 2001 under the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999. Regulation 3 makes it a requirement that prospective adopters apply to a local authority or to a voluntary adoption agency to be assessed and approved through exactly the same procedures as those for domestic adoptions and therefore to get a certificate of eligibility. The regulations made under Clause 82 would replace with amendments the regulations made under the 1999 Act.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para9"></a>It is our clear intention to make regulations under Clause 82(4) and (5). It is also our intention to consult&#151;and it is important to stress this&#151;widely on the requirements and conditions to be prescribed under these subsections. It is likely that they will be similar to the regulations made under the current Section 56A of the 1976 Act. Perhaps I may illustrate that. For example, the prospective adopters apply to and are assessed by an adoption agency in the UK. The prospective adopters provide as much information as requested. They agree to the carrying out of police and medical checks. The case is referred to the adoption panel. The home study assessment and such other information as is required by the overseas authority is sent to the central authority in the various countries so that it can be checked to ensure that all proper procedures are followed and all the relevant information is collected. Therefore, within 14 days of arrival in the UK with a child they intend to adopt, notice of intention to adopt is given to the local authority in whose area the prospective adopters reside. I hope with that background and that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>framework, and my assurances about consultation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para10"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 99. This amendment would enable social workers acting independently of any adoption agency to assess potential intercountry adopters. May I say at the outset that this is not the product of the Kilshaw case; this preceded the Kilshaw case. Section 13 of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, which amended the 1976 Act, clarified that private social workers could not undertake home study assessments. I will explain that in a moment. It was brought into force in January 2000, before the Kilshaw case.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para11"></a>Linked to this amendment is Amendment No. 100, which would require potential intercountry adopters to provide social workers acting independently of an adoption agency with information for the purposes of an assessment. I take the point made by the noble Lord that we are looking at a lot of pressure on agencies, and this is potentially one way of expanding the workforce. The problem is that it may not do that and it may introduce a few more hazards, and I will explain that in a moment.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para12"></a>When we amended Section 73 of the Adoption Act 1976, we did so through Section 13 of the 1999 Act, which puts beyond doubt that in intercountry cases a home study assessment report for the purposes of adoption must be prepared by or on behalf of an adoption agency and not by social workers acting independently. Clause 82(4) provides that regulations may require a person intending to bring a child into the UK for adoption purposes, or a child he has adopted within the past six months overseas, to apply to an adoption agency for an assessment.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para13"></a>Prior to the implementation of Section 13 of the 1999 Act we believed it was not appropriate for social workers acting independently of an adoption agency to prepare home study assessments. Considerable concern has been expressed, for example, by the Association of Directors of Social Services. It has been concerned about the practice of employing social workers on a private scale outside the framework of the adoption agencies. Their members feel very strongly that the only people who should be permitted to provide home study reports are people who are directly employed or commissioned by adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para14"></a>However, there was conflicting case law on the issue and the Government implemented Section 13 in January 2000 specifically in order to clarify the position. This week the ADSS has written to the Department of Health again in support of the  continued need to prohibit privately commissioned home study reports for the purpose of intercountry adoption. I would be very happy to pass a copy of that letter to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para15"></a>We fear&#151;and clearly these fears are shared by the ADSS&#151;that allowing the assessment of adopters by independent social workers would risk compromising the impartiality of the assessment process. There is also a question of some vulnerability of the social <P>


<a name="column_GC313"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>workers themselves in these situations to the pressure which may be put on them by unsuitable adopters in order to attract other applicants and to increase the number of applicants wishing to use their services. That could mean that applicants are approved when they might not pass the assessment which is carried out formally. The other problem is that there is no process for inspecting the private work of independent social workers, so one is never absolutely sure about quality and quality assessment.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para16"></a>Given the problem of capacity which has been identified, we also ought to reflect on the fact that many agencies choose to contract with an independent social worker to undertake assessments. They can commission them to carry out a home study under supervision as long as that social worker meets the usual regulatory requirements on qualifications, and/or experience. We have a better world now; it may not be the best, but we have additional capacity and we have safety and security for the child. It means that all the necessary information can be obtained: the checks and balances are built in, and the social worker will have access to full medical and police checks. Therefore, social workers will basically be supervised, and there is a far greater guarantee of their general suitability. The agency adoption panel also provides an important, partial input, so other checks and balances come in there.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para17"></a>We appreciate the concern that has been brought forward by these agencies and the pressure that they are under. However, the fundamental line is that we could not allow that to happen, or even take that risk if there were any possibility of unnecessary risk to the child.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para18"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 118, which is more complex. It raises the issues that have been identified by the noble Lord. Perhaps I may begin by saying that I am sorry to hear of the perception of a reluctance&#151;it is not a hostility&#151;to work productively with countries overseas in terms of facilitating adoption. As an opening point and in the light of what has been said, I should like the department to write to Members of the Committee in relation to their response, especially on the question of delays and the perceptions that are held.
<P>

<a name="20715-35_para19"></a>In terms of the six-months' wait, we acknowledge that there has been an increase in the length of time that it has been taking to process papers. I am sure that this has been sorted out, but it would be sensible for me to write to the noble Baroness to point out some of the steps that may have been taken to improve the situation. Apparently, the situation came about as a result of a large number of applications, which seem to have bunched up during the early part of the year. That backlog has caused some problems.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-36_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for that response. When she writes to me, I wonder if she could shed some light on the practice within the department for dealing with papers. I understand from a number of different correspondents that one of the biggest frustrations for people is that they send in their papers and a fault or question mark will appear, which means <P>


<a name="column_GC314"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the papers are sent back to them. The latter are then sent back to the department, at which point another fault comes to light and the papers are returned. Instead of going through the application in one go, the correspondence goes back and forth continually. We can understand that that must be deeply frustrating, because it takes a great deal of time.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para0"></a>Therefore, while dealing with those other points, I wonder whether the noble Baroness could shed some light on the practices of the department, and on how it deals with applications.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I can certainly give the noble Baroness that assurance. It is essential to be thorough. When we deal with adoptions that have been generated overseas, we are not going to be very au fait with the detail, or the information in itself may not be as reliable or as accessible as we would wish for a range of reasons. However, there is a balance to be struck between being thorough and being efficient. I have the highest regard for officials in the Department of Health. I shall certainly ask for a sensible letter to be written to the noble Baroness in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para1"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised a point about CARA. I am also sure that we have never received any representations from CARA, or from any of the other countries to which reference has been made. We have been told by some of the Hague Convention countries that they will only deal with the United Kingdom after ratification&#151;which, of course, will take place next year. Ratification, of course, is going to be next year.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para2"></a>Again, I would feel more comfortable if I could write to the noble Lord, Lord Astor, on the point. A lot has been raised in this debate about these processes and exchanges. It would be good to have those on the record. It would also be good, if it is acceptable to him, to be able to reply in writing to some of the points that he raised.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para3"></a>We are dealing with different perceptions. At this stage in policy development, however, when so much is in transition, and especially when dealing on an international scale, it can be quite difficult to fix the position. There are reasons why these matters sometimes slip.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para4"></a>As I understand it, the purpose of Amendment No. 118 is to enable the establishment of specialist or full-service intercountry adoption agencies. It is understood, or believed by some of the stakeholder groups, that Section 10 of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 precludes the establishment of such agencies unless they are also approved for domestic adoption. Two things need to be said about this. First, the amendment as drafted is unnecessary for reasons that I shall explain. Secondly, it is based on a misunderstanding which I hope to make clear to the noble Lord, Lord Astor.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para5"></a>Section 10 of the 1999 Act amends Section 3 of the Adoption Act 1976 which provides that adoption agencies can be approved for either domestic adoption or domestic and intercountry adoption. The intention of that provision was to clarify that adoption agencies <P>


<a name="column_GC315"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may provide prospective adopters with intercountry adoption services. However, this provision has never been brought into force, and there is no intention to bring it into force before the implementation of the Bill. This is because the provisions in the section have been overtaken by the Care Standards Act 2000, and voluntary adoption agencies will be registered under the provisions of the Care Standards Act from 2003. So in fact the situation has moved forward.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para6"></a>The Care Standards Act enables voluntary adoption agencies to register for adoption facilities unless it is a specific condition of its registration that it does not provide that facility. The effect is to allow the establishment of adoption agencies that can, for example, focus on intercountry adoption. I believe that that should deal with the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Astor. I also reiterate that agencies can register under the Care Standards Act as specialist agencies focusing only on intercountry adoption. That will be done, as I said, under the conditions of registration imposed under Section 13 of the Care Standards Act.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para7"></a>The Adoption and Children Bill repeals Section 3 of the 1976 Act, which Section 10 amends. Therefore, following implementation of our Bill, the provisions in Section 10 will not apply, and it will be removed from the statute book through Schedule 6 for the Care Standards Act. There is therefore no need to repeal it by means of this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-36_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I should like, just very briefly, to express my thanks to the Minister for taking us through that maze. It was extremely helpful. I am sure that there are adoption organisations out there that will be heartened by the Minister's comments, which appear to have addressed one of their major concerns in this important field.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   On Amendment Nos. 96 and 97, I accept that there are problems with the word "genetic"; there is no doubt about that. I felt that the Minister made a very good case for keeping the wording as it is. I therefore anticipate that we shall not pursue that matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para8"></a>I thank the Minister for her very full response on  Amendment Nos. 98 and 102, the probing amendments on the regulations. I was very happy to hear that the Government will be consulting widely on that issue, which is clearly very important. Although we shall need to read Hansard very carefully, I expect to be happy with the Minister's answer.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 99 and 100 concern approved private social workers. I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying why these amendments might introduce further hazards. We clearly need to consider the matter in greater detail. I was grateful to the Minister for pointing out that the Government are planning to bring in additional capacity and additional safety and checks and balances. I should be very grateful to receive a copy of that letter. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20715-36_para14"></a>Clauses 82, 83 and 85 are very important clauses relating to restrictions on bringing children into the United Kingdom, on giving parental responsibility prior to adoption abroad, and overseas adoptions. Our amendments would ensure that no statutory instruments under these regulations were made until a draft of the instrument has been approved by both Houses. We cannot have important regulations such as these brought into play without proper scrutiny by both Houses of Parliament, particularly as the personnel in adoption agencies often work scrupulously to the regulations, rather than to the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="20715-36_para15"></a>I thought that the amendment's purpose was to get the Government to say more about what was in the regulations. However, my noble friend Lady Andrews said a good deal in her speech on the last group of amendments about what the regulations would contain, and I hope that that will be found to be helpful. Fundamentally, however, we go along with the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee which has said that the level of parliamentary scrutiny provided in the Bill is adequate. We do not see any reason to depart from that.
<P>

<a name="20715-36_para16"></a>If adoption agencies have any problems with the regulations when they appear&#151;and after they have been consulted on, because that is an important area&#151;no doubt they will alert noble Lords opposite and a prayer will be produced that they should be debated before going forward. Even a prayer to annul them would be possible. As matters stand, however, we think that we should stick with our respected Committee's views.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   In opposing the Question that Clause 96 shall stand part of the Bill, I wish to raise the question of what role the Attorney-General has in relation to prosecution for offences under Clauses 9 and 58.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para0"></a>This is, in a sense, a surreal debate. Clause 9, as we discussed earlier in Grand Committee, will allow wide-ranging regulations to be issued and will allow a breach of some of those regulations to be treated as an offence. We shall not know what will constitute an offence until we see the draft regulations, and the Minister has already told us that this House will not have the benefit of seeing the draft regulations during our consideration of the Bill. Similarly, Clause 58 creates an offence for adoption societies to disclose information in contravention of Clause 56. That in turn will depend on regulations, so we do not know what kind of offences we are talking about. However, for today, we must imagine that we know what offence is to be created under Clause 9 regulations and what disclosures will be permitted or allowed for the purposes of the Clause 58 offence.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para1"></a>Enter the Attorney-General and the relevant authority. Clause 96 provides that either the relevant authority can institute proceedings or the Attorney-General has to agree. There is no explanation in the Explanatory Notes of why this scheme has been adopted, nor was a real reason given when the matters were discussed in the Special Standing Committee of another place. Will the Minister say why the relevant authority&#151;the National Care Standards Commission or the National Assembly for Wales&#151;should have a monopoly on prosecutions, and will she say why the Attorney-General should have to consent in other cases? What if an individual was aggrieved about the release of information? Let us suppose that the National Care Standards Commission chose to do nothing. Why should the individual have to go cap in hand to the Attorney-General?
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para2"></a>I hope that the Minister will say what public policy objective is served by confining access to redress against those who breach the rules to a limited number <P>


<a name="column_GC318"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of public servants? If there are no good reasons, the only conclusion is that this consent requirement is an unnecessarily onerous one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-37_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I shall be more than happy to assist the noble Baroness in this regard. I understand entirely her anxiety and the need for clarity in relation to this provision.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para3"></a>Clause 96, as amended, sets out that proceedings for offences under Clauses 9 and 58, are to be brought by the registration authority. The National Care Standards Commission will be the registration authority in England, and in Wales the National Assembly for Wales will be the registration authority.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para4"></a>This issue was debated by Members of the Committee in relation to Amendment No. 106 on 24th June in relation to this clause, so that it will specifically refer to the National Care Standards Commission or the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para5"></a>Offences under Clauses 9 or 58 can be prosecuted by another body or person only with the written consent of the Attorney-General and the noble Baroness quite rightly asks why so.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para6"></a>The National Care Standards Commission and the National Assembly for Wales will be responsible for monitoring adoption services provided, and these bodies will be able to provide specialist expertise when conducting prosecutions. This provision ensures that they will be able to do so. During debates on the Bill, the need for specialisation in dealing with delicate issues in relation to the care of children has been emphasised and the body that we have designated as having that responsibility will have that necessary expertise.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para7"></a>Clause 96 mirrors Section 29 of the Care Standards Act 2000 in providing that proceedings for offences under certain clauses may not be brought other than by the registration authority without the written consent of the Attorney-General. The registration authority has been entrusted with the duty of maintaining and enforcing statutory requirement and that task was given by Parliament to the National Care Standards Commission under the Care Standards Act.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para8"></a>The requirement for any individual to obtain the consent of the Attorney-General before seeking a private prosecution is there to avoid prosecutions being brought where no useful purpose will be served, either for the general public or for the individual. This would be where the registration authority had considered that another course of action would be more appropriate. For example, there could be circumstances where an individual wishes to bring a criminal prosecution against an adoption support agency and at the same time, the National Care Standards Commission may be considering what action to take against the registered provider.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para9"></a>It will have the power to amend the conditions of the registration, impose new conditions or cancel the registration, as well as the power to prosecute. The commission may decide not to bring a prosecution but to apply other measures available to it&#151;the most <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate measure. The Committee should remember that we will be talking about regulations systems and systemic change might be what is looked for as opposed to prosecution in relation to one matter. If the individual were then to proceed with his private prosecution, this may disturb the provision of services that could be disproportionate, especially where the commission considers that its own measures are appropriate in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para10"></a>Clause 96 ensures, therefore, that a body with expertise on agency compliance with regulations will be able to take action, including a criminal prosecution, especially as the registration authority will have the knowledge and expertise in determining whether a prosecution is viable. Thus, if for example the National Care Standards Commission uncovers a more serious offence than a contravention of the regulations, the Crown Prosecution Service would be able to pursue it. We think for example of the case where someone has committed a serious offence arranging a private adoption which is restricted by Clause 90, or preparing a private home study report, which is restricted by Clause 92. The noble Baroness said that there is a monopoly. There is not a monopoly; there is an opportunity for the most appropriate agency to undertake the prosecution.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para11"></a>The noble Baroness also asks about what happens then. The Committee will know that if Clause 96 were to be removed and the Crown Prosecution Service took the decision not to prosecute, an individual could seek a judicial review of that decision. Under Clause 96, on the other hand, if the National Care Standards Commission decided not to prosecute, an individual could ask the Attorney-General for consent for an individual to prosecute. If the Attorney-General were to decline, and decline improperly, the individual could seek a judicial review of that decision. It merely sets certain gateways in order to ensure that the needs of children are met.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para12"></a>Naturally, this provision does not preclude any person from seeking a civil claim for negligence against a registered provider. We are trying to work in a joined-up way, however, and to ensure that the most appropriate people undertake the prosecutions that can most appropriately be dealt with by them. We would certainly anticipate the Crown Prosecution Service working very closely where the need arose, where the case stepped outside the pure regulatory nature that we anticipate here. I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with that explanation.

"(3) It shall be the duty of the Lord Chancellor's Department to monitor the proceedings referred to in subsection (1), to keep statistical information on them and to publish a summary of them annually."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-37_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 107, which seeks to add a new subsection (3) to Clause 106. It is a modest amendment designed to keep a spotlight on one crucial aspect of the adoption process; namely, delay. Clause 106 will require a court to draw up a timetable for dealing with questions that arise during adoption or placement order proceedings. We welcome this measure.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para19"></a>The new subsection would place a duty on the Lord  Chancellor's Department to monitor those proceedings, to keep statistical information on them and, importantly, to publish a summary annually. At present, I understand that this information is not kept by the department.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para20"></a>It is not entirely clear where the main delays arise in handling adoption cases. There is agreement that there is delay, but, from different ends of the telescope, there are different reasons ascribed to where those delays occur. Those in the legal system say that the delays arise outside the legal system; for example, in the making of reports or assessments. Those outside the system tend to suggest that the lawyers are to blame&#151;whether the courts themselves, or the lawyers acting in the case. Keeping statistics and publishing them would be an important tool in unblocking any further causes of delay. As measurement and management go hand in hand, until we can measure the dimensions of the problem we cannot begin to manage it.
<P>

<a name="20715-37_para21"></a>I know that the Government are committed to eliminating delays in the adoption process. I am therefore confident that the Minister will welcome this amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I shall be able to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that her concern in this regard is unnecessary. I shall seek to explain exactly what the Government are currently doing in relation to these matters.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para0"></a>When a court is dealing with a matter where a placement or adoption order might need to be considered, Clause 106 provides that it will be under an obligation to draw up a timetable and give any directions that are necessary to ensure that that timetable is adhered to. We certainly believe that this should make a material difference to the issue of delay. <P>


<a name="column_GC321"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This clause will ensure that the courts maintain a tighter control on adoption and placement proceedings and do not allow them to drift.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para1"></a>Clause 106(2) also gives the power for rules to set out the time-scales in which certain processes should take place, and to make any other provision with respect to these proceedings to prevent delay.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para2"></a>As the noble Baroness explained, Amendment No. 107 would require the Lord Chancellor's Department to monitor proceedings relating to placement and adoption orders, to keep statistical information on them, and to publish a annual summary of them.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para3"></a>We already have a considerable amount of data. Statistics relating to the operation of courts and adoption proceedings are published on a regular basis. The Office for National Statistics in its Population Trends series publishes information on adoption resulting from the analysis of adoption orders and adoption applications provided by the Court Service. Similar information is also published annually in the  judicial statistics by the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para4"></a>The Government intend to enhance the collection of information on adoption. We have identified the key stages in the adoption court process. Cases issued in a specialist centres in January 2002 are being tracked to monitor the time taken and to ascertain what barriers there may be to delivering an efficient service to all those involved in adoption cases. The noble Baroness is right to say that many reasons are given by different parties as to why this is happening. Some kind of empirical understanding of this issue would greatly assist everyone.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para5"></a>At the same time, we are working to create a unified data collection system so that detailed and useful information on adoption is collected routinely. This will enable bench-mark time-scales for cases to be set. It is the first step to meeting the commitment made by the Government in the adoption White Paper to reduce delay and improve the level of service to people using the courts by designating specialist centres, issuing guidance to courts on case management and obtaining sample information on adoption. We will consider the best way in which this information should be made available.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para6"></a>A range of statistical information is made available on a regular basis and a programme of work is currently underway to ensure there is a comprehensive data collection system on the courts' performance in relation to adoption. This work will ensure that we are in a position to make available on a regular basis the statistics Members of the Committee would like to see. Therefore, we hope the noble Baroness will accept that this amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. From what she has said, the enhanced information should enable the sources of delay to be identified and therefore action taken, and that information would be published in some form or another. If that is the case, I have pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20715-38_para10"></a><P>

 "REGULATIONS FOR SEPARATE REPRESENTATION OF CHILDREN
<br>
 In section 8 of the 1989 Act after subsection (4) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"(5) The Lord Chancellor may make regulations providing for the separate representation of children in specified circumstances relating to any matter arising from proceedings under this section.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-38_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: The "ZZs" give no suggestion of any soporific purpose in this. I must apologise to the Committee for having appeared, as it were, by parachute. If any Members had been watching the screen, they will have seen that I have been fairly busy in the Chamber and will be again later tonight. I regret that I have not been able to follow more of the proceedings of this Committee and I have been interested in those I have.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para12"></a>We now come to a cluster of amendments which are  all concerned with the problems of contact and  especially of enforced contact. Amendment No. 107ZZA deals with independent representation of the child. Amendments Nos. 115 and 116 also deal with this.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para13"></a>I do not believe that any Member here is quite so optimistic as to pretend that we have yet achieved gender equality, but I believe that we are making fairly steady, even if rather glacial, progress towards it. Occasionally one feels in gloomy moments moved to doubt it. What convinces me that that is the case is that when occasionally I am pulled up for having made a chauvinist or old-fashioned assumption, it is not women of my own generation who do so, it is my two sons. I have seen in my own family a steady advance in attitudes ever since my grandfather first converted my great-grandfather to a very reluctant support for votes for women in the 1860s.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para14"></a>The progress is steady but it is necessarily a part of any such progress that, as we have been seeing women steadily wanting to involve themselves in what have been male spheres of operation, so also we must see men wanting to involve themselves in what have regularly been seen as female spheres of operation. The fact that now more than ever men want to be involved in child care is a development that we all welcome, and those who have listened to me at Question Time in the Chamber know that is a long-standing opinion of mine. That that should be encouraged is entirely good.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para15"></a>However, the difficulty with law enforcement, and in particular the difficulty with law enforcement on the lower level, is that it seems to be only capable of getting one idea at a time. The idea that men have contact with their children is a good one, but that must be subject to two other provisos. The first, with which this amendment is concerned, is the consent of the child. The second, we shall come to in the next amendment <P>


<a name="column_GC323"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, and the one after that which is to be moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton. As my name is also to it, I shall move it if she is not here. It deals with the question of safety because if the welfare of the child is to be taken as paramount, the child's safety must be the most paramount consideration of all. Where a contact order is at the expense of safety, there would be a case against it&#151;I shall come to that later.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para16"></a>The central contention of this amendment is that a child is not a chattel. A child has a mind, a will, passions, hopes and fears, and any policy for giving contact orders which does not take account of that will do good neither to the child nor to the parent with whom contact is sought.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para17"></a>Before the council closed it&#151;in circumstances with which I shall not detain Members of the Committee&#151;there was a women's refuge extremely close to us. My wife used to visit it regularly. Normally, of course, they did not admit men, but just once they let in my son, then aged 18. He had been carrying a large bundle of clothes, books and other things for the refuge and was left standing outside on the wettest day of the year, so they very kindly took him in. He found, although he did not know it, that the boy of six he was first talking to was one who ran screaming in terror at the sight of any man who came anywhere near him. It is fairly obvious that that terror is itself evidence of something fairly traumatic that had happened to him.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para18"></a>It turned out, on inquiry afterwards, that he had been regularly buggered by his grandfather with a knitting needle. One of the moments when I have been most proud of my son was when he was the first man with whom this boy of six condescended to play. He of course tried to wreck the game and my son told him, "If you want to stop you can, but that if you are going to wreck the game we cannot go on", so he went on. In cases like that, the child's own state of mind must be taken as key evidence.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para19"></a>It is a sad fact that, where parents separate, the father does not keep contact nearly as often as one would like. It is regularly said that the mother has poisoned the child's mind against the father. That, of course, is a very laden word. In some cases, it may be absolutely literally appropriate, while in others it may represent simply a value judgment. One does not know which, without knowing the particular family very well indeed.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para20"></a>Suppose it to be literally true. For poison, the law is the wrong learned profession to call in. If the child feels that way, the feeling is a fact, whether justified or not, and the law cannot cure it. Enforced contact, in this situation, can be nothing but a cause of terror and it is likely to be an obstacle to the mending of the relationship between the father and the child&#151;because, very often, it is the father who is involved. It may prevent what could, in other circumstances, have been a slow mending of trust between the two people, producing a real and deep friendship. If one destroys that by enforced contact, creating terror in the child, I <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>do not see that one is doing good to the child, or to the father, or to the interests of the family, or indeed to the interests of justice.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para21"></a>The point about giving a child independent representation is that it allows the child to think for himself. It puts him down in a place where he can talk to someone with no axe to grind. Sometimes, it is simply a matter of getting away from the influence of the resident parent, or sometimes it is a matter of allowing him to think until the mind changes. Sometimes, it becomes clear that the mind is so deeply set that any chance of contact would be completely useless. Sometimes, indeed&#151;though that brings us to the next amendment&#151;it brings us to situations where contact would be so dangerous for the child that it is not to be advised.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para22"></a>We have had a lot of discussion of the House of Lords judgment of In Re H & R&#151;the one that said the more serious the allegation, the higher the standard of proof that was needed. This was a case in which a girl had accused her stepfather of raping her. The question here is not just whether that allegation was proved. Suppose it was false? That to me would indicate perhaps a situation as serious as if it were true because, if that allegation were falsely made, it would indicate a dislike of the stepfather so deep that that in itself would be an obstacle to contact.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para23"></a>I did wonder, reading through the judgments in that case, whether their Lordships&#151;who, in general, I regard as the highest intellects it has been my privilege to listen to in this Chamber&#151;had perhaps got the wrong end of the stick. They were concerned only with the man's rights and those rights, naturally, might also depend on whether he had done something wrong. If, however, they had taken literally the proposition that the interests of the child should be paramount, they should have been considering whether the child's feelings about the stepfather for whatever reason were so deep and so hostile as to render all contact at best useless and at worst positively dangerous.
<P>

<a name="20715-38_para24"></a>Suppose I had been advocate for that child? These are questions about which I would have thought very hard; I have no idea what I would have said in court. Whatever it was, I hope it would have been something that the court might have found interesting to listen to. There is a whole realm of justice that begins from the recognition of the child as an independent person with rights, with hopes, with fears and with a will. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20715-39_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for not being here earlier in the proceedings this afternoon. I strongly support the amendment standing in my name and that of the noble Earl. There has long been grave concern at the gap in child protection measures that our private law arrangements allow. During proceedings on the Family Law Act 1996 my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe there is a general consensus arising out of the committee proceedings that it would be desirable that the interests of children have representation in some way".

<a name="column_GC325"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para1"></a>Earlier, Paul Boateng had strongly urged his concerns that the child's interests were not being well enough represented. Indeed, he called this matter very strongly to the attention of the House. This point was attended to in the Family Law Act 1996 under Section 64&#151;an Act that unfortunately foundered, not for any reason to do with this particular amendment. The principle has already been agreed. It has been placed on statute which has only fallen through ill chance. Surely, there can be no case that this amendment is premature or that arrangements are required prior to legislation to see how it would be put into practice.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para2"></a>Clearly, we are failing to protect our children adequately. To give an example: the children of a mother who was an alcoholic&#151;the mother incapable of parenting&#151;were left in her care while she sought to deny access to their father. On one occasion the 10 year-old daughter was left sitting on the stair by her mother who told her that she was going to the shops to buy food for their supper. Mother did not return and this was just one example of her inconsistent treatment of her daughter.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para3"></a>The father in this situation kept quiet because he sought a reconciliation with the mother. It was only after a guardian was involved and a thorough report on the wishes and needs of the children was produced that it was decided to move the children in with their father and his extended family. The children then thrived in the new situation. This amendment seeks to address the gap that currently exists in our child protection system. It seeks to ensure that in certain circumstances the voice of the child is particularly well attended to. The example I have just cited is not an uncommon one of parents who are under pressure and children who are at risk but are not in a sufficiently critical situation for a care order to be introduced.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para4"></a>A mechanism already exists to introduce a guardian and a child solicitor into this process. In Section 9.5 of an Act, the name of which I have forgotten, there already exists such a measure. However, this is seldom used, is difficult to invoke, causes long delay to proceedings and is inadequate to meet the needs of children.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para5"></a>In another case a mother was threatened with imprisonment for failing to allow the father access to their three year-old daughter, whom I shall call Melanie. Christopher, the 14 year-old son, and Katie, the 18 year-old daughter, were not consulted or asked for their opinion on what was going on in their family. Following the intervention of the National Youth Advocacy Service (NYAS), Christopher's concerns about the treatment of his three year-old sister were manifested to the court. He had experienced severe violence from his father and had heard from Melanie information which led him to be concerned that she might be being used sexually by their father. A full report by the guardian enabled a proper resolution of the case.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para6"></a>The number of instances where mothers are being faced with imprisonment is increasing. Surely, there can be absolutely no excuse for not finding out the wishes and needs of children in these circumstances. <P>


<a name="column_GC326"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Our amendment would allow this while also permitting flexibility to the Lord Chancellor so as not to incur unnecessary expense to the public purse.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para7"></a>Concern has been expressed that introduction of a  right of children to representation in some circumstances in private law cases would slow down proceedings and add to costs. Currently, it is true that this can be the case under the Section 9.5 currently used. However, this amendment would allow timely involvement of advocate and guardian. A full report to the court on the wishes and needs of the children will often enable a speedy resolution of proceedings. The additional cost of a child's representation could be met by an increase in the divorce filing fee, which would enable a couple better to meet their parental responsibilities to their children and would be very much in line with the Government's desire to promote parental responsibility. I feel strongly that this amendment, or something similar to it, should be incorporated into the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<A NAME="20715-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   I rise to support the two noble Earls who propose the amendment. There is, indeed, a gap in legislation arising out of the non-implementation of Section 64 of the Family Law Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para8"></a>During the passage of the Family Law Act 1996 through the House of Commons great emphasis was placed by the then Opposition on the need for the separate representation of children involved in private law proceedings. Indeed, as the noble Earl has said, such was the concern that Paul Boateng, leading in Committee, chose separate representation and domestic violence as the two items for a set piece debate at Report stage. At that time he researched the position of children involved in private law disputes as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a neglected family justice issue" [Official Report, 17/6/96; col. 589.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-39_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20715-39_para10"></a>Indeed, there was a consensus in both Houses on this matter. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, spoke on the Family Law Bill on 29th February 1996. The result was Section 64 of the Family Law Act, which has already been referred to.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para11"></a>The failure to implement this provision does not diminish the need for it. Indeed, the intervening years have led to increased concerns about the vulnerability of children involved in situations of domestic violence, and the lack of capacity for the court to order separate representation for them within Section 8 of the private law proceedings. Also, as current experience is showing, without such provisions there are effectively few safeguards within the present system.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para12"></a>A government briefing of 26th June refers to a "scoping exercise" before undertaking wider consultation on how children are represented in private Children Act proceedings. That indeed is welcome. However, I am bound to ask: how much more consultation is there needed to add to a debate about which there was such cross party consensus which was agreed six years ago? The facts are very clear <P>


<a name="column_GC327"></a>

<A NAME="20715-39_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have participated in this debate? The issue generates a great deal of concern and I understand why that is so. However, I hope that what I say will be reassuring to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para13"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, quite rightly says that the child is not a chattel, and that the child's state of mind is of real value and importance. He makes some telling points about the need to mend fences and to make sure that where a relationship has been fractured there are attempts to reconstruct that relationship in a constructive way, and to go at the child's pace, all of which is right.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para14"></a>When the courts come to determine these issues in the exercise of their judicial discretion, those are precisely the issues that any judge dealing with these matters will have to take into account.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para15"></a>I would also like to reassure the noble Earl that on many occasions where children have proven to be implacably hostile to contact, the courts have taken that implacable hostility into account, notwithstanding the fact it may not be soundly based, because the welfare and interests of the child determine that that is the criterion that the court gives weight to. I know that there is concern about these issues, but I hope I can reassure the noble Earl in relation to that matter.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para16"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of In Re H & R , which was is a very specific case. It was a public law case where care proceedings were on foot and it had to be determined whether the step parent had or had not sexually abused the child. It was really dealing with the burden of proof in relation to those matters. Although it may be right that it settled the burden of proof, if I may respectfully say so, it does not detract at all from the court's determination of what is in the welfare of the child on any particular case.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para17"></a>The most important issue is whether the child's voice is at present able to be heard, and what steps there are at the moment, if any, to make sure the child can, or is represented in given circumstances. I hope that I will be able to reassure Members of the Committee about the current position. Amendment No. 107ZZA would allow my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to make regulations providing for the separate representation of children in specified circumstances arising from any proceedings under Section 8 Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para18"></a>Currently, children's views are generally put before the court in private law Section 8 proceedings, within the CAFCASS officer's report on matters relating to the welfare of the child. The Lord Chancellor may make regulations specifying matters to be dealt with in any report, and in addition the court can make particular directions as to matters to be included in the report. This matter is already dealt with quite extensively by the Family Proceedings Rules.

<a name="20715-39_para19"></a>Rule 4.11B of the Family Proceedings Rules requires the CAFCASS officer, known as the child and family reporter, to notify the child of the contents of his report as he considers appropriate to the age and understanding of the child, including any reference to the child's own views on the application and recommendation of the CAFCASS officer. Rule 4.11B(5) also requires the child and family reporter to consider whether it is in the best interests of the child to be made a party to the proceedings. The Family Proceedings Rules 1991 already allow a child to be made a party to private law proceedings where the court considers it appropriate to do so; for example, where expert evidence has to be adduced by a guardian ad litem on behalf of the child or where the child is of sufficient age and understanding to instruct a solicitor. The court will make the child a respondent where it would be in the child's best interests, and CAFCASS has taken over the Official Solicitor's role in such cases.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para20"></a>A child being separately represented would involve a lawyer being instructed to put evidence before the court on behalf of the child, and if there is a guardian ad litem&#151;usually a CAFCASS officer&#151;the guardian will instruct the solicitor. If the child is mature enough to instruct a solicitor directly, the court may allow her to do so. In those circumstances the court would consider very carefully whether it would be in the child's interests to listen to the evidence given by his or her parent in the case and give his or her own evidence. One should not under-estimate the potential for difficulty where a child becomes a full party in proceedings and takes up arms in terms of legal representation in relation to these issues.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para21"></a>As many Members of the Committee will know, the Government are currently undertaking a scoping exercise about undertaking wider consultation on how children are represented in private law Children Act proceedings. My noble friend Lady Thornton asks how much more consultation we need. The most important thing is not simply that we allow children to be represented or participate in proceedings because they can already do that through the rules I have just set out. It is how we make that effective. How do we make sure that the child's voice is heard.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para22"></a>The consultation process we are going through will be with those agencies which are intimately connected with children and more broadly to try to find the best conduit for that child's voice, so that the effect of what the child says will be heard in a more meaningful and effective way. We have to try to find the right mechanism to do that. We therefore believe that consultation is an important step to take. Our current plans anticipate a full consultation commencing later this year.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para23"></a>This amendment is in similar terms to provision in Section 64 of the Family Law Act 1996. As Members of the Committee are aware, on 16th January 2001 the Lord Chancellor announced in a Written Answer that the Government were not satisfied that it would be right to proceed with the implementation of Part II of the Family Law Act 1996, within which Section 64 falls. The Government will invite Parliament to repeal <P>


<a name="column_GC329"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the relevant sections of the Act once a suitable legislative opportunity occurs. At that time, the Lord Chancellor made it clear that it would not be possible to cherry pick particular provisions of the Act and implement them separately, as the provisions of Part II were all procedurally linked.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para24"></a>Having considered this matter very carefully, we do not believe that we need to replicate Section 64 of the Act in the Bill. There is already a wide rule-making power in Section 93 of the Children Act 1989 which allows the Lord Chancellor to make rules on a variety of matters which would include the representation of children.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para25"></a>In addition, the rule-making powers under the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and other related statutes will also remain in place, so that rules on this issue will continue to be able to be made for divorce or children proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20715-39_para26"></a>This amendment, which I hope your Lordships will accept, is therefore not required in order for secondary legislation to set out where children should be separately represented in private law proceedings. We have that power now and the rules provide for this to occur.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-40_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, can I try to clarify one thing that she said about the case of In Re H & R? Am I right in understanding that she was saying that, because it was a public law case, it therefore does not create a precedent in private law?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   No, I was not saying that. I was saying that the case of In Re H & R was in relation to a sexual abuse allegation made in a public law case where the judge at first instance had not clearly set out that he understood which burden of proof should be applied. That issue was thereafter clarified.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para0"></a>I am saying that in considering whether there should or should not be contact&#151;which was the issue on which the noble Earl concentrated in his remarks, and is something with which the courts are familiar&#151;the whole issue of what is in the child's paramount and best interests is something that the courts have been able to take into account. Therefore, where there is implacable hostility towards the parent, the court can be seized of that fact and take appropriate action in order to protect the child. That is within judicial discretion.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para1"></a>I was simply reminding noble Lords that In Re  H & R referred to specific, public law circumstances where the balance of the burden of proof was under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-40_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness. I might then possibly speculate&#151;but I can do no more than speculate&#151;that future such cases might not necessarily lead to the same decision. However, this is dangerous ground and I shall not venture any further on it.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para2"></a>I appreciate very much indeed the whole tone of the Minister's reply. In fact, it was about as generous as a reply can be without doing what is asked. I <P>


<a name="column_GC330"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understand, of course, that the power to do what is asked already exists. I know that it is sometimes exercised. There was a case recently among people who are known personally to me where the decision to produce an independent advocate for the child saved what was threatening to turn into a very nasty situation and produced an entirely satisfactory resolution.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para3"></a>However, the fact that it can be done does not prove that it always is done. What I should like to see is the idea that the child has a potentially separate interest is so much part of the air we breathe that it is automatically part of the representation that is before the court. Otherwise, I do not see how we can know in advance of a long, private conversation with the child, such as we are not likely to be vouchsafed, whether in fact this is one of the cases in which an independent advocate is needed or not. It is only when we have the independent advocate that he or she may find out whether they are or are not needed.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para4"></a>I understand, of course, that the courts in divorce and subsequent proceedings allow the child to state a preference. I have actually been here myself, and looking back on it, I believe that I got it absolutely and entirely wrong. I stated my preference. I stated it, if I may say so, somewhat in the manner of a gramophone record, believing that I did so in all total sincerity. So far as I was capable of knowing at that time, that was the case. If anything could have opened my mind, it would have been the chance to listen over a fairly prolonged period to the sound of my own voice, making my own case, to somebody listening to me with no axe to grind whatsoever. That can be a very salutary experience, as many of us have found in the course of debate in your Lordship's House.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para5"></a>I would have valued the chance to have that experience. I would like people who come after me and are in this situation to have that experience.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para6"></a>So, I still think that the amendment would do something that is not being done at present. However, I do not think that this is a matter where Divisions are likely to be particularly useful. This is a culture change we are going through. What I deduced from the Minister's reply was that we are at present halfway across the channel. I look forward, therefore, to going a little further. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ALLEGATIONS OF ILL-TREATMENT MADE IN SECTION 8 PROCEEDINGS

 After section 8 of the 1989 Act there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"8A ALLEGATIONS OF ILL-TREATMENT MADE IN SECTION 8 PROCEEDINGS
<br>
(1) Where it is alleged that a party to the proceedings has inflicted ill-treatment on the child or on another person, the court shall, as soon as practicable, determine on the basis of the evidence presented to it by or on behalf of the parties to the proceedings, whether the allegation of ill-treatment is proved.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) Where the court is satisfied that a party to the proceedings (in this section referred to as the "abusive party") has inflicted ill-treatment on the child or on another person, the court shall not&#151;
<br>
(a) make any order granting the abusive party residence of the child; or
<br>
(b) make any order granting the abusive party contact (other than supervised contact) with that child,
<br>
unless the court is satisfied that the child will be safe while the abusive party has residence of, or contact with, the child.
<br>
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where in any section 8 proceedings&#151;
<br>
(a) the court is unable to determine on the basis of the evidence presented to it by or on behalf of the parties to the proceedings whether or not an allegation of ill-treatment is proved; but
<br>
(b) the court is satisfied that there is a risk of harm to the child,
<br>
the court may make any order under this Act that it considers necessary to protect the child.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20715-40_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is intended to explore what I appreciate would be a truly significant change in British law. I should like now to explore the possibility of making such a change, and at a later stage we may be able to consider the possibility of what might be achieved by such a change.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para11"></a>When I was briefed about this amendment and had a discussion about it with an honourable friend in another place, she said that they did not get a chance to discuss it thoroughly because it came in at the tail end of their discussion in Committee. I assured her that that was not likely to happen in your Lordships' House and that there would be a full discussion in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para12"></a>This amendment seeks to address the issue of ensuring that contact and residence arrangements are safe for children. In another place, the Government tabled amendments to the Adoption and Children Bill which will amend the Children Act to include witnessing domestic violence under the definition of harm and to require that the courts decide whether allegations of violence are proved before granting contact. I think that everyone will warmly welcome that move.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para13"></a>However, the Government did not go so far as to require the courts to ensure that contact or residence orders are safe for children. Many of us feel that this is essential. In recent years, children have been killed in England and Wales as a result of contact arrangements. I need not go into detail about those cases now because many noble Lords mentioned them on Second Reading. However, since then, I have received evidence and reports of further cases to which I shall refer in these remarks.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para14"></a>In these circumstances, we could perhaps learn from the experience of New Zealand. As noble Lords may recall, in 1994, New Zealand was shocked by the murder of Christine Bristol's three children by their violent father. What was particularly shocking in the case was that Alan Bristol, the father, had been granted residence of the children even though his wife had obtained a protection order against him. A ministerial inquiry was set up, and within five months <P>


<a name="column_GC332"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it concluded that this tragedy could not have been prevented under their family law as it was then. The New Zealand Guardianship Act 1968 was subsequently amended to provide greater protection for children.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para15"></a>The key feature of this legislation is a rebuttable presumption. It is the presumption that residence and unsupervised contact will not be granted to a parent who is found to be violent. Clearly, the courts cannot be held accountable for the safety of a child in all circumstances, and the rebuttable assumption is not an absolute presumption. Orders for residence and unsupervised contact may be granted if the court is satisfied that this will be safe for the child. This lies at the heart of the amendment that I am proposing today.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para16"></a>It is essential that our family law justice system does not place children in danger. When I have been describing to friends and acquaintances why I am exercised by this issue, they find it absolutely amazing that children are not offered the same protection in private law proceedings as they are in public law proceedings&#151;that children can be placed in these kinds of danger. It is an issue that requires a remedy. That is one remedy; it may not be the right one, but there is no doubt in my mind that this issue requires a remedy.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para17"></a>In conclusion, I shall refer to some of the cases that have been brought to my attention by Women's Aid. The organisation has written to me about seven new cases that have come to its attention. These are in addition to the 15 deaths that the Lord Chancellor's Department is at present examining. The letter from Women's Aid mentions four cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse, which is notoriously difficult to prove legally. One mother could not provide the "higher standard of proof" required by the judgment In Re H & R (Child Sexual Abuse) [1995], which has already been referred to in this Committee.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para18"></a>In three of these cases residence was granted to the father against the professional advice provided by child psychiatrists, child psychologists, and a doctor. In the fourth case, social services confirmed that a friend of the father was a known paedophile, and the senior social worker stated that he had no doubt that the mother was telling the truth when she alleged child sexual abuse. Another mother has refused to comply with a residence order, has terminated all contact with outside agencies, and has gone into hiding with her four children&#151;frankly, that is what I would do in that situation.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para19"></a>In three cases there was evidence of violence to the mother in terms of police records and non-molestation orders. In one case, the court applied the good practice guidelines, concluded that the father was sexually deviant, and had been very violent to the mother and granted him residence. Another father was granted residence despite acknowledging that he had been violent to the mother while she was holding the child. I could go on.
<P>

<a name="20715-40_para20"></a>There is a serious problem here and it is twofold. First, we have the culture that has&#151;quite rightly&#151;been encouraged by my Government; namely, that <P>


<a name="column_GC333"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parents should take responsibility jointly for their children, that fathers in particular should take responsibility for their child, and that contact is, by and large, a good thing. The problem is that this is leading our courts not to take the child's safety into consideration. It is a cultural issue about which the law is not necessarily required to do anything. However, it does require action by the Lord Chancellor's Department&#151;a matter that I know those concerned are addressing. Secondly, this is such a serious issue that the Government need to address it by way of legal remedy. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-41_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I rise to support this amendment. In the absence of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, who was to have moved Amendment No. 107ZB, I shall speak also to that amendment.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para0"></a>The real trouble with domestic violence is that people do not like the idea of it. They do not like thinking about it and, because they do not like thinking about it, they like to pretend that it does not happen. Alternatively, like Dickens, they like to think that it happens only among those mean persons in the lower classes from whom proper manners cannot be expected. That, of course, is very far from the case. It is by no means class-specific. However, because people do not like thinking about it, it is not part of the culture in a great many circles to take the care about it that would be taken about any other danger of equal severity.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para1"></a>As recently as this morning, we read in newspaper reports of a case&#151;about which it is far too early for us yet to know the rights and wrongs&#151;regarding four children and their father who were found dead in a car, with a suicide note being left by the father. A case like this reminds us of one of the possibilities that must be considered; namely, that the father has in fact killed his own children. I will say no more. I hope that that is not in any way a prejudicial comment.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para2"></a>Neglect and abuse are not entirely gender-specific, although obviously it is much easier for someone of superior force to do it. There is also a case that was reported in Community Care, since this amendment was tabled. This was a finding of the Ombudsman against Birmingham City Council. The father complained about his children being put temporarily into the care of his former partner. The report states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The ombudsman found that all three children experienced significant neglect and some of the ill-treatment could have been avoided if the children were removed sooner.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-41_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The concerns expressed by the man and his children's school were 'largely ignored', no proper investigation was carried out and no social worker was assigned to the family, the ombudsman concluded".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20715-41_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20715-41_para5"></a>The ombudsman said that the attitude of staff towards the father who was complaining was "inexcusable" and ordered the council to pay £2,000 to the father and an undisclosed sum of damages to the children to be held in trust until they are 18. Birmingham City Council has better things than that to do with its money. That is from communitycare of 13&#150;19 June 2002.
<P>


<a name="column_GC334"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para6"></a> We need a greater and wider degree of awareness than we have at present. Women's Aid, after the new guidance from the Lord Chancellor's office, and after the publication of the consultation paper entitled Making Contact Work, conducted a survey among 127 refuges. In passing, let me say that I hope that one of the things that is happening out of the Chancellor's largesse this afternoon is the provision of a number of women's refuges rather closer to the already inadequate number asked for by the Home Affairs Select Committee in 1975. That is something on which progress is needed.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para7"></a>The survey asked whether court practice had generally improved since the consultation. Of 127 refuges, only 11 thought it had, 66 thought it had stayed the same, 11 thought it had become worse and 39 said they did not know. They were asked whether children who did not want contact with a violent parent were being listened to and taken seriously, and two in 127 said yes, 39 said sometimes, 40 said that the children were not being listened to in these circumstances, and 45 per cent said they did not know.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para8"></a>The survey gets worse as it goes on. It is from an organisation with which I have done business many times, and I have learned that it is trustworthy. It found numerous cases of the children being pumped for information about the whereabouts of the mother. This is something that anyone who is used to this business comes to expect, whereas those who like to keep it under the carpet are taken by surprise every time.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para9"></a>I do not know the number of cases there have been in the past 10 years of women murdered when they are traced by violent former husbands through contact, but I believe that it is quite a large number. There was one I remember a few years back that was quite widely publicised, which took place in the forecourt of New Street station in Birmingham. Publicity is no deterrent once a man gets desperate enough.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para10"></a>Sixty of the 127 refuges said that they knew of cases in their area where a violent man had been able to use court proceedings to track down his former partner. I speak of cases since 19th June 2000. It is a fairly large number of cases. One case was reported in which a man followed his former partner home after a contact visit, broke into her house and stabbed her. Fortunately she survived, but I gather that this was only just.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para11"></a>I know that the Lord Chancellor's Department is familiar with the case of Georgina McCarthy, about which my honourable friend Mr George did a great deal of work. That is one where the tracing was done through letters from medical professionals who, if they are not thinking about the issue and not culturally awake to it, do not always take the sort of precaution that they would normally take if they knew what they were dealing with.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para12"></a>Thirty refuge projects said they knew of cases of women who had been ordered to hand over their children for contact visits even though the woman had previously been warned by social services that the <P>


<a name="column_GC335"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children could be taken into care if she did not separate from the man concerned. That sounds like a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para13"></a>Eight refugees said they knew of women who had been ordered to hand over their children for contact visits although the father or stepfather was a Schedule 1 offender, convicted of cruelty to that particular child. Here again, the left hand does not seem to know what the right is doing.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para14"></a>Forty-five knew of cases where an abused woman had been threatened with sanctions to force her to comply with a contact order. It really is no use threatening the woman, even if it were morally justifiable, because there are plenty of cases, some of them known to me, where however many times you threaten the mother, even if you imprisoned her, the child would not go. In fact, if you imprisoned the mother, all the more the child would not go; the child would probably never go.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para15"></a>Punishing people for other people's actions is in all cases judicially wrong; this is something that must stop. Forty-nine abused women were threatened that residence would be granted to their ex-partners and 36 were threatened with imprisonment. Between 45 refuge projects, they were aware of 128 abused women and 259 children who had been forced to comply with a contact order since 19th June 2000. That surely establishes that the scale of the problem is considerable. It also establishes that not all authorities that deal with it are awake to it and, further, that it is a real danger to the safety of those involved.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para16"></a>What the precaution against it needs to be is not something on which I would wish to be dogmatic. There must, however, be a culture in which it is recognised that you do not hand people over into danger without, at the very least, their own consent. That is something that could be taken on board.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para17"></a>This does not mean that every man who has been violent is necessarily always a danger. There are such things as cure and treatment, though they are not common. I am, however, saying that where there is a known danger, that danger must be weighed up and assessed, very much in the way demanded by Amendment No. 107ZB, before the child and the mother are left to the tender mercies of somebody they have no reason to trust. I hope that something is going to be done about this because it has gone on long enough.

<P>
<A NAME="20715-41_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I rise to support these amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in particular made a powerful case for Amendment No. 107ZA. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, will doubtless tell us about the court procedures that exist or may be amended following consultation. I was grateful for her letter of 25th June which set out much of this in very helpful detail.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para18"></a>However, I am far from convinced that leaving the law unamended and resting merely on guidelines is an adequate solution. We know that guidelines are not <P>


<a name="column_GC336"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>always enough to protect children, which is why, for example, the Government have introduced the welfare principle into the Education Bill, where there is to be a duty on schools to report abuse. That is because the Government knew that guidelines would not be enough.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para19"></a>I am particularly concerned to see that subsection (3) of Amendment No. 107ZA is enacted. We know that, especially where very young children are involved, it is difficult to prove ill treatment or abuse. We also know that domestic violence predominantly affects women with very young children. I am not going to enter the debate on the precise effects of In Re H & R, which has already been discussed. It is my understanding that that has raised the evidential burden too high and we have to take this legislative opportunity to put the child's welfare at the forefront of proceedings. I hope the Government will look favourably on these amendments.

<A NAME="20715-41_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I support Amendments Nos. 107ZA and 107ZB. Listening to the noble Earl, I am reminded of something TS Elliott said: that man cannot bear too much reality. Sometimes some things are too hard to think about and reading about the performance of the judiciary in this area, I have concerns that sometimes the reality has not been properly acknowledged and has not been addressed. Having said that, I feel very reassured that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, is managing this area. I know how well respected she is with her experience in child protection, which I find helpful, and I was grateful for her earlier full reply.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para20"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred to the circumstances in which some women are threatened with prison sentences for not allowing contact to their children. Surely in those circumstances, can there be any reason why there should not be a full report by a guardian and representation for the children in at least those particular cases? We would then know what was in the best interests of the child, whatever the mother or the father wished.
<P>

<a name="20715-41_para21"></a>I wonder whether the noble Baroness might furnish us with a date for the publication of the report into the inquiry on the 15 deaths through contact, perhaps not now but some time in the course of our proceedings. I am sure that it would be very helpful in our deliberations at the next stage of the Bill to have access to that report.

<A NAME="20715-42_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   If my noble friend the Minister replies to both of these amendments, perhaps I may say a few words about Amendment No. 107ZB, which is a partner amendment to the one I proposed. It is based on the definition of domestic violence contained within the New Zealand Domestic Violence Act 1885. In its report to the Lord Chancellor on the question of parental contact in cases where there is domestic violence, the Children Act sub-committee commented that in its view Section 3 of the New Zealand Domestic Violence Act provides a very useful, comprehensive, gender-neutral definition, which I would urge upon the Government.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para0"></a>This amendment suggests that court professionals who do not always understand the nature of domestic violence&#151;as many Members of the Committee have already commented&#151;are likely to make decisions which put abused women and children in danger.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We have obviously listened very carefully to what all Members of the Committee have said in relation to this issue. We take on board very clearly the need to recognise the interests of children in this regard and to put their safety as paramount. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, made reference to my own experience. In the 22 years that I operated in this field, from 1977 to 1999, we had extensive opportunity to discuss these matters with the judiciary, both at the Bar and otherwise. These issues have been trammelled for many years, and the importance of keeping a balance between the need to preserve contact while ensuring that the provisions one is making for the children are safe, has exercised judicial minds throughout this whole period.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para1"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, spoke of a change in culture in relation to domestic violence. It is right that in the 1960s and 1970s, there was, perhaps, a reluctance to acknowledge the part that domestic violence played, and also a tendency to see it occurring only in certain strata of society.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para2"></a>We know that abuse, whether it is verbal, physical or sexual, occurs in all parts of society and is no respecter of persons, race, culture, income, or anything else. I could not let the Committee go away with the feeling that we have not moved forward. We have moved forward considerably in this area in trying to take the steps which are necessary to keep children safe.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para3"></a>Therefore, it is no longer the case that domestic violence is an issue that we like to think about. Certainly, the professionals and courts dealing with it, regrettably, have to think of these issues all too often and they are taken seriously. Members of the Committee will know that provision is now being made that all judicial officers who undertake work in this area must have specific training in relation to child care issues before they are allowed to have a "family law ticket" which enables them to hear cases of this sort.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para4"></a>It is concerning to hear the comments made by my noble friend Lady Thornton, and noble Earls in relation to some of these cases. I would like to say to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that, at present we are consulting with those in relation to the specific cases. There is no date as far as I am aware in relation to the outcome. The Government have been made aware that a number of organisations have stated that they have details of cases in which it appears that contact has been ordered and where there has been a history of violence and a child has subsequently been harmed or even killed. We are working with these agencies to identify the cases concerned, to investigate whether or not these allegations are substantiated and, if so, what we can learn from the future. I cannot give the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC338"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Earl a timescale in relation to that, but if and when I am able to I will certainly communicate with him about that issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para5"></a>A point was raised by several Members of the Committee and in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on the enforcement of contact and what we do with it. Enforcement of contact is a very sensitive area. CASC (the Children Act Sub-Committee of the Advisory Board on the Family Law) is chaired by Mr Justice Ward, who is a member of the Family Division and has a specific expertise in this area. The report Making Contact Work, published on 8th February 2002, contains a large number of detailed recommendations, and the Government need to consider and will consider those very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para6"></a>The most important thing for us to do is to get this right. There are no quick fixes in this area. If we have learnt one thing by looking at the past 50 years, we know that. We must put children first, as Members of the Committee have said, and we must ensure that contact is safe. The Government are carefully considering the recommendations in the report and will publish a response in due course.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para7"></a>The New Zealand model has been much vaunted in this debate. Not surprisingly, the New Zealand situation is slightly different from our own; namely, the New Zealand model has a general presumption in favour of contact. New Zealand has therefore legislated to provide a rebuttal of that presumption; that the courts shall not make an order for contact or residence in favour of a violent parent, unless it is satisfied that the child will be safe.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para8"></a>We have no such presumption in favour. All we have, which we would suggest to noble Lords is a better way forward, is that the welfare of the child is to be the final determinant of what we do or do not do. Members of the Committee will know that we have to make those judgments on a case-by-case basis. What is good for child A may not be good for child B, and the court has to fashion and craft a solution which best fits the needs of that child in that family at that time. That is difficult to legislate in a confined way. We believe that the welfare of the child is the best test as opposed to having a presumption for or a presumption against. As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, the child is not a chattel. One does not receive the child as a gift; one is not refused contact as a punishment&#151;the child has its own right to have contact if that inures to the child's benefit.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 107ZA and 107ZB deal with the extremely important issue of protecting children from harm in the context of private law Children Act proceedings. As many Members of the Committee will know, private law proceedings under Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 are between individuals, often following separation or divorce, and include settling the arrangements for where a child lives or with whom a child has contact.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para10"></a>This is an area in which the Government have already shown that we have listened to stakeholders and Members in another place in order to improve protection for children. I thank my noble friend Lady <P>


<a name="column_GC339"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Thornton for the complimentary remarks that she made about that. During the passage of this Bill in the other place the Government tabled two amendments which were accepted on Report. The first, included as Clause 116 of your Lordships' version of the Bill, amends the Children Act to clarify the definition of harm in the Act to make clear that harm includes any harm a child may suffer or is at risk of suffering as a result of witnessing the ill-treatment of another person.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para11"></a>I can reassure Members of the Committee that the current definition of harm in the Children Act already includes direct harm, violence to or abuse of a child. This amended definition of harm builds on that to put beyond doubt the fact that it also includes harm sustained by indirect means, by witnessing either domestic violence or violence which may not be domestic but which may nevertheless have affected the child, for example because he or she has seen a parent continually involved in brawls or intimidating neighbours or others.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para12"></a>The Government's second amendment to Clause 1(4)(e) applied the same definition of harm to proceedings under the Adoption and Children Bill. At present a court, when deciding whether or not to grant contact between a parent and child, is under a duty to have regard to the welfare checklist in the Children Act. This includes whether a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering any harm.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para13"></a>During the Special Standing Committee in the other place, a number of children's charities and organisations representing the victims of violence expressed concern that not enough account was being taken of the impact on children of domestic violence. Clause 116 therefore makes absolutely clear that when a court is deciding whether or not to grant contact between a parent and a child, the court will be obliged to decide whether domestic violence has taken place and, if so, its present and possible future impact on the child.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para14"></a>Amendment No. 107ZA, tabled by my noble friend Lady Thornton, would impose a requirement on the court to determine whether an allegation of ill-treatment on the child or on another person is proved as soon as practicable. Such a requirement already exists in Section 1(2) of the Children Act and is also addressed by the guidelines on parental contact with children where there is domestic violence produced by the Children Act sub-committee of the Lord Chancellor's advisory board on family law. The guidelines provide direction to courts and CAFCASS officers on the key considerations when dealing with contact cases in which allegations of domestic violence have been made. The guidelines are for courts and CAFCASS and all those involved in contact cases where domestic violence is an issue.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para15"></a>Guideline 1.5 stresses the importance of the court making a finding of fact as to whether domestic violence has occurred and, if so, the impact on the child. The court will then need to consider whether any contact ordered must be subject to conditions, for example, that it should be supervised.
<P>


<a name="column_GC340"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para16"></a>The guidelines have been partially incorporated into case law through the court of Court of Appeal case of In Re L and others, in June 2000. The guidelines have been distributed and are being incorporated into judicial training and evaluated through monitoring and research.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para17"></a>In endorsing the guidelines on 6th March, the Government undertook to carry out regular surveys to gauge their usage and effectiveness. The first survey on the use and effectiveness of guidelines was carried out last November. An analysis was laid in Parliament on 13th March 2002. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Russell, looked at that research.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para18"></a>That was a very important opportunity for us as it gave some very useful information. It indicated that use and awareness of the guidelines was patchy, which was an important thing for us to know. We are working with all those in the family justice system to ensure that the guidelines are brought to as wide an audience as possible&#151;for example, through exercises such as the launch, on 7th March 2002, of the Law Society's family law protocol, and as part of the Government's work to tighten up the court rules in this area&#151;and to ensure consistency of practice both in terms of findings of fact and of conditions to ensure safety.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para19"></a>The Government are seeking to address many of the criticisms that the noble Earl, Lord Russell raised. For example, in partnership with the President of the Family Division, and with other stakeholder groups such as the WAFE and the NSPCC, we are reviewing 1.3 of the guidelines, which deals with the findings of fact. We are also working in partnership with the voluntary sector to develop a national network for child contact centres.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para20"></a>Moreover, a second survey on the guidelines is currently under way. I can tell the Committee that we are already getting much more positive messages in the second survey than we did in the first. So the guidelines seem to be seeping their way through the system. As I have outlined, the main findings of the survey are that, where the guidelines are being used, they are judged as being effective. However, distribution of the guidelines has not been as thorough as the Government would like.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para21"></a>The judiciary and the legal profession, and organisations representing children and victims of violence, are currently been consulted on amendments to the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 which would strengthen the court rules to give additional force to the guidelines. This would give greater flexibility to add to, or amend, the obligation on the court. Subsection (2) of this amendment labels the person who has inflicted ill treatment on a child, or another person, as an abusive party, and then seeks to preclude the court from making an order for residence, or unsupervised contact, in favour of an abusive party unless the court is satisfied that the child will be safe.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para22"></a>The Children Act is already underpinned by the fundamental principle that the welfare of the child is paramount, and presumptions which gloss or interfere with this will simply create confusion. There is no <P>


<a name="column_GC341"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>presumption in primary legislation in favour or against contact, and the welfare principle guides the courts in the individual case. I see no reason to undermine or amend this fundamental principle.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para23"></a>The amendment also specifies that the court shall not make an order for residence or contact in favour of an abusive party unless the court is satisfied that the child will be safe. This is the obligation already imposed by the Children Act. Section 1(3) of the Act requires the court to consider not only the harm a child has suffered, but the harm that he is at risk of suffering before it makes an order for contact or residence. The court has the power under Section 11(3) of the Children Act to attach conditions to orders, such as that the contact should be supervised. In addition, it would make orders for the protection of a child or a parent even if no application had been made, such as the non-molestation order.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para24"></a>Subsection (3) of the amendment states that where in Section 8 of the Children Act proceedings a court is unable to determine whether an allegation is proved, but the court is satisfied that there was a risk of harm, the court is permitted to make an order under the Children Act 1989 when that is considered necessary to protect the child. Again, this provision is unnecessary as Section 1 of the Children Act already mandates the courts to consider the range of powers available to them under the Act.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para25"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 107ZB, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. This amendment would require a court to have regard to a checklist whenever it is determining whether a child would be safe if contact or residence is granted. As I said earlier, when deciding whether to grant contact between a parent and a child, or to make a residence order, the court is already under a duty to have regard to the welfare checklist in the Children Act, which includes whether a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering any harm. The Children Act makes the welfare of the child the court's paramount concern.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para26"></a>This amendment seeks to set out criteria which the court is required to consider whenever allegations of ill treatment are made in an application for a contact or residence order. While I understand the principle of what is proposed, the fact is that the Children Act 1989 already provides the court with the statutory powers it needs to protect children at risk.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para27"></a>The Government understand all these concerns. As I am conscious of the time, I should like to state a shortened version of our position. We understand the concerns of noble Lords and what they are trying to achieve. The short answer is that all those concerns are already covered in current legislation and in the guidance provided by the rules. What the Committee is really exercised about is not so much the law&#151;the Sections&#151;but how it is practised, how it is exercised and the exercise of judicial discretion. To speak boldly, if we amended the law exactly as the Committee would like&#151;reiterating what is already there in statute&#151;one would have to ask: how would that change in practice what is happening on the ground?
<P>


<a name="column_GC342"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para28"></a>Bearing in mind that we already have the necessary provisions on the statute book, what is important is to improve the practice. Thus, the steps that we have taken are to ensure that every judge, every magistrate and every person who will have to exercise this discretion will have the appropriate training to enable them to discharge their duty responsibly, so that there is joined-up working between the agencies to create an appropriate safety net for the children. Those are what are going to make the real difference.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para29"></a>I do not decry for a moment the impulse that causes noble Lords to seek to make these amendments. However, if we go them line by line, which I would be very happy to do, we would find that almost everything that noble Lords seek is already enshrined in legislation.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para30"></a>I can certainly empathise with the concerns expressed. We shall look into the important issues raised by noble Lords. We shall look as creatively as we can at how better to enhance practice. However, if everyone was doing that which the statute currently exhorts, then many of the concerns that we have today expressed would not have had to be expressed as they would already be covered.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para31"></a>I can certainly reassure the Committee, therefore, that both the Department of Health and the Lord Chancellor's Department take these matters extremely seriously. We shall take every opportunity to ensure that the safety of children is not only preserved but greatly enhanced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-42_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   On a point of clarification, as I understand it, one of the reasons why the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, is unwilling to accept the proposed amendments is that she wants to look at the welfare needs of the child in each case and respond appropriately to those welfare needs. If I have understood the noble Baroness correctly, she does not wish to believe that this mechanism is too awkward to achieve that aim. I shall give her an opportunity to correct me in a moment.
<P>

<a name="20715-42_para32"></a>There is a great deal of concern about the specific instance in which a mother is in threat of being put in prison for not allowing contact with her child. I should be grateful to the Minister if she could give some further guidance in that area as to what she would expect the courts to do in that situation. In such circumstances, would the noble Baroness expect a guardian to be appointed and a solicitor to be called in for the child so that the interests of the child were made very clear? I suppose it is a question of the good practice about which the noble Baroness was speaking earlier. However, it would be most helpful if she could offer some further information at this point.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-43_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I was hoping to make clear, first, that the guiding principle for our court is what is in the best interests of the child; in other words, the welfare of the child. That will take into account a multiplicity of issues&#151;for example, the harm that might be caused to a child, the risk of harm, the child's views, and the conditions in which the child may be <P>


<a name="column_GC343"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>looked after either by the mother or the father. These are all issues that the court has to balance as regards what is in the overall best interests of the child. It has to consider whether contact will be possible, and whether it can be undertaken safely.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para0"></a>What I am saying is that one cannot have a presumption in favour of one or a presumption in favour of the other, because these are matters which the court will have to weigh on a case-by-case basis. There is already opportunity, if the court deems it appropriate, to have a CAFCASS officer report. The CAFCASS officer, in exercising his or her duty, will not only have to take into account what the child has to say but will also have to consider whether this is an appropriate case for the child to be separately represented, bearing in mind the child's age, maturity, and the other circumstances. So all of those issues will be balanced.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para1"></a>That imposes a duty on the CAFCASS officer. All the issues in relation to the importance of domestic violence, as well as those that have been raised in Committee about the possible consequences for the child, are issues that the CAFCASS officer should take into account before and during making the report. Therefore, when the report is presented to the court, it will outline the circumstances that the CAFCASS officer found to be proven&#151;the circumstances regarding the mother's home and the father's home, what the child said when interviewed, what his or her feelings and views were&#151;and an expression as to whether the child should or should not be separately represented.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para2"></a>On reading a CAFCASS officer's report, it is always possible for the court to say, of its own volition, "We think that this is case that would merit some form of other intervention"&#151;that is to say, one that would merit legal representation, or separate representation, for the child. This is an interactive process. The court is not just simply a repository for the information that the CAFCASS officer gives. If something in that report needs further interrogation, the court has an opportunity to ask for that further interrogation to take place, and/or to ask for the child to be separately represented as the need arises.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para3"></a>It has to be the appropriate case, because many private law cases do not involve abuse of the children; they do not involve issues of this sort. Regrettably, however, a small percentage do and those cases cause acute difficulty and much anguish. On behalf of the members of the judiciary who do this work, I should point out that they take this very seriously. Members of the Committee should be left in no doubt about the distress that is occasioned when mistakes are made. For all those occasions when fathers or mothers behave in a wholly inappropriate and sometimes heinous way, one has to balance it against the thousands of cases that the same judge may have heard <P>


<a name="column_GC344"></a>

<B>15 Jul 2002 : Column GC344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and made judicial decisions upon which have not had such an unhappy outcome. It is a difficult balance and it is a tragedy when that balance goes wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   At the outset I thank the Minister for the enormously thoughtful and detailed way she has responded to this amendment. I am very grateful indeed for everything she said and the detail in which she has chosen to approach the different issues that have been raised during the debate. Indeed, the debate, although taken at the tail end of the Committee, has done credit to the issue about which we feel so strongly.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para4"></a>I want to make only one or two brief comments. I have written down a few issues which cause me concern and we shall probably need to pursue them at a later stage. One is about the balance referred to by my noble friend. We do not believe that the balance is right, and that is why these amendments have been tabled and why we want to have this discussion with the Government. We believe the balance is not right because case law is not helping to resolve these issues in the courts. Furthermore, as the Minister explained, the guidelines are not being followed in a thorough and a proper fashion throughout.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para5"></a>The second issue relates to guidelines. At present, those of us who are concerned about this very important issue believe that the guidelines are not sufficient in themselves because they are guidelines. That is the other issue we may well need to follow up.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para6"></a>My final point relates to a word used by the Minister; she spoke of the guidelines "seeping" through the system. That is not an adequate or satisfactory expression for what is such an important issue, because children's lives are at risk here and, indeed, may have been lost.
<P>

<a name="20715-43_para7"></a>The Minister placed great emphasis on the guidelines and I have looked at them and at their monitoring. However, they are not doing their job. It is not because they are inadequate&#151;they are very good but could probably be improved&#151;but because they are not being implemented. That is the problem and that is the crux of what we will need to return to, but I am grateful to everyone who took part in the debate, not least the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20715w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Moynihan  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress they will seek to make in the global fight against terrorism at the forthcoming GB summit in Kananaskis.[HL4527]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  The summit was an important opportunity to take stock of progress in the fight against terrorism since 11 September and to set priorities for future action in a number of key areas.
<P>

<a name="20715w01_para0"></a>In particular, the UK was concerned to counter the threat of terrorist acquisition of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological materials in the former Soviet Union, especially Russia, where the world's largest stocks of such materials remain. Our priorities were the destruction of chemical weapons, the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear submarines and the employment of former weapons scientists. GB leaders agreed at Kananaskis to launch the new Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction to help ensure that deadly materials cannot fall into the hands of terrorist groups. The G8 agreed collectively to raise up to 20 billion dollars over the next 10 years to fund projects under the global partnership. As part of the this programme, the UK plans to commit up to 750 million dollars spread over <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the next decade. The summit saw similar pledges made by other countries and the start of a dialogue with Russia over how best to implement this programme.
<P>

<a name="20715w01_para1"></a>G8 officials have worked since March on a plan to ensure the greater security of international transport, with strong UK support. G8 members continue to work through international fora such as the ICAO and the IMO to encourage others to put in place appropriate transport security measures to guard against terrorism. Leaders agreed at the summit on the Co-operative G8 Action on Transport Security, a plan of action to promote enhanced security of land, sea and air transport while facilitating the cost-effective and efficient flow of people, cargo and vehicles for legitimate economic and social purposes.
<P>

<a name="20715w01_para2"></a>The UK is leading co-ordination of international anti-narcotics assistance to Afghanistan. The G8 discussed the UK's anti-narcotics strategy paper and action plans for combating poppy growing in Afghanistan. As we had hoped, agreement was reached that the G8 would step up efforts to assist the Afghan Government combat opium production and trafficking and fulfil Tokyo conference commitments. Breaking Afghan dependence on the drugs trade will help reconstruction efforts, but the wider impact will be in securing regional stability and cutting one of the cash lifelines that allows terrorists to thrive.

<A NAME="20715w01_wqn4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Whether the decrease in the number of pupils who have special educational needs statements and who have been permanently excluded from schools is linked to a downward trend in the number of statements being issued.[HL5107]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  The latest published (final) figures show that the number of pupils with statements in England rose from 252,857 in January 2000 to 258,200 in January 2001 (estimates). The number of children for whom statements were issued for the first time in the calendar year 2000 was 33,746 compared to 35,421 in the calendar year 1999.
<P>

<a name="20715w01_para3"></a>During a comparable period, the permanent exclusion rate for pupils with statements of SEN in the academic year 2000&#150;01, an estimated 0.3 per cent, was three times as high as that for pupils without statements. The rate in 1999&#150;2000 was six times as high.
<P>

<a name="20715w01_para4"></a>Changes to the underlying data collections will, however, affect year-on-year comparability of these rates, but they do present some evidence that the rate of exclusion for pupils with statements has reduced compared with the previous year. We are looking into this. There could be a number of factors involved. We have no evidence at present to suggest that the fall in the rate of exclusions of children with statements is linked to the reduced number of new statements issued.

<A NAME="20715w02_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the apparent decrease in the number of statements issued and in early identification and assessment of special educational needs are contributory factors in the sharp increase (19 per cent) in the number of primary school pupils being permanently excluded.[HL5108]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  The latest published (final) figures show that the number of pupils with statements in England rose from 252,857 in January 2000 to 258,200 in January 2001 (estimates). The number of children for whom statements were issued for the first time in the calendar year 2000 was 33,746 compared to 35,421 in the calendar year 1999, However, the number of new statements issued for children under five, for example, increased from 6,363 during the calendar year 1999 to 6,518 in the calendar year 2000.
<P>

<a name="20715w02_para0"></a>There could be a range of factors accounting for the 19 per cent increase in the number of primary age pupils being excluded from school during the academic year 2000&#150;01, the comparable period. We are looking at possible factors but have no evidence at present to suggest that the increase is linked to the number of new statements issued.
<P>

<a name="20715w02_para1"></a>A statutory framework is in place to ensure that local education authorities and schools identify and assess children with special educational needs as early as possible and guidance on this is provided in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. The current version came into force in January 2002 and places a greater emphasis on early identification, both during the early years and at every stage of a child's schooling. A &#163;25 million package has been put in place in support of SEN in the early years, including support for establishing SEN co-ordinators in early years education settings and area SENCOs, with a target of one area SENCO for every 20 non-maintained settings by 2004. This is in addition to the &#163;113.5 million being provided over the period 2001 to 2004 to improve the knowledge and skills of staff involved in government-funded early years education, which will include SEN training.

<a name="20715w02_para2"></a>It is relevant to point out that, although scrapie was made legally notifiable in 1993, there was no payment of compensation to farmers for the slaughter of sick animals until this Government introduced such a measure in 1998. The levels of compensation to farmers were significantly increased in December 2001.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>  The current arrangements for paying compensation for all animal diseases have become fragmented over time and are somewhat complex. I am considering how compensation arrangements can be rationalised so as to simplify the whole approach. It will be some time, probably autumn, before we announce a decision on how we intend to take work on this policy area forward. We will, of course, in time consult widely on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w02_wqn5"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the cost of redundancy payments with the transfer of functions from health authorities to primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.[HL5091]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Several thousand staff from health authorities and regional offices of the Department of Health transferred employment into primary care trusts and the new health authorities on 1 April 2002. Staff are currently being appointed into substantive posts in the new organisations based on their previous experience and skills. The human resources framework covering these changes set out as one of its key principles that every effort would be made to avoid redundancies in order to ensure that valuable skills and experience were not lost to the service. As a result, all staff affected have been guaranteed employment for a 12 month period ending 31 March 2003. It is expected that the majority will be found suitable alternative employment during that period but it is not possible at this stage to predict how many staff will be unable to find a suitable post. The redundancies which have taken place so far are among the former health authority chief executives. The provisional position here is that health authorities estimate that, at today's prices, they are liable to pay out about &#163;12.5 million in respect of chief executives' severance costs. Final figures for the totality of the changes will not be available until after 31 March 2003.

<A NAME="20715w02_wqn6"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether conditions apply whereby National Health Service employees receiving a redundancy payment have to repay any moneys in the event of taking other National Health Service employemnt.[HL5092]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Redundancy payments to National Health Service employees are governed by an agreement of the General Whitley Council. Under that agreement employees are not entitled to a redundancy payment if (a) they obtain suitable alternative employment with the same or another NHS employer within four week of the date of the termination of the contract or (b) unreasonably refuse to accept or apply for suitable alternative employment with the same or another NHS employer. Before payment is made employees are required to undertake to refund the redundancy payment if these conditions are not satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20715w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has an implementation committee that has been working to define standards of political and economic governance and design a peer review mechanism to uphold them. They are not specific to Zimbabwe but are part of a long-term African agenda to achieve peace and security, uphold human rights and improve political and economic governance. These are not commitments that were entered into at the G8 summit but are specific to NEPAD. The G8 summit agreed to an action plan for Africa, which has been placed in the House Libraries.
