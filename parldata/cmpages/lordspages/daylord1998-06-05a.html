<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para0"></a>It has come to the attention of the Scottish Office that there is a deficiency in the law regulating independent sector residential and day care establishments in Scotland. The result is that certain establishments providing care and support for certain vulnerable groups are not in fact subject to regulatory controls in accordance with policy intentions. The proposed Bill seeks to restore the policy intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para1"></a>Residential and day care homes are provided by local authorities and by the independent sector. These are either in the private sector or provided by voluntary organisations. The policy intention since the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 was enacted has been that the relevant homes in the independent sector which deal directly with the public should be regulated through registration with the appropriate local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para2"></a>However, an insertion into the 1968 Act by the Registered Establishments (Scotland) Act 1987 had the perverse effect of limiting the policy intention only to relevant independent sector homes which provide their services to clients of a local authority. In other words, those homes which deal directly with the public and do not provide services to local authorities are not in law required to register.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para3"></a>It is difficult to estimate with precision how many establishments may be affected, but we believe the figure is in the region of 140 establishments covering residential care homes and children's homes and, it is thought, a small number of independent schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para4"></a>The primary concern is that the law as it now stands is such that a number of homes for vulnerable people do not have the statutory protection of registration. This flies in the face of this Government's, and for that matter the previous Government's, stated intention of providing as much protection for these vulnerable people as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para5"></a>It is therefore considered essential to plug this gap without delay. The most appropriate vehicle for achieving this in the circumstances is by a Private Member's Bill. That is the procedure which I am using this morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para6"></a>Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.--(Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld.)

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-01_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, the Bill can be given a welcome. It brings registration with and inspection by the local authority, it is to be hoped, to all <P>


<a name="column_590"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 590</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>establishments in Scotland where people are accommodated and cared for. It also extends the scheme of voluntary registration to establishments which offer no or minimal personal care or support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para7"></a>I wish to make several observations about the operation of the Bill. First, it tampers with the most significant piece of legislation from my student days--the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para8"></a>Secondly, a close examination of the Bill and its legislative background identifies that this is the fourth time that Section 61 has been altered and improved. Tracing the amendments proposed by the Bill takes us through the Social Work Act, the Registered Establishments (Scotland) Act 1987, The Children (Scotland) Act 1995, and now this Bill. There is beginning to be a clear need for consolidation of these Acts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para9"></a>Thirdly, the Bill proceeded through another place in lamentable order. There was no consideration or scrutiny whatsoever as it went through all stages at 2.30 p.m. on Friday, 24th April. Hansard reports that the only person to speak was Mr. Deputy Speaker, who complained that the Bill was only published on the previous day. Considering the imminent return of the Scottish parliament, this is a fine example of how that unicameral parliament must not act when dealing with legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para10"></a>Fourthly, the Bill establishes regulation-making powers for the Secretary of State in respect of the extension of registration and inspection. However, these new duties fall to the 32 local authorities to implement. There is a risk that we shall see 32 different schemes of registration and inspection. For some of the smaller local authorities--this is my chance to mention Clackmannanshire--there will be very little scope for building up experience, due to lack of numbers. I wonder whether any consideration was given to altering the positioning of the registration and inspection function from local authorities to central government, as is the case with education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para11"></a>Fifthly, there will be a fear that the process will be prescriptive, with caricature marxist social workers running around altering the character of all establishments into their narrow image. Of course, my colleagues were never like that! I hope that the registration and inspection process will be conducted in a manner whereby the registration and inspection officer will satisfy him or herself that there is a comprehensive system of personal care and support in place and will record a description of exactly what it is. That would allow the process to be one of insistence on minimum standards and allowing for notices-to-remedy to be issued.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para12"></a>Sixthly, as noble Lords who followed the Committee stages of the Children (Scotland) Act will recall, and of Sections 34 and 35 in particular, considerable emphasis was put on the place of the chief social work officer or the Secretary of State to receive and investigate complaints about the conduct of private schools. This role of the local authority and the Scottish Office to act as a receiver of complaints in the last resort will be extended to all the new categories brought within the scheme by the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_591"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para13"></a>Seventhly, this Bill was heralded by the idea that it would bring old folks' homes for the wealthy into the registration scheme. That is rightly achieved by it. Wealth gives no more control over one's environment than reduced means, if one is incapacitated. Families will be afforded some assistance if their dottled relatives are being mistreated or exploited.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para14"></a>Eighthly, I want to bring some attention to what my noble friend Lady Linklater of Butterstone would have said had she been able to attend this debate. This is about an omission in the Bill. The Children (Scotland) Act brought about the registration and inspection of children's homes and residential schools. It provided for their registration within the terms of Sections 34 or 35. The former dealt with those categorised as children's homes, the latter as residential schools. My noble friend's complaint is that the school she founded, Butterstone, for educationally fragile mainstream pupils is wrongly categorised as conforming to Section 34, as a children's home, and hence being inspected by social work inspectors twice a year, but by education inspectors only once in 10 years. It is a pity that the Bill does not provide a correction to this anomaly, which would allow such a school to be inspected under Section 35 every four years, and hence as a school. Considering that the school takes its pupils through to Highers, it is clearly dealing with mainstream but vulnerable-to-bullying children. Perhaps some thought can be given to this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para15"></a>Finally, the Bill has a spin-off for all establishments which offer accommodation. They have to declare whether or not they offer personal care or support. The decision not to register could be seen as a business liability. This would be a declaration that no personal care or support is offered. Not only will this affect organisations like the Scottish Youth Hostel Association, outdoor centres which offer training and advice, housing associations and criminal justice organisations which run supported accommodation projects, but I imagine that few hotels, guesthouses or B&Bs would want to declare that they offered no personal care. I suspect that the boundary between registration and non-registration will be quite fluid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para16"></a>My Lords, despite these observations, I continue to welcome the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  My Lords, I, too, am delighted to be able to support this small but important Bill. The Government are grateful to my noble friend Lord Hogg for taking charge of the Bill and for his opening remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para17"></a>The Bill aims to deal with what has been described as a flaw in the law relating to the registration of certain establishments under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. I call it a flaw as what is set out in the 1968 Act, following amendment in 1987, is at variance with intended policy and accepted practice. This Bill seeks to bring the law into line with policies subscribed to by this Government and previous governments. My noble friend has already explained the background in more detail.
<P>


<a name="column_592"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 592</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para18"></a>I want to underline the importance of the registration and inspection procedures undertaken by local authorities. These are designed to ensure that establishments which are in the business of providing personal care are in fact providing good standards of care for their residents, most of whom are vulnerable people of some kind. We have a responsibility to ensure that our youngest and oldest are being properly cared for. Registration is a public indication that a particular establishment and its managers are fit for the purpose of properly looking after the people entrusted to their care.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para19"></a>Our concern today is that the law as it stands is such that approximately 140 residential care homes do not have the statutory protection of registration. This, as I have said, flies in the face of the stated intentions of this Government and the previous government of providing as much protection for these vulnerable people as is reasonably possible. It is essential therefore to take steps without delay.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para20"></a>Scottish Office officials are in discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Directors of Social Work about the arrangements which need to be made with the establishments affected. Authorities will need to scrutinise their records and will wish to make early contact with the establishments concerned. Thereafter, it will be necessary to make arrangements for them to be formally registered once the Bill reaches the statute book. We hope that these new registrations will be executed with the minimum of bureaucracy and inconvenience for all concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para21"></a>Before concluding, perhaps I may deal with one or two points made by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. I note and welcome his support for the proposal. First, as regards the debate in the other place, it is my understanding that the measure had all party support and that leaders of all parties gave approval.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para22"></a>As regards a review and consolidation of the legislation, if the noble Earl wishes to have a discussion with me or to write to me making a formal request for consolidation, I shall consider it as I do any other request. I should have thought that this would have been an ideal topic for the Scottish parliament to undertake early in its life.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para23"></a>We have in hand proposals to revise the 1968 Act as regards the provisions relating to registration and inspection. Guidance is in hand as part of our approach to improving the system and ensuring that there is no fragmentation and that authorities of all sizes apply the same criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para24"></a>I welcome the support and co-operation given already to this Bill by all parties in the other place. Not to support the Bill would be to risk the well being of those who most need our protection. The affected care-home owners would be disadvantaged by no longer being able to rely on the public confidence in their establishments which registration brings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-01_para25"></a>As my noble friend Lord Hogg made clear, this Bill should command your Lordships' full support in ensuring a safe passage through the House. That ought <P>


<a name="column_593"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>not to mean stifling debate; anything which prevents the Bill's progress would, I suggest, be of benefit to no one. I earnestly commend the Bill to the House.

However, I cannot promise that the same brevity will apply to the Scotland Bill which is shortly to be before the House. I am sure that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, whom I count among my friends in this House, will return to the matters that he raised and will take up the kind suggestion made by my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate that he write to him about consultation. I trust that the House will give the Bill a Second Reading.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para0"></a>This is a Bill of topicality and current interest. In recent weeks we have all experienced, both in urban and rural areas, the adverse impact of transport congestion and air pollution on the quality of our life. That is particularly damaging for people who suffer from respiratory illnesses. At this time of the year, in the summer, the impact of urban congestion and pollution is clear for anyone to see. Indeed, if you happen to be a jogger like myself or a hill walker, that clearly affects all of us as we try to exercise in air of low quality. That is part of the argument for the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para1"></a>At the outset I should like to state that the argument is not about being opposed to cars as a means of transport. The argument is about the more efficient use of cars by using them for the modes of journeys for which they are most appropriate. It certainly is not about attacking the motor manufacturing industry which employs, both globally and worldwide, one in seven of the workforce. That is particularly so in the regional economy of industrial south Wales and Deeside. The automotive industry and the car component industry are absolutely vital to the inward investment strategy pursued so effectively by the Welsh Development Agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para2"></a>The Bill is about trying to ensure that there is a clear approach to road transport in relation to an integrated transport strategy. We are awaiting with baited breath the publication of the White Paper in that respect. I do not expect my noble friend the Minister--and I look forward to hearing her reply to the debate--to reveal all that is in the document. However, the consultation document of last August, issued jointly by my right honourable friend in the other place Mr. Ron Davies and other transport Ministers, stated that, reducing the dependence on the car and lorry through providing <P>


<a name="column_594"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 594</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>genuine alternatives and promoting greater use of, and more, attractive public transport, together with safer walking and cycling, are central to achieving a more sustainable transport system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para3"></a>Therefore, the Government certainly support the principles of the Bill as indeed do a huge range of voluntary organisations and campaigning groups which are funded by government departments. I refer in particular to the "Going for Green" initiative established by the previous government, so ably headed by Professor Graham Ashworth with whom I am privileged to share some work within the Tidy Britain Group as chair of the Keep Wales Tidy consultative committee. The latter has recently produced the newsletter of the environment cities and sustainable communities project, called Working Together. In it is highlighted what would now be the fourth event of the "Don't Choke Britain" campaign, emphasising the importance of reducing traffic congestion and pollution, especially in cities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para4"></a>I am pleased to be able to tell the right reverend Prelate that there is a Christian ecology link contribution to this campaign and that all of us who are practising Christians are being urged to support "Car Free Sunday", which will take place on June 14th. I am certain that all of us who will be going to church, to chapel or indeed to any other place of worship on that day, will take note of that campaign.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para5"></a>I emphasise the latter because there is a voluntary element to this whole activity. We are talking about setting a target for reduction. The achievement of such a target is not merely a matter for government; it is a matter for the voluntary activity of all of us in trying to green our own practices and also in working with others within our communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para6"></a>I look forward to hearing the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, because I know of the great interest of the Liberal Party in the issue since the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1977, which concerned local authorities. That was a significant piece of legislation in that it made an important statement and was the first time that there had been a commitment to the reduction of traffic as part of legislation. That was supported by all political parties. Therefore, I look forward to hearing the response from the Opposition Front Bench. I say that because I know that the Bill had the support of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place--namely, Mr. Hague, the former Welsh Secretary--who took a great interest in transport policy when he was at the Welsh Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para7"></a>The reasons for the Bill are to continue the process of the 1997 Act in that, because it referred to local authorities, national roads--that is, trunk roads and motorways--were exempted. Of course, that could have the effect of moving traffic from local roads on to trunk roads. Similarly, the role of the Secretary of State had no place in the 1997 Act. However, this Bill, which has national targets for England, Scotland and Wales, fits in entirely with the Government's and my devolution policies. It also indicates quite clearly in the current situation, and prior to the establishment of the Scottish parliament and the Welsh national assembly, the fact that the Secretaries of State will have responsibility. The <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, along with the Welsh and Scottish Offices, will be able to participate in the development of those targets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para8"></a>In my view, public targets are an effective way to deal with the issue. I call in evidence the 20th report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. I should point out that I assured my noble friend the Minister that I would not read the whole of the document. However, the relevant sections are the commission's assessment of what it stated in its previous report in 1994. Indeed, it reiterates the objectives of transport policy. In particular, I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to paragraph 4.3 of Chapter 4 where the report states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The concept of setting national targets for modal shares has been criticised. It was central to the Eighteenth Report that transport policies must have both specific objectives and quantified targets, against which progress towards the objectives can be monitored and reviewed. Within that general approach, we remain convinced of the value of targets for modal shares in fostering a strategic approach to complex issues. Even where achieving particular targets lies outside the direct power of central government, they can provide important guidance to local authorities, transport operators, transport users and suppliers about the extent and direction of change required. Setting challenging targets can help stimulate new thinking about solutions to difficult problems. The proposals in the Eighteenth Report about specific targets were presented as subject to detailed evaluation and modification by government; we have not attempted to carry out that task ourselves in this review". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para9"></a>I believe that that paragraph summarises the importance of setting targets. I hope the Minister will confirm that it is certainly the intention of the Government to pursue that line so clearly set out by the Royal Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para10"></a>We face increased environmental and social costs from congestion. We face the negative impact of congestion on other economic activities. All the road traffic forecasts that I have seen forecast an increase of between 9 per cent and 15 per cent. in road traffic by the year 2000. The worst case scenario is a forecast increase of up to 80 per cent. by 2025. That is the context in which we must set our limited targets of reducing road traffic congestion and limiting the impact of road traffic on our environment. I emphasise that we are developing the thinking of the previous government. I refer to the former Secretary of State for the Environment, John Gummer, and the previous government's document on sustainable development, The UK Strategy, Cmnd Paper No. 24/26. I shall not quote from it although I am tempted to do so. John Gummer stated that a growing economy does not need ever growing traffic, and there is no longer any need to link economic growth with traffic growth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para11"></a>In a press release issued on 16th January 1997 John Gummer states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if ... we focus on the opportunities for gaining access with less movement, for maximising public transport and for exploiting new technology, we will be able to continue to meet our economic needs". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para12"></a>There is no argument that a continued increase in road traffic is the only way to secure further economic growth. Clearly some road schemes and some traffic movements are essential. However, judging by the number of traffic movements that are undertaken for <P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>short journeys, people's lives tend to be governed by the car rather than the other way around. Some 59 per cent. of car journeys in the UK are shorter than five miles and 25 per cent. are shorter than two miles. That, in itself, indicates a need to change our personal practices as well as a need for the broader framework that we seek in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para13"></a>The detail of the Bill is fairly straightforward in that its definition of road traffic excludes those wonderful vehicles which are adapted to carry more than eight passengers in addition to the driver. Therefore this Bill will encourage the use of forms of transport other than the private car. It is important to emphasise my next point with regard to the kind of areas in which I have lived all my life. The Bill emphasises the need for adequate provision of taxi services in rural and non-rural areas and the need to address the mobility needs of those with disabilities who may have difficulty in getting about without using private cars. The need for this Bill is urgent. The Bill addresses global and local needs in that it attempts to set targets to reduce the impact of road transport on our environment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the chairman of the Rail Freight Group and an adviser to ADTRANZ. I welcome the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, has emphasised its importance. I believe he mentioned forecasts of an increase in road traffic of up to 80 per cent. over 25 years. I believe that in the past few years the Government have revised their forecasts downwards slightly, but they still forecast an increase of perhaps 50 per cent. over 20 years. Whichever figure one chooses, it comprises an enormous increase.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para15"></a>However, my first problem with the Bill is that it seeks to place a duty on the Government to set targets for a reduction in road traffic. When one has a forecast of a 50 per cent. increase over 20 years, I am not sure whether a reduced increase would still count as a reduction. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, will clarify that when he speaks at the end of the debate. The noble Lord referred to the duties of local authorities with regard to the 1997 Act. I hope that the White Paper will propose ways of slowing the rate of increase or even stopping it by encouraging people to walk or cycle rather than drive, and of course by encouraging the use of rail freight. I always mention rail freight in transport debates. However, if we are to halt the increase immediately, bold and courageous measures will be needed. I believe it will be a long, slow process, whatever the Government are able to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para16"></a>We have discussed many of the measures that may or may not appear in the White Paper in this House and elsewhere almost ad nauseam. I shall not rehearse the arguments in detail today as regards a reduction in exhaust emissions. Like the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, I approve of the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. It is one of the most well-researched and readable <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>documents on this subject that I have read in the past 10 years. It warrants much study. Its contents are fairly frightening. I remember when my party was in opposition we took the then government to task on this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para17"></a>Many measures could be taken to reduce road traffic but they can be summed up in the need to reduce car use, as the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, has said. We hope that the Department of Transport's White Paper will give some positive leads in this direction. However, one could argue that over the past 20 years, other government departments have pursued policies which have encouraged car use. Hospitals have become fewer in number and larger, as have schools. Out-of-town supermarkets have been built. That is, of course, a planning matter for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I cannot use the word "customers" in respect of people who use hospitals but the policies I have just mentioned have resulted in people travelling greater distances. An enormous proportion of people who use hospitals do not have access to a car and have to use public transport. The same applies to schools. We have debated that matter on many occasions. As I said, people who often do not have access to a car have been forced to travel greater distances. Such policies have resulted in extremely good financial projections for other government departments. Hospitals and schools have been rationalised. However, no budget is allocated to help people reach schools and hospitals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para18"></a>I am not so rash as to propose amendments for the Committee stage, assuming we reach that stage, but it would perhaps be useful to seek to place a duty on the Secretary of State to have regard to the causes of road congestion and to consult with other departments of state to ensure that their plans do not exacerbate the situation. If the Government do not wish to set road traffic reduction targets, they can, of course, duck behind the provisions of Clause 2(2). I am sure they will not do that. Perhaps the White Paper will contain more details on this matter. It is quite clear to me that whatever measures the White Paper contains, the increase in road traffic will continue unless funds are made available to provide radical solutions. Those will cost money. It is important that any measures are supported by the public. The costs will fall on local authorities as well as central government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para19"></a>Recently I was sent the results of an interesting MORI poll which was carried out in May. It was commissioned by the Association of Train Operating Companies. I believe that the poll is objective. I shall summarise a few of its findings. The first is that 92 per cent. of people think that road congestion is a serious problem--presumably, 8 per cent. do not. That is fine. Secondly, 90 per cent. of people are willing to accept additional restrictions on cars in major cities to tackle congestion. That is a measure that appeals to me and I imagine to my noble friend the Minister. The figures indicate that 25 per cent. are more likely to vote for the Government if they introduce restrictions. That is nice! Also, 76 per cent. would be happy to see car use restricted if there were a better integrated transport system. That, of course, has to be defined. Moreover, 71 one per cent. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>support an extra tax on vehicles entering some urban areas--I hope that means a charge; there is subtle difference--so long as the money raised is used to improve the public transport (bus/rail) system. Finally, 67 per cent. are concerned with car pollution increasing children's health problems; and 57 per cent. with the impact of road congestion on the environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para20"></a>Nevertheless, a large number of cars users will say, "That's fine, but it doesn't apply to me". We have discussed that matter before, and I hope that we can get away with it by means of education and other measures. Those statistics are important in assessing the public's acceptance of traffic measures. They might encourage the Government to be robust in trying to introduce controls and come up with plans that genuinely can reduce traffic.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para21"></a>My final point is fundamental. It is crucial that the revenue from these charges, as I choose to describe them, for on-street parking, speeding, driving in bus lanes, and charges on congestion in the future--infringements of traffic regulations--are spent on improving public transport and other measures to reduce traffic. I hope that my noble friend will give me some assurance, whatever proposals are in the White Paper to that effect, that she and her colleagues have achieved continuity in relation to the precedent set by the London parking regime, whereby 100 per cent. of the revenue from fines, after administration, goes into public transport in London. I hope that that approach will be widened and that precedents can continue to be set. I very much support the Bill, and look forward to the Minister's reply.

<A NAME="80605-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas of Chilworth: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, has given a wide-ranging view as to what he believes the Bill might or might not do. However, his eloquent expressions left me feeling somewhat frustrated with the Bill. It is difficult to find a connection with any other measures currently being implemented. On its own, the Bill provides for no action at all. Indeed, the Secretary of State is relieved of the requirement to do anything, at least for some 18 months. One has the feeling that there is not as wide an appreciation of the enormous economic and social benefits that are enjoyed by the world generally, and ourselves in this country in particular, as a result of modern road transport systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-02_para22"></a>It is not merely a question of motor cars. It is a question of production and distribution of goods and services. Looking at the growth that has taken place in recent years, one can measure the connection between economic growth and a growth in transport. As the noble Lord, and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, suggested, one might reasonably expect the Government's White Paper on integrated transport policy to suggest some action. I look forward to discussing that in due course. It may suggest action to deal with what I acknowledge are the disbenefits of increased transportation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord can possibly help the House as to whether he has any interest to declare in the field of increasing motor transport.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas of Chilworth: </B>   My Lords, if I was not disposed to be friendly towards the noble Lord, I should say that that intervention was of some impertinence. In the 30 years that I have been in this House, I have never failed to declare an interest if it was appropriate. I think that may answer the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para0"></a>Fourteen months ago, under the guidance of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I argued during debates on the 1997 Act that we should not get very far with trying to fix charges without attempting to find solutions to the problems that give rise to them. It is fourteen months since the passage of that legislation, and what has happened? Nothing has happened other than the production of some guidelines, which are now under discussion. So we have not advanced very far, and this second Bill is now before the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para1"></a>There will be growth in vehicle ownership. Of that, we can be absolutely sure. I do not know the figures; I am not a prophet. I could certainly appreciate a lessening of usage if and when there is a reasonable alternative available, reasonably priced. However, although we have debated these matters at great length in this House over the years, I fear that the prospect remains rather remote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para2"></a>I am not as pessimistic as other commentators on the roads scene as to the disbenefits in terms of health, congestion and so on. I am not as pessimistic as the noble Lords, Lord Elis-Thomas and Lord Berkeley. I sincerely believe that advances in fuel technology, engine and exhaust designs, etc., will make a much greater impact on the transport scene over the next five, 10 and certainly 15 years, than we have seen in the previous comparable period. There will have to be much greater investment, not only by the automotive industry, but also by government. In so far as tax or charge systems are involved, such measures will encourage the automotive industry to accelerate its already advanced research and development programmes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para3"></a>Similarly, there has to be greater investment in road development systems. I do not necessarily refer to having more roads, but improving those that we have. There are enough management systems in place, so that given the will and the right kind of expenditure by local and national authorities, we can make far better use of the roads system. Equally, vehicle design, particularly in terms of telematics--on-board information systems and reciprocal sending systems from road management schemes--will improve the position. Noble Lords may feel that that is something of an over-simplification. We have debated the matter many times, and before the summer is over we shall be discussing it again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para4"></a>There are two matters in the Bill that I wish to address. Clause 2(3) states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State shall have regard to the adverse impacts of road traffic, including"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para5"></a>and a number of points are listed. We hear that the Bill is not an anti-vehicle Bill. It therefore seems odd to include in the Bill a regard for the adverse impacts <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>--many of which, incidentally, I believe to be perceived rather than real. Where are the positive implications, the beneficial impacts, to be considered? In any relationship there needs to be a balance. I should want to see something added to the Bill to ensure that those beneficial impacts receive some consideration, particularly the social impacts referred to, all of which have enhanced the quality of life for so many people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para6"></a>The Bill does not deal with any of the recent fiscal measures taken in the Budget, which have added considerably to costs, particularly of freight transport. In Clause 2(4)(a) and (b) there is no mention of the needs of industry. I should like to see an amendment to the Bill to ensure that the needs of commerce and industry are given consideration equal to that given to the provision of taxi services, although I do not know how one would provide taxi services in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para7"></a>I am lukewarm about the Bill, although I do not wish to impede its progress. Many people think it will be a good thing, and I am not against good things, but I do not feel it will make the kind of impact that is suggested.

<A NAME="80605-03_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, there is a general agreement that the policy to reduce traffic on the roads, to take traffic away from places where it does damage to the local environment and the amenity of local communities and to improve modal choice available for access to jobs and essential community services, is right. But it is my intention to provide a little food for thought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para8"></a>The Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 requires local authorities either to specify targets for reducing road traffic and traffic growth levels in their areas or to say why they consider it inappropriate to specify these targets. However, the Bill offers no framework to show how traffic reduction targets might be achieved. I should be interested to learn if there is to be any government commitment to the long-term funding that will be needed to develop good quality bus and train services, which are fundamental to reducing dependency on cars. Without doubt, most local authorities will be unable to afford the capital expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para9"></a>We have yet to see how the statutory requirements of the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 take their course. We also have to see how the White Paper on integrated transport sets the policy framework and the investment plans to address properly future traffic growth. In view of those two aspects--and I hope I am not being too simplistic--could not this Bill be considered as being slightly premature?

<P>
<A NAME="80605-03_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I have to apologise sincerely to the House for speaking in the gap, due to an administrative oversight on my part. If we are to be pedantic, I have to declare an interest as I am president of the Heavy Transport Association.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para10"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for introducing his Bill today and I rise briefly to make comment upon it. The tenor of the Bill assumes that all road traffic is negative. My noble friend Lord Lucas touched on that point, and I agree with his view. Road <P>


<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>traffic is directly linked to economic activity. That is perhaps one reason why it is such a convenient and even appropriate target for the Government to raise tax revenues to support its spending plans. While there are some rather weak arguments presented regarding empty running of goods vehicles, generally speaking, goods vehicle traffic reflects economic activity. Therefore, if the Government succeeded in reducing goods vehicle traffic, they would have done so by creating a recession, or even a depression. Of course, if the Government reduced private car use, they would have created a miracle!
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para11"></a>At Clause 2(3)(g), the Bill refers to the adverse social impacts. I do not really understand what those are. There certainly are social benefits of road traffic, a point upon which my noble friend Lord Lucas also touched.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para12"></a>One argument with which I heartily agree is that, as more roads are built, so traffic increases. I am as guilty as anyone, as my domestic and work arrangements would be impractical without the road network that has been built over the past 20 years. Equally, I have confidence that the Minister herself, when authorising any road scheme, will always have regard to the "adverse impacts" listed in Clause 2(3).
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para13"></a>My main concern is that the Bill seeks to introduce targets for road traffic reduction in order to reduce the "adverse impacts". Surely it would be better to have targets to reduce the adverse impacts themselves. Most of these can be measured, apart from the social impact that I have already touched upon. The noble Lord may wish to draw my attention to Clause 2(3), but, if he does so, he may be exposing opportunities for improving the construction of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para14"></a>Finally, the Bill addresses an extremely important issue, as we know that the projections for traffic growth and congestion represent a nightmare, but this will be a key issue in the Government's integrated transport review. We look forward to the Minister's right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister settling his differences with the rest of the Cabinet and the publication of the White Paper. No doubt there will be a major Bill to follow and I believe that, if this matter is not covered, the Bill could be amended to do that.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, in welcoming this Bill, I begin by saying that it and its predecessor, as the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, said, has always had the support in Parliament of my noble friends in your Lordships' House and our honourable friends in another place. In fact, it was Don Foster who steered the 1997 Bill through the House of Commons. In a new policy document, which I helped to launch yesterday, we commit ourselves to a 1 per cent. annual reduction in traffic. That compares with the current rate of increase of 2 per cent. a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para15"></a>Everyone knows that road traffic is increasing. The congestion that it brings in its wake is an increasingly unpleasant factor in our daily lives. Road traffic is also a major contributor to the air pollution which damages our health. These are real problems, not merely perceived ones.
<P>


<a name="column_602"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 602</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para16"></a>I shall not deal at length with the question of pollution, which has been widely discussed here and elsewhere. In fact, I shall not deal at length with anything. However, I wish to make some comments about congestion. Congestion makes our streets more threatening and less pleasant for local residents and pedestrians. A recent BMA report shows that heavy traffic keeps people in their homes and reduces the sense of local community. It is dangerous. The director of the Child Health Monitoring Group at Great Ormond Street hospital stated recently that traffic volume is by far the most important risk factor for child pedestrian safety. Deterred by those two factors, parents prefer to take their children to school by car rather than let them walk, whether alone or accompanied. Congestion breeds more congestion. Nationally one in 10 trips by car is a school run.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para17"></a>Congestion is also expensive, costing, so the CBI has estimated, &#163;19 billion per year. For comparison purposes, that is more than three times the projected cost of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. And Transport 2000 estimates that there are a further &#163;6.3 million of costs which could be added through lost days at work and other costs of road accidents.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para18"></a>Unlike pollution, congestion cannot be tackled by purely technical means. We can hope and expect that alternative fuels and lean burn vehicles may make a considerable contribution to the reduction of pollution--the sort of thing to which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred. But there is no magic solution which can leave our travel habits intact and which will also solve the problems of congestion in towns, villages, on trunk routes or in lesser roads in the country. Determined action is required, led at a national level.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para19"></a>We already have a good idea of what that action might and should comprise. It should include changes in planning law to reduce the need to travel. A second aspect would be the reallocation of existing road space to give more room to buses, cyclists and pedestrians. Reference has already been made to the fact that three-fifths of all car trips are less than five miles in length and one-third of all trips are less than one mile. Those and other measures, such as safe routes to school, could impact significantly on the level of traffic in built-up areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para20"></a>We need to use a carrot and stick approach to persuade people to use public transport more often. We believe that those measures should include a direction of funds from charges on non-residential parking, traffic fines and possibly road charges to improve public transport and other methods of reducing traffic. In response to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, who made reference to the social aspects of the issue, any improvement made in the safety of roads for walkers, cyclists and pedestrians and to improve public transport would be of enormous benefit to that one-third of the population who do not own and do not have access to a car.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para21"></a>Within that approach, national targets for traffic reduction have an important part to play, despite what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, in what we hope will be a satisfactory White Paper and the policies which will <P>


<a name="column_603"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 603</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stem from it. First, efforts made by local authorities to reduce traffic under the provisions of last year's Road Traffic Reduction Act could merely transfer that traffic onto the national network. A national target would not only ensure that local authorities were acting within a national context, but also ensure that the nationally managed motorway and priority route network is also being managed under the same discipline.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para22"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, referred to the difficulties which local authorities face in dealing with these matters. Many noble Lords will be aware that I have a long and close experience of those difficulties, having been involved in the construction of both the Surrey transport plans. In relation to local authorities, not only is the correct distribution of funds lacking, which is of major importance, but also the overall direction of policy under which they can work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para23"></a>In that context we welcome the anticipated support from the Government for today's Bill in line with their policy handbook for the 1997 election which informed candidates that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Transport targets [will be set] at both national and local level [and that] our strategic aims are ... to reduce and then reverse traffic growth". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para24"></a>Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, was not a candidate in those elections and may not have read the handbook. However, it is certainly part of the Government's policies not just to halt but actually to reverse traffic growth. I hope that the introduction of subsection (2) into Clause 2 does not cover some backtracking on the Government's part and I hope that we shall be reassured on that point by the Minister when she replies to the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para25"></a>Secondly, targets will be necessary anyway if the Government intend to meet their CO <sub>2</sub>  and air quality targets. Calculations will have to be made as to how much traffic reduction is needed to hit those targets and work will need to continue towards reducing traffic by that amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para26"></a>Finally, the Government have set or promised to set targets for a large number of other government objectives--literacy and numeracy, hospital waiting lists, CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and so forth. Public targets are more effective than private targets and they send clear signals to everybody about the Government's transport policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para27"></a>I should like to add one further comment. The point of having a target to accompany a policy is that it gives us two things: first, a goal--something to which we can work; secondly, a tool--something which measures our progress towards that target. I thoroughly support today's Bill.

Unfortunately, both those interests are unpaid, voluntary ones and nor have I received any briefing from either organisation on this Bill today. These remarks therefore are my own.
<P>


<a name="column_604"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para28"></a>I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, on introducing the Bill to this House. Of course it passed all its stages in another place, but in doing so emerged, if I may say so, as a rather pale shadow of its former self. It has been considerably watered down and I was not sure what we were left with to debate today, and I am therefore all the more grateful to the noble Lord for his explanation this morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para29"></a>One thing on which we can all agree is that there should be a reduction in road traffic. The only problem is that everybody thinks that it is someone else who should reduce their use of the car, so that there is more room on the road, and less congestion, for themselves. That is quite understandable as the car has become, for the vast majority of people, an essential part of modern life, in the same way as the television, the fridge or the washing machine. It is too easy--and I am afraid that it seems to be a characteristic of this Government--constantly to criticise the car and motoring in general, without recognising the enormous benefits to the quality of life that car ownership has brought to many millions of people--many who, in previous generations, would have led much more restricted lives, sometimes never moving more than a few miles from where they were born. The car is here to stay, and in a way one could liken the noble Lord to King Canute in trying to stop the tide of car ownership and in trying to limit people's freedoms to use their car when and where they feel like.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para30"></a>We all await, with a great deal of interest, and perhaps a little trepidation, the arrival of the Government's White Paper on an integrated transport policy. But I hope that it will at least recognise the fact that the car accounts for 90 per cent. of passenger journeys in this country. So far the Government's record is not good. The Treasury is now taking some &#163;30 billion a year from the road user, and yet is spending less and less on road building and maintenance. The Minister acclaimed, with pride, that she increased the maintenance budget by &#163;100 million. That is of course very necessary as so much of the road network is in dire need of repair, and she is to be congratulated. But those congratulations are muted, from these Benches in any case, because it is not &#163;100 million of new money; it is &#163;100 million of existing money taken from the overall roads budget, which is no doubt why the number of new road starts is down to seven this year, all of which were already in train long ago. The number of bypass starts is down to one this year, probably the lowest number in modern history, thereby depriving towns and villages across the land of much needed relief from congestion, noise and pollution, in fact all the things listed so carefully in Clause 2(3) of this very Bill. All the Minister has done is to rob Peter to pay Paul.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para31"></a>But to return to the detail of the Bill, which as I said has a desirable aim, I note that Clause 1 excludes traffic constructed or adapted to carry more than eight passengers; in other words, buses. So the object is to move more people on to buses. That is of course highly desirable, and I am a frequent bus user myself, when it suits. But, as everyone knows, the bus is not suitable for many purposes. It seldom comes to outside one's own front door, nor delivers to one's exact destination. Particularly in rural areas they are few and far between. <P>


<a name="column_605"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 605</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It has been said that this is due to deregulation; in fact, that has become a popular myth. The fact is that buses were deregulated to try and stop the long-term decline in bus usage that had been taking place for at least the previous 30 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para32"></a>The real reason for the decline in bus usage has been the fact that, as people have become better off, they have bought cars to take advantage of all the benefits of car ownership. Changing patterns of life such as the weekly shop--impossible to bring back home on public transport--increased parental choice in schools, out-of-town workplaces and many others referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, have increased dependency on the car.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para33"></a>I shall wish to move an amendment at Committee stage to add freight transport to this exclusion. Public transport is not an option for freight. Business does not move freight around for fun, as the Government seem to think is why people drive around. Long distance freight sometimes has the option of rail but for the vast majority of movements, including in particular local deliveries and home delivery, freight traffic is essential.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para34"></a>Freight traffic is a good barometer of the state of the economy, and I am sure that we all want a thriving economy. Incidentally, if the Government want a reduction in traffic, all they need to do is to engineer a downturn in the economy. But they seem to be well on the way to doing that without any help from me. Increased efficiency has already enabled industry to move much more freight around with 13 per cent. fewer lorries than 10 years ago. It would be quite unfair if freight traffic was to be mixed up in the provisions of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para35"></a>Another area where I think the Bill could be improved would be to strengthen Clause 2. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has already referred to that. As the Bill stands, it seems to be an option as to whether the Government produce any targets at all. If the Government in their absolute discretion think that other measures are appropriate, they can just use other measures and not set targets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para36"></a>The mover of the Bill said in another place on 24th April (at col. 1077 of the Official Report) that he would encourage someone to move an amendment to achieve the purpose of requiring the Government to impose targets. I am happy to help such an aim when we come to the Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para37"></a>To summarise, I give this Bill a guarded welcome. I believe that the Bill can be improved in Committee and I look forward to the next stage.

I should say at the outset, as the Government have already said in another place, that we are happy to support the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para38"></a>We have had a fascinating debate which has been wide ranging. I think that if I replied to all the questions and issues that have been raised, I could comprehensively pre-empt the content of the White Paper, and probably pre-empt the continuation of my own ministerial career. So I shall not succumb to that temptation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para39"></a>However, I must rise a little to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara. I think that he is in very dangerous territory to criticise this Government's attitude to investment in roads. It is somewhat galling to find that his congratulations on our attempts to reinstate some of the disastrous cuts in road maintenance by the previous administration are criticised because we are taking the time to conduct a proper, open consultative review of the roads programme and to try to come up with a programme for investment in our road network that is based on objective criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para40"></a>I have to say to him that the conduct of that review is in clear contradistinction to the reviews and the slashing of the road programme that took place in 1995 and 1996 and about which, I must tell him, colleagues of his in another place, coming to me to talk about their favourite road schemes, have been extremely critical.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para41"></a>But I must return to the matters before us today and concentrate on the Bill. If enacted, the Bill would require the Secretary of State to set and publish in a report national targets for road traffic reduction in England, Wales and Scotland and provide for analogous legislation to be introduced to cover Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para42"></a>If, however, the Secretary of State considered that other targets or other measures were more appropriate for the purpose of reducing the adverse impacts of road traffic, he would not be required to set national road traffic reduction targets. In that case he would be required to publish a report explaining his reasoning and including an assessment of the impact of the other targets or other measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para43"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, thought that we need not be so pessimistic about the negative impacts of traffic because of the technical advances in engine design which are capable--as is the auto oil directive--of reducing adverse impact. The very point of Clause 2(2) is that if those technical advances were deemed more appropriate to reduce the adverse impacts of road traffic, despite increase in traffic levels, that could be addressed in any report prepared under Clause 2(2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para44"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, wanted some reassurance that this was not backtracking on the part of the Government. It is not backtracking; it is recognising that everyone who has spoken in today's debate and those who promote the Bill are looking to reduce traffic levels, not as an aim in itself but because of the adverse effects that come and are acknowledged, together with the beneficial effects on mobility and the economy that have also been referred to. It is about minimising those adverse effects. We must look at all the possible measures that could contribute to that minimisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para45"></a>In favour of setting national road traffic reduction targets it has been argued that they would address directly the need to reduce the impacts of transport upon <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the environment. Transport is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, the main cause of climate change. While emissions of air pollutants from road transport such as lead, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides are falling as cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels penetrate the market, the impact of cleaner technology is in danger of being undermined by predicted traffic growth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para46"></a>The other argument is that national road traffic reduction targets are not needed for the reasons that I outlined before; that the Government should focus primarily on the wider environmental impacts which transport produces--rather than on the road traffic itself--and which are reflected in the environmental aims underlying this Bill. We have a range of targets related to these issues that I should like to consider in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para47"></a>I turn to the White Paper on which a number of noble Lords have commented. It will be published shortly. It will be the first for 20 years. It will establish a framework within which to develop an integrated transport policy for the 21st century. Perhaps I can reassure my noble friend Lord Berkeley that the Government are working on the basis that integration means not only integration between transport modes, so that there are safe, reliable and convenient connections between the different forms of transport, but also, which is more difficult to achieve but absolutely fundamental, integration with environment and planning policies so that the transport system is consistent with the principles of sustainable development. This also means integration with fiscal and economic policies so that a sustainable transport system supports employment, economic growth and a competitive economy, and integration with social and health policies so that our transport policies can contribute to our wider aims of a fairer and more inclusive society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para48"></a>Perhaps it is important to say here--the point that was made by the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas--that this Government, as the promoters of this Bill, are not anti-car. The car will remain an essential element, and road transport will remain an essential element in our society. The Government, I am happy to make clear, accept this and recognise it. But equally there is a wide-ranging recognition that we need to strike a better balance between the various modes of transport and to give people more choice when they are making decisions about how they move around. That choice means providing a safer environment for cycling and walking. It means improving public transport. The improvement and provision of safe and economically acceptable public transport is, I can assure my noble friend Lord Simon, an important part of the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para49"></a>We are looking at ways in which we can tackle the growth of car dependency which has implications for the health of our nation and certainly for the health of our schoolchildren as well as implications for pollution and congestion. We are looking at how we can tackle that through fiscal, regulatory and financial measures and by awareness campaigns and the work of voluntary organisations. I certainly note the comments of my <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend Lord Berkeley on the issue of ensuring that any money raised from congestion charging should be reinvested in public transport. He will not be surprised to know that others have made the same point in the consultation on the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para50"></a>The role of targets has also been raised in response to the consultation exercise. There are a number already in place that have a bearing, directly or indirectly, on transport. Beside the targets for reducing C0 <sub>2</sub>  emissions, to which I shall come in a moment, we have the national air quality strategy; which sets stringent limits on eight major pollutants to be met by 2005; a target to double the amount of cycling by 2002 and to double it again by 2012; and a target to cut the number of road casualties by a third on average levels for 1981-85 by the year 2000, with a commitment to set new road safety targets for the period following 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para51"></a>Those existing targets are likely to be significant drivers of new transport measures, at both national and local level. We are also considering carefully whether there is a need for additional targets to provide a further impetus to the policies that are adopted, including the need to set targets for walking and for the introduction of green transport plans across government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para52"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and other noble Lords referred to the Road Traffic Reduction Act, passed in the dying days of the previous government, which requires local authorities to set targets for traffic reduction on local roads in their area. Inevitably there is a link between the Bill before us today and the duties placed on local authorities under the Act. In January we issued for consultation draft guidance to local authorities on meeting their obligations under that Act. At present we are considering the responses to that consultation. We envisage that local authorities will have to produce reports under the Act by July 1999. These reports should contain the results of their reviews of existing and forecast levels of traffic on local roads in their area, as well as targets for reducing traffic levels on such roads, or their rate of growth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para53"></a>Economic circumstances and regional characteristics mean that traffic conditions will vary from one part of the country to another, as well as between urban and rural areas per se. So it would be unrealistic to expect all authorities to set identical traffic reduction targets. Instead, the Act allows local authorities to decide, after close consultation with local residents and businesses, what targets they should set, or whether there are good reasons for not setting targets for all or any part of their area.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para54"></a>Any measures which local authorities implement to help achieve traffic reduction targets will also have implications for regional and national traffic levels, the point made by the noble Baroness, unless they are to have the effect of merely displacing traffic into neighbouring areas. As a result, we shall be looking closely at the traffic reduction strategies adopted by authorities and their likely effects in determining the role which national traffic targets could play.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para55"></a>Turning to C0 <sub>2</sub>  reductions, we shall be consulting this summer on the measures needed to ensure both that we meet our legally binding Kyoto target and move over <P>


<a name="column_609"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time towards our domestic aim of a 20 per cent. reduction in C0 <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 2010. We aim to publish a wide-ranging and open consultation paper in the near future. It will build on the outcomes of other reviews--integrated transport policy, energy policy, utility review--with the aim of developing, early next year, a balanced climate change programme which covers all sectors of the economy and engages all parts of the community--businesses, local government, community groups and individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para56"></a>Our climate change programme will include measures to improve energy efficiency by business and in the home; reduce transport emissions; and increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewables and combined heat and power. Measures to tackle climate change will give us a more efficient, less car-dependent transport system; better air quality; warmer, more comfortable homes; energy savings for business and consumers; and new jobs and market opportunities from more efficient technologies. I do not think we should look at this negatively. There are great opportunities in the battle against climate change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para57"></a>That puts into context today's debate about the role that traffic reduction and transport can play in reducing pollution. I believe that national road traffic reduction targets are an important issue which we need to consider as part of the continuing transport debate, alongside the range of measures and targets that I have outlined today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para58"></a>Perhaps I may conclude by stressing that the Government believe that the Bill is worthy of our support. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, his honourable friends in another place and his advisers for the hard work and determination they have shown in carrying forward this Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister and to all those Members of your Lordships' House who have taken part in the debate. I was particularly gratified, as indeed was my colleague in another place, Mr. Cynog Dafis, the Green Party of Wales Member for Ceredigion, as I like to call him, who took the Bill through the other place, by the fact that all noble Lords who have spoken gave a welcome, some more qualified than others, to the Bill. It was clearly emphasised in the debate and by the Minister herself that it is not a case of either/or; the Bill is part of a package of measures. In that sense I cannot agree entirely with the view of the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, that this might be premature. But I think that he was putting that as a probing Second Reading question rather than as a condemnation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para59"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, responded clearly to the point of my noble friend Lord Berkeley about a reduction in the context of a projected increase by indicating that any reduction on an exponential increase is a reduction. As we seek to take the Bill forward, we will certainly be able to look in greater detail at the mammoth task that we face in terms of that reduction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para60"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, described himself as being somewhat frustrated. However, I did not think that was reflected in his speech. I thought that he brought a <P>


<a name="column_610"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 610</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nice sense of realism to the debate because sustainable development is precisely about the costs and benefits of all modes of transport and all other modes of economic activity. I am not trying to be greener than thou in the debate, but I shall be returning, sooner rather than later, to Snowdonia by train and bus. However, I may have use of my wife's car during the weekend if I am suitably properly behaved. There are many of us these days, even in rural areas, who try to share one vehicle per household. In our case we are a household of three. The other person in the household, my son, does not drive. He occasionally is driven, but he is a regular bus user. I am just trying to prove that we do sometimes practise what we preach.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para61"></a>The Bill is not anti-car. All of us need to make use of cars, especially in situations of emergency in rural areas. But we are concerned about the overall impact of the car on social and economic life. On the positive side, we recognise the freedom brought about by car ownership and all the attractive aspects of the car culture. But we also recognise the downside of that culture. That point was brought out in the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. We are not trying to emphasise that all aspects of road traffic are negative.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para62"></a>I have to call in aid, without quoting it at length, the report of the Royal Commission. In Chapter I of its report it estimated the environmental and social costs of road transport as between &#163;10.9 billion and &#163;20.5 billion a year for all UK transport in 1994. The true cost was considered to be substantially greater because of the unquantified costs. Its latest report (Cmnd. 3752) discusses other estimates for both air pollution, climate change costs, noise elimination costs, road accidents and the social and environmental costs of congestion. We are all well aware of that. It is those negative sides of the problem that we try to deal with in Clause 2(3) of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para63"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, emphasised the importance of child safety and its relationship to the movement to school by car which has increased so much. It is placed in the overall context of the need for an integrated transport policy. I particularly enjoyed her quoting from the Labour Party handbook. The Liberal Democrats perform an excellent service in this House and in another place by reminding the Labour Party of its election commitments whenever the need arises. The Minister was certainly aware of those commitments. I would not wish to do anything to damage her ministerial career. We followed each other both in the other place and in this House. She has gone further than I have, but I certainly would not want to hold her back in any way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para64"></a>I was very pleased that the commitment of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, on the Opposition Front Bench recognised the desirable aim of the Bill. I believe that he gave it a "guarded welcome". In his reference to King Canute I have to tell him that we have, as always in Welsh matters, a Welsh version of the myth. It was Maelgwn, prince of Gwynedd, who sought to resist the tide in the Conwy Estuary. The beauty of that estuary has been protected from the ravages of road transport by a very expensive but attractive tunnel. It was constructed in the ministerial time of his noble friend <P>


<a name="column_611"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 611</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Roberts of Conwy. We are not making an attempt to reduce the tide of car ownership but to ensure that the tide does not overflow all other modes of transport or other forms of social interaction. That is what the issue of sustainable development is all about, and I believe that there is little between us on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para65"></a>However, I do not believe that I could consider accepting an amendment which would seek to remove freight traffic from the definition of road traffic in Clause 1 of the Bill. We shall return to this in Committee. If that is the intention that was being signalled, I do not believe I shall be able to accept it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para66"></a>As regards the noble Lord's other point of placing further duties on the Government, we can certainly look again at what is available to us now in Clause 2(2). That indicates clearly that there is a duty on the Secretary of State. In my reading of it, this particular version puts the road traffic reduction targets in the context of other targets. When the White Paper emerges no doubt we shall be able to see how all these various targets contribute to each other. That is my final point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-03_para67"></a>I would like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate. Again, I would like to cite my honourable friend in the other place, Cynog Dafis, for his sterling work in taking the Bill through the other place. I look forward to doing the same here successfully. As regards my immediate interests, they are to fulfil Her Majesty's Government's new targets for walking. I hope to put in at least 20 miles this weekend and that means that I shall qualify.

<A NAME = "80605-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Perhaps I may explain the approach which my noble friends and I have taken as regards amendments to this Bill. I was unavoidably absent at Second Reading, but I share the view expressed by many in that debate--by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and my noble friends Lady Turner and Lord McCarthy--that this is an excellent and long overdue venture. It follows the usual procedure now for matters of this kind of a Private Member's Bill <P>


<a name="column_612"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 612</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supported by the Government. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and the members of Public Concern at Work on putting this Bill forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para6"></a>However, no Bill is perfect. We apprehend that it is equally our job, with a Bill that goes through this procedure, to suggest revisions where we believe it is proper so to do. But it is sometimes difficult to know to whom to direct the suggestions, whether to the originators of the Bill or to the Minister. No doubt they will explain their own individual positions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para7"></a>In addition, we have not tabled every possible amendment that we believe should be made. Perhaps I may use this opportunity to mention one or two matters which deserve a second look, but which we did not include in our amendments. For example, in the new Section 43C it is suggested that an employer may--or by inference may not--authorise a grievance procedure. At Second Reading (Hansard, 11/5/98; col. 901.) the Minister said, very sensibly, that employers,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may build upon existing grievance procedures or it may be more appropriate to designate a senior manager, the company's lawyer or an auditor as the person with whom concerns should be raised". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para8"></a>Perhaps the Bill does not take full account of the fact that in 1995 the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that in these days,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is an implied term in a contract of employment that the employers will reasonably and promptly afford a reasonable opportunity to their employees to obtain redress of any grievance they may have". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para9"></a>That was in the case of Goold v. McConnell in 1995. I am not suggesting--and neither are my noble friends--that a grievance procedure, as it is usually understood, is precisely the sensible procedure to have for disclosures of this sort, but with a small amount of adjustment what is now a legal duty could be made to serve, as the Minister suggested, in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para10"></a>We have not put down amendments on the question of the burden of proof. I ask the Minister if he will, with his skilled advisers, look through the Bill to see exactly on whom lies the burden of proving something true or false.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para11"></a>I shall speak to Amendment No. 1, which arises in this way. The whole philosophy of the Bill would appear to be based on a worker taking reasonable action on the basis of reasonable belief. That does not in any way summarise fully the terms of what will be new Sections 43C, 43G and 43H on which we shall no doubt spend more time later. The thread that I found was that if a worker is behaving reasonably, he might on the whole be able to slip through these hoops.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para12"></a>However, that is certainly not so with regard to one subsection. I refer to the case of a worker who in good faith and reasonably, so he believes, wants to disclose to a proper person some misfeasance of Maxwellian proportions. He may find that unintentionally he has transgressed some strict rule of the criminal law. We no longer teach our students that mens rea or a guilty mind is necessarily part of a criminal offence. If that employee is working with someone who is hacking information from another programme--a few years ago we made that a crime--he may not know that that information is coming from a young hacker, who will <P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>probably be aged about 12 because in order to get a really good hacker one has to go down the age range, that employee will be committing a crime. However, the worker sitting next to him, who then wants to disclose the matter, may be an accessory. In certain circumstances, I would be prepared to argue that he could be a principal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para13"></a>The example that is usually given is of someone finding that he is acting contrary to by-laws. That arises especially where a worker is giving the information, on paper, as it were, in a place where he is not supposed to do that. It is easy to find by-laws that may be transgressed. It has been suggested to me that there may be situations in which such an employee could innocently trespass with others into private property and find that he was part of an aggravated trespass under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para14"></a>In such circumstances, the amendment suggests that that employee may be made to lose his protections under the Bill--that is what is at stake in subsection (3)--if he commits any criminal act with or without mental intent. The amendment retains the loss of protection where the worker has acted either knowingly or recklessly in that way. The word "recklessly" covers a wide ground. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, once put it, it is the man who turns a blind eye. Other members of the judiciary have described it as including "Nelsonian knowledge". I accept that. Indeed, I am asking for a small area of ground in which the worker maintains the possibility of protection under the rest of these provisions when he knows none of the elements, and has failed to inquire into any of the elements, which constitute a criminal offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para15"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said something with which I entirely agree. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This ... will become a statute which will not be easy for the ordinary worker in the workplace to interpret without some help".--[Official Report, 11/5/98; col.904.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para16"></a>I entirely accept that. Indeed, I have adopted that line. Surely the ordinary worker will understand whether he is being penalised--because now we are saying that he will lose his protections--just because in the course of his action he wandered into some area of criminal liability about which he knew nothing and of which no one had advised him. If the employee has reason to take advice, that still falls within the provisions of the Bill. Surely it is not a circumstance which should remove the protection of disclosure by a worker wholly taken by surprise at his criminality. I fear the day when the worker is deprived of his protection when others are not merely because of what may be the accident of criminality in the actions in which he has joined. I take it that the provisions would cover the position of a worker who is part of a group which could be said to be a conspiracy, aiming at the same venture; the acts of one being attributed as the acts of all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para17"></a>This is a small amendment, based on what many people believe to be the philosophy of the Bill, which is that if workers act reasonably, are sensible, and take advice when they obviously should, they will be protected in a broad sense. We think that subsection (3) offends that. We do not believe that there is any problem with the Official Secrets Act. Anyone who is subject to <P>


<a name="column_614"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 614</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that Act will know that they have to get things cleared. We thought that we should table this small amendment for your Lordships' consideration. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Nolan: </B>   I totally applaud the motive underlying the amendment, and perhaps I may say a word or two about it. The clause as it stands requires proof of the commission of a criminal offence by the employee who is to be deprived of the protection of the Bill. If he has been prosecuted in a criminal court, questions of proof will proceed on ordinary lines. If the question arises in, say, an industrial tribunal, I believe the law to be that the offence would still have to be proved according to the standard appropriate for crime. That was certainly the view expressed by my noble and learned friend Lord Lane when he was Lord Chief Justice, and on a number of occasions by my noble and learned friend Lord Denning. It would be a rare and rash judge who would take a different view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para18"></a>I cannot put my finger on every one of these offences, but I suspect that many, if not all, contain their own specified type of guilty mind, guilty knowledge or perhaps a defence for the innocent, unwitting transgression of a statute. I wonder whether some confusion might arise if, on top of the requirements of the provisions for the commission of a particular offence, the tribunal considering the matter has to add in the adverbs "knowingly or recklessly". Might that not present the tribunal with some difficult questions of law when I hope that that will not be necessary? In other words, I hope that the fact that the offence has been committed will itself be a matter of sufficient gravity as to deprive the employee of the protection of this measure as long as he fulfils the ordinary requirements of the relevant Act for the commission of the offence. Of course, it might be one of strict liability, but they are rare. Usually some guilty mind is required. I question whether the additional words might muddy the waters instead of clarifying the law, which is the intention of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-04_para19"></a>While I am on my feet perhaps I may add that, like my noble and learned friend, I was unable to attend the Second Reading debate. However, I should like now to welcome the Bill. My three years in a previous incarnation as chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life persuaded me of the urgent need for such a measure. That view was shared by all my fellow committee members. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and his colleagues at Public Concern at Work for so skilfully achieving the essential but delicate balance in this measure between the public interest and the interests of employers.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80605-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Perhaps I may disagree with the direction taken by the noble and learned Lord. He seems to be concentrating on what might happen if a case got to court or to a tribunal. The noble and learned Lord may be right about that; I would not know; but the object of the Bill is to get things started. The object of the Bill is that if workers believe that their employers, or those acting for them, have committed a criminal offence, not complied with a legal obligation, have been <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>party to a miscarriage of justice, have put at risk health and safety and so on, they want to know whether they can do anything about it under an Act of Parliament. Can they now do something about it? The Bill states that they can take advice from a lawyer. We say that they should also be able to see a trade union official. But what will they be told? They will be told that, while they may have evidence, they cannot know all the details, what the employer's defence will be or whether he has certain explanations for what has happened.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para0"></a>The worker may say that that is all he knows and ask whether he can have a go. We suggest that at that moment the person who offers advice can say to the worker that he will not be done for ignorance but for recklessness. It will require caution and care, but if there is something of which the worker is unaware he will still be protected. We fear that unless something like that is available at the beginning of the process there will not be a process at all.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I very much welcome the contribution of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, to our consideration of the Bill today, and in particular his support for it. The Bill fulfils one of the key points made in the second report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life which the noble and learned Lord chaired with distinction: the need to encourage greater openness within organisations when dealing with wrongdoing or failures. We feel that this Bill will encourage greater openness in both the public and private sectors. I also acknowledge the important work carried out by the noble and learned Lord's committee identifying the need for effective internal procedures to allow employees to raise their concerns. We believe that the Bill will encourage employers to use existing procedures or to introduce new ones where necessary to facilitate internal disclosures and the prompt resolution of problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para1"></a>Turning to the amendment, Section 43B(3) in Clause 1 excludes protection for workers where they make a disclosure that involves a criminal offence. The Bill could not possibly provide carte blanche  protection for those who made disclosures that breached other statutory prohibitions on disclosures and therefore involved criminal offences. If it did, the Government could not possibly support such a measure; yet the purpose of the amendment is to provide a defence in a case where the individual did not know, and it was reasonable for him not to know, that an offence was being committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para2"></a>We believe that the amendment is both unnecessary and undesirable. In some cases lack of knowledge is already a defence against breaches of statutory prohibitions on disclosure, and one example of that is the Official Secrets Act. In such cases the amendment would assist workers. However, ignorance of the law in other cases is no excuse. The Bill must not undermine the statutory provisions that Parliament has put in place. If individuals ought to be able to disregard the law because they did not know of its existence, that should be provided in the statute itself, not just in the particular circumstances covered by this Bill. The effect of the <P>


<a name="column_616"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment is that employers could be prohibited from disciplining an employee who had committed a criminal offence. That cannot be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para3"></a>I turn to the particular case of the hacker raised by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. Section 43B(3) in Clause 1 excludes from protection disclosures which involve a criminal offence, but that does not mean that there must necessarily be a conviction or a criminal prosecution for the section to apply. My noble friend Lord McCarthy referred to the Bill being reasonable. I believe that if the matter went before a tribunal a high standard of proof would be required before the tribune could decide whether an offence had been committed. That would ensure a fair hearing for the employee. Nor would it be the same as finding the individual guilty of a criminal offence. But clearly it would be wrong to protect workers who had broken the law and the Bill cannot do so. Bearing that in mind, I hope that my noble friend will reconsider his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   This Bill is meant to encourage any worker in any workplace who discovers a malpractice of some kind, whether it is financial, a breach of safety regulations or the commission of a criminal offence by the employer--several examples were given by me and other noble Lords during Second Reading--to disclose those matters in the public interest. It is not concerned with a worker who wishes to disclose some malpractice for his own ends, possibly to try to gain a private advantage. As the title of the Bill clearly indicates, it is concerned with the public interest. In our society and the general scheme of things because the law states that a criminal offence can be committed only when it takes place knowingly or recklessly, or where it is a strict liability offence, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has indicated, it is very difficult to say that the commission of a criminal offence by a discloser can nonetheless be in the public interest. That is the difficulty I face in supporting the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para4"></a>I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, not only for his support for the Bill but for his comment that, as and when a matter of this kind comes before an industrial tribunal, because a worker, having disclosed some malpractice, is victimised or dismissed, if it is faced with the argument on the part of the employer that the employee, by disclosing the malpractice, has committed a criminal offence that must be proved before that tribunal to the criminal standard; that is, beyond reasonable doubt. The case cited by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, was one decided by the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lane, who held that in disciplinary proceedings involving a solicitor, where it was alleged that a professional had committed a serious crime, the tribunal should apply the criminal standard of proof. Having in mind the situations that may arise under this Bill, the consequences for the reputation and employability of an employee who is dismissed because he is thought to have committed an offence of some kind will be no less grave than those for a professional such as a solicitor who is struck off as a result of allegations of a serious crime affecting his professional integrity. Therefore, I respectfully agree with the noble <P>


<a name="column_617"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and learned Lord, Lord Nolan. I suggest that it is safe to assume that an industrial tribunal will follow that precedent and adopt the criminal standard of proof in applying Section 43B(3).
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy said that that may well be the situation if the matter comes to an industrial tribunal, but he is concerned with the encouragement or discouragement at the earlier stage where an employee is considering the possibility of disclosing a malpractice, going perhaps to someone for advice on the subject and being told, "Well, there are certain provisions in the Act which will protect you if you are victimised as a result of disclosing a malpractice but not if you commit a criminal offence". But anyone, including any lawyer, with whom that is discussed will surely make the point made also by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, that the employer will not have any defence to a claim for unfair dismissal following victimisation and so on unless it can be proved to a criminal standard of proof that an offence has been committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para6"></a>I do not think I need to go into the Official Secrets Act because, although that was raised during the Second Reading debate by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has appreciated that there are defences there if a prosecution is brought under that Act, whereby no offence is committed should there be reasonable cause to believe that the matter did not relate to defence or security matters, intelligence and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para7"></a>There is a residue, if one may put it that way, of purpose to this amendment which I respect. It relates solely to strict liability offences. However, apart from the point made particularly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, with regard to the burden of proof before any industrial tribunal, in many of the secrecy offences--of which there are several hundred involving strict liability--there is no matter of having to prove knowledge or recklessness before you can be found guilty. The freedom of information White Paper which was produced a few months ago, Cmnd. 3818, entitled Your Right to Know, points out:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government intends where appropriate that the new Act--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para8"></a>the freedom of information Act, as it will be--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should repeal or amend the many existing statutory bars to disclosure that have been identified". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para9"></a>If it were not for that, I would see a greater risk which the amendment would justify and would be seeking to deal with. However, I am content that many provisions are being reviewed by the Government concerning strict liability offences. One hopes that the Government will bear in mind these matters when they come to the freedom of information Act as it will eventually become, and the earlier secrecy provisions in a whole range of Acts of Parliament will disappear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para10"></a>It seems to me that at the end of the day in a public interest disclosure Bill it is not appropriate to say that it is in the public interest to disclose things that are under the existing law criminal. Let us rest on the belief that many strict liability offences that currently exist perhaps should not exist and can be argued against in due course when we discuss the freedom of information Bill. I would ask the proposers of this amendment not to pursue it because it is not appropriate, in a Bill dealing <P>


<a name="column_618"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 618</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with particular matters of disclosure between employers and employees, to seek to make it appear that it is in the public interest to disclose something even though the disclosure involves something that is currently a criminal offence.

<A NAME="80605-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I thank those who have made comments on our amendment and I shall try to be brief in responding. So far as the Minister is concerned, my noble friend spoke at one point about convictions, but of course this amendment is not about convictions. The problem which the noble and learned Lord and my noble friend Lord Borrie have touched upon is twofold. First, it has behind it a whole raft of sections of clauses which express the public interest in terms of what it is right or not right for the worker to disclose. We have such a complicated set of provisions on the public interest that I take it my noble friend Lord Borrie is reasonably satisfied with them as he has not put down any amendments. Therefore when it comes to the tribunal, it comes, it is true, as a civil matter but, subject to one place--I cannot find any other place in the Bill where this is so--it comes to the tribunal with the question: was this dismissal protected or was this detriment within the terms of what we will come to later on?
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para11"></a>The tribunal, the EAT, the Court of Appeal and, if need be, the House of Lords will decide this according to the usual civil tests of probability. Of course counsel may say--my noble friend Lord McCarthy made the point--or the manager may say to the worker, "Don't you go on with this because I have got a little strict liability crime in my books that I have been told about and so you had better shut up". The employee, being on the one hand a very loyal employee and on the other hand subject to the problems of flexibility these days, says, "Oh dear". If I may say so, building a point for those to come later, that is the point at which he needs his trade union official. But many workers will say, "I had better shut up".
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-05_para12"></a>We must remember that the point of new Sections 43A and 43B, especially subsection (3,) is that they knock the whole procedure down into the dustbin. If you cannot pass that, you do not get to all these wonderful procedures in the remainder of the new sections. We will look in Hansard, but I am not sure that my noble friend Lord Borrie did really represent the amendment. We are not planning to have any Divisions today and this is the only chance we have of discussing this very important Bill. But the worker may not know, has no reason to know and could not with reasonable acts and omissions know that there was some element of criminality here. My noble friend Lord Borrie asked, "Do you mean to say that he did not have any of those things? Are you going to exempt him from a number of secrecy provisions?". I would say, "Yes". It is not unknown for one Bill to adapt itself to another. If the criminal argument is strict--because I believe that the public interest has to be served--he is then allowed, not necessarily to disclose, let us be clear, but he is past the first hoop and he can go on to new Sections 43B, 43C and so on.

<A NAME = "80605-05_para13"></a>What resistance to this amendment does is to cut him out, very likely in a situation where he most needs advice and does not have it, probably on the shop floor. After that, one wonders what will happen. However, I can see that we are not going to get any assistance on this, although I was hoping that the Government would say they are going to look at this. The whole point of a Committee stage is to be able to look at matters such as this before the later stages of a Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 35, at end insert ("or
<BR>
( ) to an independent adviser falling within the terms of sections 9 and 10 of the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: I beg to move Amendment No. 2. It will perhaps be recalled that at Second Reading several noble Lords referred to the need to refer to unions as being appropriate organisations to which individuals could report dangerous or fraudulent practices. I referred to the Private Member's Bill that I, with the help of my two noble friends, Lords Wedderburn and McCarthy--I am glad to see them here today--succeeded in getting adopted several years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para1"></a>It will be recalled that the appalling Piper Alpha disaster might have been prevented had reports been made earlier about dangers inherent in the practices being carried out or omissions that had occurred. In that incident, it became clear that the unions to which many of the employees belonged were not recognised. Indeed, the employers were hostile. Moreover, since employees were employed on short-term contracts, they were unwilling to be identified as possible trouble makers since they otherwise would probably not have had their contracts renewed. Our whistle blowers' Bill gave such individuals who reported on unsafe practices protection without their having to wait two years for it as was normal in the case of other unfair dismissal cases. That Bill was later absorbed in a more general health and safety at work measure now on the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para2"></a>However, it was natural for the employees at that time to report their concerns to the unions. Our amendment makes that explicit in the new Bill. We have taken wording that already exists in legislation and which has, moreover, been used by a Bill recently accepted by the Government (now an Act), the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act. That defines who is a relevant independent adviser. I quote from the schedule to the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998. A relevant independent adviser is such for the purposes of the legislation,

<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para3"></a>It seems to us that this is a comprehensive, good and complete definition. It deals also with the situation if the union is not recognised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para4"></a>It is important to have such a measure in the Bill. As at present drafted, protection exists if the union's solicitor intervenes on behalf of a member. But if the intervention is by an authorised union official who may know a great deal more about the circumstances involved than perhaps an outside lawyer, then the protection is not explicit. I believe that that was not the Government's intention, or that of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in drafting the Bill. I am certain that it was intended that unions should be given status within the context of the Bill. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   I support the amendment because, together with my noble friend Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde I am a member of the council of the Public Concern at Work. I am anxious that the Bill should reach the statute book as soon as possible. I believe that every effort should be made to encourage industry and commerce to create credible machinery in which employees have faith so that perceived malpractices and wrongdoing can be handled internally. The Bill deals with circumstances where such machinery does not exist. That brings me directly to Amendment No. 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para5"></a>In my experience as a trade union official, the normal channel for an employee to seek to reveal a perceived wrongdoing is to his or her trade union official, usually a fairly senior official outside the immediate place of work; in other words, the kind of union official described several times in Schedule 1 to the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act which my noble friend has already cited. If someone has been certified as competent and authorised to give advice, why cannot disclosure to such a person be protected?
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para6"></a>Secondly, I find a lack of clarity between disclosure made to a trade union official in a workplace where the union was recognised, and one where there was no recognition. Where unions are recognised, there is normally a collective agreement covering terms and conditions of employment, grievance handling and disciplinary procedures. My guess is that as yet few of the collective agreements specifically refer to whistle blowing. In those circumstances, will a disclosure made in good faith to a union official--after all, he may be the signatory of such a collective agreement--be a protected disclosure; and, if not, why not?
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para7"></a>The third situation relates to an employee who is a trade union member but works in a workplace which does not recognise trade unions for collective bargaining, so there is no collective bargaining agreement; there is no whistle-blowing procedure. The employee goes to his union official and in good faith discloses his concern about perceived wrongdoing. My noble friend has pointed out that it would appear that if the union's solicitor writes to the employer the disclosure is protected. But if the union official takes the matter up, then the disclosure is not protected. Is that correct? If it is, is it not quite unreal?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para8"></a>Finally, I have a direct question of the Minister. How does the exclusion of trade union involvement in this Bill square with the proposal in the Fairness at Work White Paper which proposes the creation of a legal right for employees to be accompanied by a trade union representative during grievance procedures? I welcome clarification from both my noble friends.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_time0"></A><H5>1.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   When my noble friend Lord Borrie spoke to the first amendment, he reminded us that we want to encourage the use of proper internal procedures. That is why the purpose of Section 43C in Clause 1 of the Bill is to encourage workers to raise their concerns with the employer first, whether directly or through proper internal company procedures. They need only act in good faith in doing so, which is deliberately not an onerous condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para9"></a>The Bill is therefore very much in line with the Government's partnership approach, which seeks to encourage greater co-operation between employers and workers and trade unions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para10"></a>I appreciate my noble friend's wish to see a role for trade unions in internal whistle-blowing procedures. But the amendment is not the best way to go about it. My noble friend Lord Gladwin asks how this is reconciled with the Fairness at Work White Paper. The Government have already set out a package of proposals in the Fairness at Work White Paper. It is in that context that we should regard the role of employers, workers and their representatives, including trade unions, in establishing greater co-operation. The White Paper includes welcome proposals on trade union recognition and proposals making it unlawful to discriminate by omission on grounds of trade union membership or non-membership. Indeed, the paper lays down proposals about workers being able to be accompanied by a trade union official
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para11"></a>The Bill is a specific measure. It is about protecting responsible whistle blowers. As drafted, it delivers necessary protection and will encourage the use of proper agreed procedures and greater openness between employers and workers. On that basis, it has received widespread support. The Bill contains powers to prescribe persons for the purposes of disclosure. When we come to make the order, we shall consider which persons or bodies should be prescribed. We will consider my noble friend's views in that context and also the views of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para12"></a>But our present intention is to prescribe those such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Financial Services Authority with a specific role in regulating and investigating wrongdoing. Our present view is that it would not be appropriate for trade unions to be fitted into the structure, but we are open to further discussion. For those reasons, the Government cannot support the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para13"></a>The Fairness at Work White Paper proposes to create a legal right for employees to be accompanied by a colleague or a trade union representative of their own choice at grievance and disciplinary procedures. We believe that that will help to assure employees that they <P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 622</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will receive a fair hearing. The proposal is a contribution to the way in which we would like to see problems resolved in the workplace, involving all interested parties working together to ensure that companies can maintain their competitiveness and that workers are treated fairly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   The noble Lord invites us to respond and we must do so. He said that the Government are listening and we must respond. He said that the Government are interested in proper procedures. But he also said that this is a specific measure and that is the difficulty. The noble Lord rightly mentioned many times Fairness at Work, but the Government propose to encourage a legal right for all employees to be accompanied by a fellow employee or trade union representative of their choice during grievance and disciplinary procedures. With great respect, we are not talking about grievances or discipline. We are talking about alleged corruption and alleged illegality. It is not a grievance on the part of the worker that illegality and corruption is occurring. The employee wants to make a public protest and to put it right. This is a specific measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para14"></a>I am worried when the Minister goes on to say that these public activities are not the functions of trade unions. In Heaven's name, why not? If one looks at the history of trade unions one sees that we have a Labour Party because it was interested in public concerns, not only in the grievances and disciplinary activities of its members. It had a role and a function.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-06_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will listen to the argument that on any reasonable case the trade unions should be involved.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I wish to put to the Minister some words of his own and to quote from what he said on Second Reading. He rightly brought to our attention the fact that there are two ways of looking at what the worker wants to do; there is the internal procedure, which those who frame the Bill would like to be tried first, and there is an external procedure. He stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Bill also protects workers where it is appropriate for them to disclose information to someone other than their own employer or the designated regulator. That may happen where it is unreasonable to expect internal disclosure because the worker reasonably believed that he or she would be victimised or that information would be covered up if the employer were alerted".--[Official Report, 11/5/98; col. 901.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para0"></a>Those are two proper examples where the employer is alerted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para1"></a> More important for the individual is the case where he fears victimisation. To whom does the worker turn in such a case? Certainly not to the internal list, which the Minister properly gave us, but to the external list. Those in charge of the Bill say that there will be a list of people who are designated under Section 43F, although it sounds as though trade union officials will not be designated under that section. According to the Second Reading debate, they are being confined to giving advice on codes of practice.
<P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para2"></a>We are saying that our noble friend the Minister is right that people will fear victimisation, but we want them to have a chance of talking to someone on a reasonable basis which is not cut off from other lawful procedures. If a worker is threatened with victimisation, or believes that he is, and has begun proceedings in an industrial tribunal, it is now possible to allow a compromise agreement to end the proceedings. That procedure has been up and running for only a few years. It used to be something which one could not or should not do. However, we passed that provision in 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para3"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner referred to the three groups of people to whom the worker can go for advice and to discuss the issues on a compromise agreement. But it is likely that in the middle of the discussion with his trade union representative, not with the lawyer--and we query the position of the representative from the citizens advice bureaux--the trade union representative, usually of a senior level, will say, "There seems to me more in this". The worker will say, "Yes, I could tell you tales that would make your hair stand on end". The trade union representative will say, "For goodness sake, level with me. Come on, I want to know about this". As the Bill stands, they must go through the provisions in Sections 43G and 43C. No legal advice is involved so Section 43D does not apply. Why on earth is it wrong for the worker in that situation to tell the trade union representative who is acting for him what the case is about when it would not be wrong to do so if he were sitting with a legal adviser, perhaps acting in the same industrial tribunal case? My noble friend's amendment is eminently reasonable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The noble Lord is right in saying that if there are good reasons for not disclosing first to the employer because of the fear of victimisation, the individual will not lose protection if he or she goes to someone else. That someone else could be a trade union official. Obviously, a tribunal would look at it one way if a person went to a trade union official and another way if he went to a journalist.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para4"></a>I refer the noble Lord to Section 43F. The Secretary of State is obliged to prepare a list of those external people to whom an individual can go. Certain trade union officials could be included in the list, but that matter is open for discussion and has not yet been settled.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   As regards the substantive issue, there is no difference between the sponsors of the Bill and the sponsors of the amendment. Undoubtedly, individual trade union officials will play a major role in implementing this legislation at a number of different levels. Apart from the role which trade unions will have in advising employers and negotiating with them on suitable whistle-blowing procedures, the Bill recognises that unions will have a valuable part to play in advising individual members who have concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para5"></a>Where a union is recognised--I will not go into what Fairness at Work states about that and the future possibilities--I have no doubt that management will actively want it to play a role as an alternative channel <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to line management in receiving disclosures of malpractices in the workplace. In that way, trade unions or trade union officials will be part of the employers' whistle-blowing procedures and as such the union will be protected under Section 43C.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para6"></a>Where a member makes a disclosure to his union in the course of obtaining legal advice--and here, if you like, I am talking about the union solicitor--then, irrespective of whether the union is recognised at the workplace, if there is such a disclosure and a seeking of legal advice on how to raise the matter, that disclosure to the union solicitor will be protected under Section 43D.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para7"></a>However, I should now like to emphasise a point to which I shall return later. It is something which none of the speakers in favour of the amendment has so far mentioned; namely, that a key aspect of all such disclosures to lawyers mentioned in the Bill, as reflected in Section 43B(4), is that the communication is confidential. That is a point of some significance to the role of the unions to which I shall return shortly.

<A NAME = "80605-07_para8"></a>Where a union does not come within any of those provisions which I have mentioned, then, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said, Section 43G will apply. In cases where the employee is victimised because he went to his union for assistance, that fact alone should meet the provisions in Section 43G(2)(a) and relieve him of the need to raise the matter with management because of fear of victimisation. The key issue in anything to do with Section 43G is whether the disclosure made to the union was reasonable. In those cases, I suggest that it would indeed be reasonable. I give way to my noble friend.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way. He cited Section 43G(2)(a). Am I right in thinking that that deals with a disclosure which is primarily internal; in other words, it deals with the situation where the person concerned,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"makes a disclosure to his employer or in accordance with section 43F"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para9"></a>However, we should put Section 43F aside because we do not know what the Government will do as a result of their new thinking. Surely this relates to disclosure to the employer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   No. Section 43G refers to someone outside the workplace--that is to say a union official--where at the time that the person makes the disclosure, as set out in Section 43G(2)(a), he,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reasonably believes that he will be subjected to a detriment by his employer if he makes a disclosure to his employer". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para10"></a>The points that I have been making suggest to me that, in practice, the Bill--and, admittedly, it is subtle detail--is adequately comprehensive. One anticipates that there will not really be any problems about disclosures to unions or union officials. However, if I am wrong in that respect, then, as my noble friend the Minister indicated, unions will no doubt want to make a case to the Government to be "prescribed" persons under Section 43F. The list in that respect has not yet been devised. Indeed, on Second Reading I believe that <P>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 625</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I used as examples regulators such as the Financial Services Authority, and so on. However--who knows?--a case could be made and that would be for secondary legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para11"></a>I turn now to the wording of my noble friend's amendment--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Before my noble friend refers to that wording, perhaps I may make a point which I do not want to be overlooked. My noble friend mentioned the word "confidential". I do not want that to escape our attention. I was very pleased that he mentioned the word, but he then passed on to something else.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I should tell my noble friend that I intend to return to that word.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I shall make further comment at that stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am sure that I indicated that I would return to the matter in due course. I do not need to repeat the wording of my noble friend Lady Turner in listing the people who are "independent advisers" under the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1996. I need not speak about qualified lawyers because clearly there is no problem in that respect. We also have officers and employees of unions who are certified as competent to give advice and workers in an advice agency. That provision deals with advice and assistance in the compromise of claims. As such, I am not sure that it is directly relevant to the subject matter of this Bill. I doubt that it is appropriate that disclosures to someone in those three groups should be equated with a reporting of a malpractice to the employer. Indeed, whether the person is an advice worker or a trade union official, it is difficult to equate that with the first line of approach, as it were, in the Bill which is to an employer or someone in the employer's organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para12"></a>Where a person is approached for confidential legal advice, protection under Section 43D will apply. As with all disclosures for legal advice, Section 43B(4) ensures that the lawyer cannot do as he pleases with the information. That is a most important point. As it stands, the amendment would not impose on advice agencies and unions the linked obligation under Section 43B(4). Unless the advice agency or union accepts that the information is subject to clear obligations of confidence, it will be free to do as it pleases with the information.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para13"></a>It is possible that certain advice agencies--or, indeed, unions--will accept as a matter of practice strict obligations of confidence. However, the amendment does not deal with that aspect of the matter. I shall now pursue that issue because, if I do not do so, I am sure that my noble friend Lord McCarthy, will urge me to do so. One solution would be to say that the disclosures to unions under the provision should be subject to obligations of confidence. Therefore, that would make it the same as disclosures to lawyers. But to do so would have a significant effect on the role of unions in labour relations. It would mean that the information could be used for no other purpose than the one to which the client had agreed. It could not be used in the course of <P>


<a name="column_626"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 626</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general negotiations with the employer. More significantly, if the information related to some safety risk, but the whistle blower decided that he did not want to raise it or pursue it, it would not be open to the union to take up the matter itself even though the well-being of some of its members might well be affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-07_para14"></a>Without such an obligation of confidence as a quid pro quo to trade union officials being equated with lawyers, one possible effect of the amendment would be to give irresponsible whistle blowers a potential passport to media and more public disclosures if they were to find an individual union member or officer who would brief the media. The publication would be effected by that person on his own behalf. The employer would have no recourse against the employee whose disclosure would be protected. We are sure that this is an unintended effect of the amendment because, as my noble friend Lady Turner said on Second Reading, disclosures to the irresponsible and sensational parts of the media should not be encouraged. I give way to my noble friend.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am much obliged. Does my noble friend recognise the fact that this point is always made about trade union officials? Indeed, it is never made about anyone else. There is a clause in the Bill, though not very well drafted, about lawyers; but surely that does not alter the very simple fact--as the Court of Appeal has pointed out on many occasions--that there is a law of confidence. My noble friend the Minister said on Second Reading that the courts apply a public interest test when considering whether or not there is a duty of confidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para0"></a>If it is confidential information, it will be a breach of confidence to impart it other than in the public interest. That does not depend on any aspect of the Bill but it does apply to all the other people involved, such as those that the Minister suggested would be proper first targets; for example, the auditors and advisers of the company, trade union officials and all sorts of other people. They are all equally governed by the law of the land. If you want to put in something about lawyers you may do so, but you had better look first at their fees.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I understand my noble friend's point. However, surely he will accept that there is a special provision in the Bill stating that lawyers to whom disclosure is made are under an obligation of confidentiality. If you have that in the Bill, but allow disclosures to other people without a similar provision, the legislation might well be interpreted as meaning that a provision of confidentiality applies to one group but not to the other, whatever the general law may state.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I have no desire to claim any special legal privileges for trade unions. If the Government can accept our amendment if a similar obligation is placed upon trade unions as is already placed upon everyone else, we have no objection to that. We do not seek any immunity for trade unions. We want them to be treated exactly the same as others. However, a large part of the imaginings of the noble Lord are imaginings. In which <P>


<a name="column_627"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>negotiations could unions learn secrets that they are better off not knowing? It is suggested that if they do not know these secrets they can "clobber" the employer. However, it is suggested that if their shop stewards tell them these secrets, they cannot "clobber" their employer. That is fantasy. Collective bargaining negotiations are not based on secrets. They try to influence and to persuade people. It is not a matter of passing secret envelopes to and fro. This is a matter for the union to decide. If the union thought that giving the kind of advice we are discussing could compromise it in collective bargaining, perhaps the union would not give that advice. I repeat we are not asking for special privileges. We are saying that trade unions should be put on exactly the same footing as everyone else.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   As regards what my noble friend Lord McCarthy has just said, I do not feel there is any great difference between us on this matter. I refer to the phrase that he and the Minister have used, which is taken from the White Paper; namely, "grievance procedures". The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, made the point that if we are talking about public interest disclosure of malpractice, that is not what he or I would typically think of as a grievance procedure. Surely my noble friend will accept that the phrase "grievance and disciplinary procedures" appears only in a White Paper at the moment. We are not talking about words in a Bill. Therefore there is surely scope for us to pursue that matter to ensure that if the word "grievance" does not cover what we are talking about here, it should be amended to enable unions to assist their members to pursue with employers the disclosure of malpractices. It is clearly the Government's intention in the Fairness at Work White Paper that irrespective of whether a union is recognised in a workplace, an employee should have the right to union representation in these matters. If that is the case, it is implicit in that procedure that there is a disclosure between the employee and the union official; otherwise, how on earth can the union official represent the employee? In those circumstances I ask my noble friends to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Bill and further legislation will cover this issue. I believe that they need not pursue the matter further.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I thank the Members of the Committee who have contributed to this extremely interesting debate. I was sorry to learn that my noble friend the Minister does not feel that the Government can support the amendment. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said that there is not much between us on this question. However, issues have been raised in the debate which give me cause for concern. As regards recognition, I accept that as the Bill stands at present it is possible that where a procedure exists--the emphasis is on introducing good procedures--that may well cover the situation. However, I stress that in those cases where there is no recognition and the employer is hostile, difficulties of this kind can arise. For example, an employer may not have put in place good safety measures. It is that kind of employer who may give rise to problems. An <P>


<a name="column_628"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 628</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employee of such an employer is most likely to feel that he will be subjected to victimisation if he raises the issue. Therefore it is essential that it should be spelt out clearly in the Bill that that is a protected disclosure in regard to trade unions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para1"></a>I take the point made by my noble friend the Minister that under new Section 43F(2) it is intended to produce a list--as I understand it--of persons or descriptions of persons who will be regarded as appropriate in terms of disclosure within the remit of this Bill. However, I still feel that some issues that have been raised in the debate give me cause for concern. The issue of confidentiality has been dealt with explicitly by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. I have spent most of my life as a union official. We were in the habit of receiving confidential information during the course of our activities. We, of course, respected that confidential aspect; otherwise, we would not have been able adequately to represent the interests of members either collectively or individually. I do not accept the notion that because unions, unlike lawyers, do not have an obligation in this regard, we are in some way less able to deal with confidential information than lawyers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, mentioned the possibility that the press could become involved in these matters. I must dispute that because again I come back to the point that unions are used to keeping confidential information confidential, if that is necessary. I take it that in any event new Section 43G(1)(c) is intended to deal with the press as it states that an individual,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not make the disclosure for purposes of personal gain". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para3"></a>Often the press is involved precisely because they offer personal gain to individuals who provide information. I believe the Bill intends that an individual should not seek out the press first but should seek to pursue all the avenues available under procedures or--the option we would consider--by reference to a trade union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para4"></a>I do not intend to press this amendment to a Division. I shall consider what has been said. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will consider the points that have been made by myself and my noble friends because they are important. I hope that we can reconsider this matter at Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This, again, is a small and narrow amendment which relates to new Section 43H which governs the conditions necessary for qualified disclosure where an employee believes that there has been an exceptionally serious failure. I suppose that the most likely situation is mentioned in new Section 43B(1)(b) which refers to a failure,

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to comply with any legal obligation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para7"></a>If an employee feels that an exceptionally serious failure has occurred, presumably involving some legal dereliction, there is a procedure whereby he or she is protected in disclosing that information.
<P>


<a name="column_629"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 629</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para8"></a>There are five conditions that have to be met. The wouldbe complainant, or whistle-blower, must be acting in good faith; must believe that the complaint is substantially true; there must be no personal gain; and he or she must believe that the failure is "of an exceptionally serious nature". It is the fourth condition that we do not like and wish to change. We wish to replace, "exceptionally serious nature", with, "of a very serious nature". The matter still has to be serious, but has to be very serious and exceptional.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para9"></a>It is generally accepted, and has been stated by a Minister, that one of the advantages of this procedure is that, under it, the worker is most likely to be able to avoid telling the employer. So it is a rather useful gateway. It might be said that in the circumstances an employee does not know who to tell on the employer's side or that he or she would rather go to one of the bodies set up by the Government, or even to a trade union. We therefore believe that this item is rather important. It is important that if an employee has "reasonable grounds"--the concept included in the amendment--he or she should be able to show that there has been a "very serious" dereliction or illegality rather than an "exceptional" one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-08_para10"></a>It might be asked what the difference is. "Exceptional", might relate to a matter that cannot be known. There might be some databank indicating the average, the mean, the norm; and it might then be said that the matter was an exception: that only 4 per cent. or 8 per cent. of illegalities were of this kind, and this one was therefore exceptional. It would be very difficult for anybody to be certain that a complaint was exceptional. I find it an exceptional word. It would be easier to operate if the matter was "very serious". A "serious" matter would not be trifling, incidental or unimportant; and a matter that was "very serious" would be the same, only more so. We should not then get into this "roundabout", whereby we are trying to calculate whether a matter falls within the top 5 per cent. of illegality. We therefore believe it more reasonable and sensible to change the wording on the face of the Bill in the way that we suggest. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80605-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I intervene very briefly and shall not delay the Minister. I had not intended to speak so much on the difference between "exceptionally serious" and "very serious", although "exceptionally serious" is better in this context. My concern was with the other words in the amendment; namely,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he believes on reasonable grounds that", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para0"></a>which were not mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy. We are not happy with that wording. We believe that "reasonably" is a subjective concept, and that the whistle-blower should be required to have a better case than merely that, "he reasonably believes".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   New Section 43H provides protection for workers who make disclosures about exceptionally serious failures. The intention is to provide as clear an indication as possible that the order of seriousness--if I may put it that way--is greater than that for other disclosures. The new section is meant to apply only in very rare cases. The purpose of inserting "exceptional" <P>


<a name="column_630"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 630</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is to indicate that the case is indeed a rare case. Nobody wants individuals disclosing confidential information to other bodies unless the circumstances are exceptional.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para1"></a>However, we all recognise that there will be concerns that are rare, but so grave that they need to be disclosed and dealt with as soon as possible. We believe that the current wording conveys that very clearly. In our view, the proposed amendment is less unambiguous, and leaves room for doubt as to how this section should be interpreted in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para2"></a>We believe that the best way to convey the order of seriousness under new Section 43H is by referring to failures that are objectively judged to be exceptionally serious. There may be disclosures which are very serious, but hardly exceptional, and such disclosures would be protected under other provisions in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para3"></a>I realise that my noble friend Lord McCarthy has some concerns about whether an individual will be able to judge if a matter is exceptionally serious. He mentioned that issue at Second Reading. It is a very fair point. He raised it in the context of guidance on the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para4"></a>Public Concern at Work will be liaising with the CBI and the TUC in developing guidelines. These will provide a user-friendly explanation of the Bill, and the best practical way for workers to proceed if they are worried about wrongdoing or failures in the workplace. That will be of considerable practical value to employers and workers alike.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para5"></a>In addition, the Department of Trade and Industry will be issuing its own guide to workers' rights under the Bill. This, too, will set out a straightforward explanation of the provisions in the Bill. Like other DTI guidance on employment rights, it will be available free from a range of sources. We will certainly do our best to ensure that the Bill is well understood. I hope that my noble friends will find this a helpful and acceptable alternative to their amendment, and that the guidelines will indeed serve to show what is exceptional and what is rare.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I am glad to hear the noble Lord's remarks. We are starting to move on this matter. He agrees with me, as Hansard will show, that there are some circumstances that are "very serious" but hardly "exceptional". In other words, he says that we are trying to make it just a little easier to use this provision in the Bill. Yes, of course, that is what we are attempting. Indeed, we say that it is almost impossible to know in advance what is exceptional; whereas, rather more broadly, matters can be found that are very serious when they cannot be said to be exceptional. So we are making some small progress.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para6"></a>One point worried me. As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the purpose of new Section 43H is to speed matters up. He seemed to be saying that if they were very serious or exceptionally serious, the matter would come to a tribunal more quickly. I do not know whether that is the Government's aim. The aim is not clear; that is part of the problem. I thought that the aim of this new section was to provide one of the circumstances in which an employee might be more likely not to inform an employer and still be protected; <P>


<a name="column_631"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 631</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>namely, because a matter was "exceptionally serious". If it is not about the gravamen of a dereliction of law and is about moving upstream in the queue, then I shall have to think again. Perhaps the Minister will also think again. I may have misunderstood his remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para7"></a>Turning to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the Bill is peppered with the idea, "on reasonable grounds", as is almost every Bill. I do not know whether it is now the policy of the Opposition not to like the word "reasonable" and that they want us to remove it from all future measures. My noble friends wrote this amendment and inserted the word "reasonable". At first, I thought, "That old thing again". It is not exceptional to have such a provision in the Bill. The crux of the matter is whether we insert "very" and remove "exceptional". However, at this stage I am prepared to withdraw the amendment and beg leave to do so.

Page 6, line 25, at end insert (", or threatened with,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 4, I shall, with permission, speak also to Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 8, which all deal with the problem of inadequate remedy, where we wish the right to be made stronger than it is.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para12"></a>In Clause 2, it is the right of a worker not to be subjected to any detriment by an employer. Here, having learned from the Wilson and Palmer cases, the legislator has put in,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer done on the ground that the worker has made a protected disclosure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para13"></a>When we look at the other way in which a victim may be victimised or prejudiced, Clause 5, the new Section 103A to the main Act, states that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee who is dismissed shall be regarded ... as unfairly dismissed if the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for the dismissal is that the employee made a protected disclosure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para14"></a>I hope that the amendment will not be regarded as particularly contentious. It seems to me extraordinary that the worker retains his protection where he has made disclosures but the employer can come in before the act is complete and before there is the protection under the various clauses we have looked at, and, for example, make a threat or do something else to the prejudice of the employee. I believe I am right in saying that it is the view of the campaign which produced the Bill that, if an employer threatens to commit an act which is, in a broad sense, prejudicial to an employee, if it is only a threat it is taken out of the protection of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para15"></a>I have always had some sympathy with that view, but, unhappily, last year the Court of Appeal, in the case of Mennell v. Newell and Wright, referred to in The Times  of 18th July, rejected that argument. It is not the first <P>


<a name="column_632"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 632</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time, as my noble friend Lord Gladwin will know, that the Court of Appeal has done a worse job than the Employment Appeal Tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para16"></a>Briefly, the situation was that a worker, who was a lorry driver, had put to him, as had been put to his colleagues, a new set of contracts. The new contracts which the employer wished to press upon them provided for a deduction from wages in order to pay for their training, which had previously been paid for by the firm. The lorry driver complained and was dismissed. He said that he had been dismissed for asserting a statutory right, which is now provided in Section 104 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which prevents the dismissal being proper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para17"></a>The Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed with that reasoning--at somewhat more length, of course. But the Court of Appeal said no; that, although a complaint could be presented under the 1986 Act even where an employee had not been employed for two years--as so often, that was at the centre of the matter--an industrial tribunal had no jurisdiction to deal with a threatened deduction of wages under, originally, the Wages Act but could hear complaints only where an employer had actually made a deduction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-09_para18"></a>What I gain from that case, unhappy though it is, is that the courts are drawing a clear distinction between things that an employer does and things that an employer threatens to do. As the Bill stands, it does not cover things which an employer threatens to do to the disadvantage of an employee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   Does that not depend on the interpretation of the word "detriment" in the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   If we were trying to upset the Court of Appeal decision in Mennell v. Newell and Wright, I would join my noble friend in making that plea. There are several ways in which one can argue that it is wrong. What I am saying is that the law today, when the legislature is to make its decision, is, according to the Court of Appeal, that threats are out and acts are in. That is true of the Bill. I think my noble friend Lord Borrie and I are very close on this matter. I agree that I should want to argue if an employer came along and said: "I know all about you, Borrie. We know you are going to make complaints about what is going on in the firm. We know you haven't started to do so yet, and you certainly have not got yourself protected, but you had better go and join the awkward squad. You will not get so much overtime".<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80605-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   But is it not a detriment to me if I have that hanging over me?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   With respect, I think it is, but the Court of Appeal said it was not. One has to find some distinguishing factor in Mennell v. Newell and Wright.  My noble friend does not agree. I am trying to do my best with a decision which I think is a bad decision. I am asking the legislature to help us by making the position <P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absolutely clear. Why people should want to rely upon the opaque nature of the law when they can put it right in a place such as this House, I cannot think.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para0"></a>If we do not like that position, there is Clause 5, which makes it absolutely clear that the protection against unfair dismissal applies only where an employee has made a protected disclosure. There is no question of that section being a problem. It must be right, if the employer or manager comes along and threatens the worker.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para1"></a>Let us think for a moment of the situation we are considering. The worker believes that management is doing something wrong. He is faced with the question, "Shall I disclose this? If I do, I may have to go home and say that I have been given my cards and the family does not have a wage the following week". He has to make that decision, helped, we hope, by his trade union representative. Surely he will look at the Bill and say, "It must be that I am protected from dismissal for making this proper disclosure, even though I have not gone about it fully according to the provisions of the other clauses".
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para2"></a>This clause should provide for the employee who is dismissed to be regarded as having been unfairly dismissed, if the reason for the dismissal is that the employee made, attempted to make or perhaps intended to make--I have not put that in my amendment--a complaint. I should like the Government to think about that and prevent whistle blowers--if they be called such--from being dismissed by managers who take action before the employee takes all the necessary steps before he is protected. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I thought he was speaking to three different amendments, one of which is Amendment No. 5, which seeks to insert the word "intend". I have not understood that amendment so far. It seems to me that if somebody intends something and it is merely in his mind, that cannot give rise to a situation which could result in either victimisation or a claim for unfair dismissal.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble friend is right to question the situation. It is true that we added those words but we added them for this reason. Where a worker, in discussion no doubt with others because people talk to each other, said, "I think what they are doing up there is wrong and intend to make it an open matter and disclose"; somebody may say, "You have heard of this Act and had better watch out". However, the worker says that he intends to complain. The manager hears about it and says, "I hear that you are intending to use these procedures to allege that we do terrible things, which we do not".
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para3"></a>The matter rests on the evidence. If he is subject to a detriment, it is on the ground that he intended to follow the procedures in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will see that that is a situation in which he should be protected.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I feel that the addition of these words will weaken the position of the worker. Perhaps I can put it this way. A worker has the right not to be <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to or threatened with any detriment by any act or a deliberate failure to act by his employer. With all due respect to what has been said, I feel that the words of the Bill are better without the addition of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para4"></a>These amendments are grouped with Amendment No. 8. Perhaps I may ask the Committee to take a minute to look at Clause 5. So far in the passage of this Bill we have been dealing with amendments to the 1996 Act. We have been talking about "workers". Perhaps Members of the Committee will be good enough to look at the first line of the proposed new Section 103A. It begins:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee who is dismissed shall be regarded". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para5"></a>I feel that for the sake of consistency it should read "a worker". Equally, page 7, line 21, which deals with the addition of subsection (6A) to the 1996 Act, reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the principal reason) for which the employee was selected for dismissal". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para6"></a>Again, we have so far talked of the "worker" up to this point and perhaps we should substitute "worker" for "employee" in both cases. It is a technical point, but one worth making.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_time0"></A><H5>2.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   Perhaps I may quickly respond to the last point made by the noble Earl, Lord Balfour. I think that the word "employee" is in the Bill because the protection applies to anybody working in the company, be he a worker working on the shop floor or an employee in the boardroom. I think that the intention is that it should apply to everybody who is involved in the company and not just workers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para7"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 and the point made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. I am not a lawyer, and I am not sure that I want to get into an argument over particular cases. Indeed, we may have to write to the noble Lord about this particular case, but it seems to me that the notion of detriment includes being threatened. That is already well understood. I am not sure whether or not the case quoted by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn undermines that. Detriment is a broad concept and the Bill makes it clear that it includes deliberate failures to act as well as actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para8"></a>Our understanding of how this would work can be illustrated by an example. An employee who has made a disclosure to the employer could be threatened with relocation to a remote branch of a company, for instance, where promotion prospects are poorer. That kind of threat is a detriment and even though the worker can be assured that the employer could not lawfully carry out the threat, the fear of the threat may well amount to detrimental action. Any threat which puts a worker at a disadvantage constitutes in itself detrimental action. Certainly, such a threat would be contrary to the openness which we hope to see between employers and employees working together in dealing with wrongdoings or failures under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para9"></a>The wording of the Bill follows the drafting of existing provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which provides protection against detrimental treatment on specified grounds such as carrying out duties of a <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>health and safety official. These provisions have not caused difficulties of interpretation, but to use different wording in this case, as suggested by the amendments, we feel would cast doubt on whether threats were covered in those other cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para10"></a>I turn to the clauses to which Amendments Nos. 5 and 8 are proposed, providing protection for employees who are victimised or unfairly dismissed for making a protected disclosure. I can understand my noble friends' wish to ensure that an employee who failed to get his message across should not lose protection. However, it seems to me most unlikely that such a situation would arise. Normally, a disclosure made to the employer or via internal procedures is likely to get through, rather than be merely attempted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para11"></a>But even if the worker passes information on internally and it does not reach the right person who is responsible for dealing with such matters, it seems to me that a tribunal is likely to find that the employee has disclosed to the employer and is protected, provided that he acted in good faith.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para12"></a>These amendments could allow workers to argue that although they had failed to follow the correct procedures, they had intended to do so and so had attempted to make a protected disclosure. This would of course undermine the clear procedures set out in the Bill. The Bill already contains provision in Section 43J to prevent employers placing "gagging" restraints on employees. The amendments could be misinterpreted to enable workers to use the threat of disclosure as a bargaining counter with their employers, rather than working in partnership with them to resolve the concerns. This would be contrary to the spirit of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para13"></a>I hope that noble Lords will accept this explanation as to why the Government could not accept these amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I do not need to add very much because my noble friend the Minister has set out the reasoning that I would have employed in terms of these linked amendments. In relation to what the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, said, the word "worker" appears throughout. Of course only a worker can be dismissed under the unfair dismissal procedures. But I think that the word "employee" appears because it is inserting something into an existing Act where the word "employee" is used.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para14"></a>I asked my noble friend Lord Wedderburn about the amendment dealing with intention. I thought that intention could be just something in one's mind and therefore nothing could possibly arise out of that in terms of victimisation or a claim. He said that people who have an intention to disclose may well talk about it to others. I can understand that. But as soon as the employee talks to someone who is a senior person--a manager or someone in line management--he is part of the organisation of the employer and a disclosure to him, talking to him, is a disclosure within new Section 43C, and therefore there comes about the protection against victimisation and so on in the legislation. So I cannot see the value of the amendment dealing with intention. As for "attempt", the attempt involves, as I understand <P>


<a name="column_636"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 636</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it, some sort of move towards disclosure which has not been completed. There may be some marginal value in that, but it requires the strong imagination of my noble friend to think that that adds something to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-10_para15"></a>It is clear from the earlier words of my noble friend Lady Turner that we are to have a Report stage. I shall read in Hansard what everyone has said. I ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to all those who have taken part in the debate. I appreciate that I did not deal separately with each amendment. I wish to reply to the discussion with three points. First, I would say to my noble friend Lord Borrie, "By all means choose words different from ours". The only difference between us is the state of the evidence, as it were, of what the employee is doing. Surely he would join us, and persuade the Minister to join us, in so framing the Bill as to prevent a manager from imposing a detriment or even effecting a dismissal before the employee has completed the acts which are necessary for his disclosure, albeit that it is down to everyone, or only to the two of them, that he has the intention and wish, or even made the attempt, to go a little way but has not yet fallen within one of those areas of dense prose in new Sections 43C and 43H. That is the challenge before us. I appreciate that my noble friend will really say, "If you find someone who is doing that kind of thing, either he is protected or he ought to be protected".
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para0"></a>I make my second point to the Minister. Will he stir the stumps of his department to look out for him the judgment in Mennell v. Newell and Wright, as the argument he put forward is, by analogy at least to that judgment, exactly the argument which lost in that case? I never understand why people whose arguments have lost in a case do not take the advantage of being in the legislature to get their own way, as it were, and overrule the courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para1"></a>Thirdly, I agree with my noble friend Lord Borrie about "worker" and "employee". "Employee" is substituted in the relevant legislation where it is inserting something. The noble Earl, Lord Balfour, mentioned that. I hope that on reflection my noble friend can support our amendments. Given the time, I have in mind an occasion, which I have cited in writing elsewhere, on which Mr. Balfour, as he was then, in 1906 complained that Sir Charles Dilke and others, but Sir Charles Dilke especially, the grandmaster of trade union law at that time, were going on too long at four o'clock on a Friday afternoon in August. I do not wish to be the reason for that to happen. Therefore, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80605-11_para8"></a>Clause 4 [Limit on amount of compensation]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 7, leave out lines 10 to 12 and insert--
<BR>
("there shall be no limit on the amount of compensation that may be awarded by the tribunal."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: Like the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, I too, was unable to be here at Second Reading. But I and other noble Lords are aware that this Bill received considerable support from all sides in the other place, as well as in your Lordships' House where, unlike in the other place, it received a formal Second Reading debate. Indeed, Clause 4, with which this present amendment is concerned, was also not debated in Committee there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para10"></a>The subject of the capping of compensation for wrongful discrimination caused concern on all sides of your Lordships' House during the debate on the Second Reading. It was expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, when she cited the difficult case of Maxwell v. BICC. It was expressed again by the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde. Both were supported by my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said that the Government shared some of our concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para11"></a>There is some inconsistency in the approach to this problem. Since the Government have said that they support this Bill, it is as much their responsibility as that of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, to correct that inconsistency. As drafted, the Bill limits compensation to the amount payable under the employment rights Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para12"></a>But this Bill is at least as much about sexual discrimination as it is about other cases of unfair dismissal or improper discrimination. In the Race Relations (Remedies) Act 1994, which I had the privilege of conducting through your Lordships' House, I pointed out the need for consistency between compensation for sexual discrimination and racial discrimination.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para13"></a>In the case of Marshall v. Southampton and South West Health Authority, the European Court of Justice ruled that a limit on the amount of compensation payable in sex discrimination cases is incompatible with Community law. As a result of that decision, the Sex Discrimination Act was amended by secondary legislation and the Race Relations Act was amended by the remedies Bill I have just mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para14"></a>There is a second inconsistency. The Government have just published their White Paper Fairness at Work. On page 16, paragraph 3.6 the Government announced,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government intends to abolish the maximum limit on awards for wrongful dismissal". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para15"></a>So important did the Government regard this announcement that they printed it in bold type. I cannot understand why, if the law is to be changed in any case, the Government cannot anticipate that change by carrying it into effect as regards the subject matter of this present Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para16"></a>This is a probing amendment, and we on this side of the Committee and, I suspect other Members on both sides of the Committee, will be glad to learn of the <P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>views of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on this matter and no less important, those of the Government. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The noble Baroness is quite right that we featured her point in the Fairness at Work White Paper. Perhaps it would be helpful if I explain what is proposed on compensation in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para17"></a>The first point to make is that the Government have proposed, in the Fairness at Work White Paper, to remove the limit on compensation for unfair dismissal cases, which currently stands at &#163;12,000. The existence of this limit means that some individuals may not be properly compensated for their losses. That point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and others at Second Reading. We believe the removal of the maximum limit will help ensure that all workers are properly compensated. I am sure that all noble Lords will welcome that proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para18"></a>The White Paper also invites views on removing limits on special awards under Section 125 of the 1996 Act. It is the Government's suggestion that compensation under the Bill should be based on special awards, which already involve a higher level of compensation. The White Paper acknowledges that limits may deter some people from exercising their legitimate rights, which I believe, is one of the points the noble Baroness is making.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para19"></a>These proposals would make the amendment unnecessary, since both the compensation for detriment under this provision and the compensation for unfair dismissal which it must not exceed will be based on the individual's loss and will not be limited. I believe that that deals with the point raised by the noble Baroness about sexual discrimination.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para20"></a>Perhaps I may make clear at this point a misconception which may arise about the Bill. Although we have talked about the Bill affording protection to workers and encouraging a greater degree of co-operation and openness between employers and workers, the Bill also affords protection to all people working in companies, from shopfloor to director level. I know that that approach has been welcomed by all sides.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   We are glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, has raised this matter. It enables me to remind the Committee that when the Bill was going through another place a consultation was undertaken in which 85 per cent. of those consulted, including all the key bodies such as the CBI, the TUC and the professions, agreed that there should be no ceiling on the limit of compensation. One is delighted that the Fairness at Work White Paper has indicated the Government's proposals, as outlined by my noble friend Lord Haskel, and that they take full account of the responses of interested parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para21"></a>I welcome this proposal for two reasons. First, compensation for one's loss will reassure many relatively well paid workers that they are adequately protected. As such, it will help to ensure that the Bill's <P>


<a name="column_639"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>potential as a check on malpractice will apply in all kinds of workplaces, whether in the industrial belts or the City of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para22"></a>Secondly, if the guarantee of a special award of at least &#163;17,000 is removed, one can welcome the fact that there will be no risk that people will look for a whistle to blow. I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment in the light of what my noble friend said.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Haskel, for their helpful remarks, in the light of which I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para30"></a>This is my third attempt to introduce a Private Member's Bill to outlaw discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation, and to do so by extending the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act. In 1995 I failed because time was not available. In 1996 your Lordships adopted the Bill, but it failed to make progress in the other place. I hope that this will be third time lucky. Because of my background and interest I am most concerned about discrimination in employment, but this time the Bill goes a little further and covers the provision of goods and services and some other matters that I shall deal with later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para31"></a>It is not always understood by the otherwise well-informed that the law as it stands does not afford any protection against discrimination in employment and other areas to homosexual men and lesbians. It is not unlawful to refuse to appoint people, to treat them less favourably, perhaps by demoting them, to pay them less or to dismiss them because they are gay or lesbian. Nor is harassing them or allowing other employees to harass them unlawful. As the law stands at the moment, these things happen to gays and lesbians and there is no remedy for them in law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para32"></a>It may be argued that the situation has changed, that in today's world such events do not occur, that there is now greater tolerance, that there are well known role models and that in any event behaviour cannot be changed, bad though it may be in some cases, by legislating against it. Research shows that discrimination takes place and that it is a common experience. A report <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>published by Stonewall indicates that 48 per cent. of its respondents have been harassed at work; 49 per cent. believe that they have to conceal their sexuality from those with whom they work; and 16 per cent. have faced actual discrimination at work. A survey by Social and Community Planning research confirms these findings. One in three heterosexuals said in a survey that they would be less likely to hire job applicants if they knew them to be gay or lesbian.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para33"></a>We are talking about ordinary people in ordinary jobs. Role models, important though they are--I commend them for the assistance that many have given to the cause of gay and lesbian protection--are often in the kind of professions where there is an acceptance of the right of people to live their private lives as they choose. One has in mind particularly the theatre, the entertainment profession, the arts and--perhaps one can now say--politics. But the research undertaken by Stonewall is about very ordinary people doing ordinary jobs in offices, shops and factories. I have the results of some of that research. I refer to the case of a bartender who had been in that employment for two years. There was never any complaint about his work until a woman colleague asked him out and he refused. When she saw him with his male partner she wrote to the manager to complain about his being gay and therefore, in her view, a possible AIDS risk. He was dismissed. That was five years ago. He has been fighting his case through the courts ever since. The difficulty is that dismissal because of sexual orientation is not unlawful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para34"></a>Next is the case of a man who worked as a cashier for five years. His supervisor found out by accident that he was gay. From then on he was constantly picked on even though before that there had been no complaint against him. He was later dismissed. He found another job only to be dismissed from that when an adverse reference was received from his previous employer. There is also the case of a nursing auxiliary who worked with disabled people for 15 years until he was recently dismissed. There were no complaints about his performance for the first 11 years but his problems began with the appointment of a new manager who made homophobic remarks and made a point of telling others that he was gay. False allegations were made against that employee and he was dismissed. He is now awaiting the results of an internal appeal. There are also very well documented cases of harassment and violence against individuals when their sexual orientation becomes known.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para35"></a>There is little doubt that there are strains of homophobia in our society and some of it is extremely vindictive. It may be argued that little can be done about behaviour but I disagree. For many years women endured inequality not only in pay but in treatment generally. Legislation, and women's willingness to use it, has changed all that dramatically. Although there are still problems they are nothing like those of 20 or 30 years ago. Remedies are available. Legislation has a powerful effect. Generally speaking, we are a law-abiding nation. If one tells a person that what he is doing is against the law he will pause to think. The chances are that he will stop it. Surely, it is unpleasant <P>


<a name="column_641"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 641</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and unacceptable that individuals who carry out their duties at work quite properly should be subjected to bullying and harassment and have no remedy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para36"></a>An increasing number of employers are now including sexual orientation in their equal opportunities policies. Most public sector employers have done so. I have here a list of leading employers who have now done so voluntarily. They include household names like Barclays Bank, Abbey National, Marks & Spencer, Boots, Glaxo Wellcome, Littlewoods, Sainsbury's, Shell and many others. They are good employers, but you do not need legislation to compel good employers to do the right thing. We have to make sure that others follow their good example and the way to do that is to give people similar protection in regard to sexual orientation, as already exists concerning gender and race discrimination.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para37"></a>My Bill also covers the provision of goods and services. Again, it is not unlawful to discriminate against lesbian women and gay men by refusing to supply goods and services to them. Stonewall has had reports of hotels refusing bookings. One hotel owner told a local paper, and I quote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Everyone runs their business their way and I run the hotel the way I see fit. If it is made illegal, I would have to respect the law, but at the moment I can do as I like". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para38"></a>I should like finally to refer briefly to precisely what my Bill covers. Clause 1 inserts a new clause into the Sex Discrimination Act to make it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation in any of the fields to which that Act applies: that is, employment, education, the provision of goods, facilities, services or premises. Clause 2 deals with interpretation and that defines sexual orientation by adopting the definition used in the New Zealand Human Rights Act, as meaning a person's heterosexual, homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para39"></a>Clause 3 ensures that the provisions relating to sexual orientation discrimination do not apply to organised religions. This follows the exemption that already exists in the Sex Discrimination Act. Any decision to changes the Church's policy, or any religion's policy for that matter, would have to come within the Church itself rather than from Parliament. It is not covered by this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para40"></a>Clause 4 provides that local education authorities are under a duty not to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation in carrying out their functions. Clause 5 amends the Sexual Discrimination Act so that the Equal Opportunities Commission can bring proceedings in respect of discriminatory practices resulting in unlawful discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, as it can now in respect of sex discrimination and discrimination against married persons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para41"></a>Clause 6 extends exemption for charities conferring benefits on persons of one sex only to charities conferring benefits on certain sexual orientations only where this restriction on their work is contained in a charitable instrument. Clause 7 covers sexual discrimination in terms and conditions of employment. I should perhaps point out that this would not cover pensions, because the Equal Pay Act does not do so. It <P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is possible that in order to do this an amendment is required to the Pensions Act 1995. I personally would be in favour of that, but that is another argument and it is not covered by this Bill. Finally, the Bill does not apply to Northern Ireland because the Sex Discrimination Act does not apply directly to Northern Ireland. An order in council would be required to extend it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para42"></a>This is a simple Bill, designed to protect vulnerable people. One can only imagine the stress that discrimination causes to many people who simply want to live quietly and unobtrusively and to get on with their lives. It is now illegal to discriminate on grounds of sex, race or, in Northern Ireland, on religion or political belief. It is also, with some qualifications, unlawful to discriminate against people with disabilities, yet discrimination in relation to sexual orientation remains perfectly legal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para43"></a>I recently received a letter when it became known that I was intending to introduce this Bill again. I will quote from the letter:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am writing to urge you to encourage and persuade fellow Labour Members and other Members to press the Minister not to let the Bill you are presenting fall by the wayside again. How long do gay men have to wait before there is a start to undo 100 years of bigotry, persecution and injustice? ... " </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para44"></a>Before I sit down I should perhaps make it clear that this Bill has nothing to do with the argument about the age of consent. That is a different issue which is being currently debated in the other place, and no doubt we shall have the opportunity of dealing with that in due course. Furthermore, as regards the Armed Forces, my advice is that if those were to be included, it would have to be stated in terms in the Bill, and it is not. Again, I believe that it is a matter which has to be debated in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para45"></a>As I said earlier, this is a simple Bill designed to remove continuing injustices in the field of employment and in other fields. I commend it to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80605-11_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, for the careful way in which she explained the purposes of her Bill. Ever since I began attending your Lordships' House five years ago, the noble Baroness has been pre-eminent, both on the Opposition Front Bench and now when she raises important issues from the Back Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para47"></a>If any noble Lord is tempted to divide the House, I shall be inclined to vote Content, or at least to abstain, not in support of the principles of the Bill but rather following the conventions of the House. It is well known that an intention to divide the House should be foreshadowed by a suitable amendment to a Motion on the Order Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para48"></a>I have an interest to declare since I command a REME recovery company in the Territorial Army. It is possible that the Bill may adversely affect the TA and the Regular Army. I have not yet checked the 1975 Act. <P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It may be that the services enjoy some exemptions. The noble Baroness covered that point. However, it may be necessary to consider suitable amendments to ensure that the status quo does not change as regards the services. It may affect recruiting. Parliament and this House would then be able to address this thorny issue at the next quinquennial review of the Service Discipline Acts in a few years' time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para49"></a>In a masochistic way, I slightly regretted that no noble Lord tabled a suitable amendment for debate during the time of the last review. I recall briefly touching swords with the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I know that any such debate would have been a real challenge to me. But I fully accept that the services need to reflect the society they seek to protect. However, at the same time I have to remind your Lordships that servicemen and women may be called upon to perform duties and to take action that a civilian would never be expected to do. I do not think that now is the right time to explore that argument further. Other noble Lords have more important contributions to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para50"></a>We in this country have made good progress with the promotion of equal opportunities both by using legislation and by changing public attitudes. But perhaps an equally serious form of discrimination is ageism, where employers make it clear that an older applicant would be unlikely to succeed or would be excluded from any consideration for employment. Obviously the noble Baroness's Bill is not a suitable vehicle for that issue. Nonetheless I suspect that it affects a larger proportion of the population than her Bill seeks to protect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para51"></a>My final point is this. All areas of administration use acronyms to describe legislation. We have the HSAW (the Health and Safety at Work) Act. In the military we have RFA (the Reserve Forces Act) 1997. The noble Baroness will be familiar with TUPE. Perhaps the noble Baroness should look at the initial letters in the Short Title of her Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I originally put my name down to speak to the Bill because I considered it a vehicle for raising an issue referred to at an all-party disability group on Tuesday. It related to secondary discrimination: people from the gay community who happen to have disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para52"></a>I shall return to that point briefly in conclusion. Since further noble Lords will speak in the gap, I shall speak briefly to support the Bill. This is an issue relating to basic human rights. In these circumstances one is tempted to misquote Martin Luther King. He said, "The law cannot stop somebody disliking me, but it can stop them lynching me".
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para53"></a>We are not quite at that level but we are asking that people should be allowed to earn their living without being discriminated against because they find someone sexually attractive. That is what the Bill is about. If we discriminate against people because they have lustful thoughts then perhaps a young man who works in a shop during the summer months when women wear slightly <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more revealing clothes should be banned. Are we going to carry on down that road? I do not believe so. It is absurd.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para54"></a>We are talking about making it a legal right for someone to be employed without discrimination. As the noble Baroness said, those with high levels of skill or who are in demand are generally able to fight off discrimination. However, those undertaking more mundane tasks or who are more vulnerable are open to it. I hope that the Bill will receive an unopposed Second Reading and will be placed on the statute book. There is no reason why it should not be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para55"></a>Perhaps I may use the debate to flag up an issue relating to the same sex oriented community, to use appallingly politically correct language. It was suggested at the meeting I mentioned earlier that that community should look to those within it who are disabled because they are feeling increasingly isolated. No attention is being paid to them because of the amount of political energy required to pass legislation such as we have before us today. A gay or lesbian person in a wheelchair is out of the mainstream. That leads to mental problems and feelings of isolation. They are in the mainstreams of neither monitory groups nor of society as a whole. I hope that people from that community will take that point on board and put it on their shopping list of things to be dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para56"></a>I hope that the Bill reaches the statute book, when it will no longer be necessary to deal with such problems. They fly in the face of natural justice. Surely, there are better things we could be doing with our time than arguing against natural justice.

<A NAME="80605-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, it is clear that on Fridays an unusual loquaciousness seizes the House. Therefore, I shall say simply that it is 33 years this summer since I had the honour of becoming a Member of your Lordships' House. I made my maiden speech on the Sexual Offences Bill. For the first time, it became legal for consenting adults to have homosexual relations. For that reason, I support the noble Baroness today. She and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said everything that needs to be said about the reasons why the Bill is necessary. Employers are presented with three temptations: first, in deciding not to appoint people whose sexual orientation they do not like; secondly of demoting or dismissing them; and thirdly, of paying them less. All those points were admirably dealt with by the noble Baroness in her opening speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para57"></a>She referred also to the more difficult issue of harassment. She gave some very good examples of the way in which that occurs. She said that it is sometimes argued that we cannot change public opinion; people have these hatreds of those who are gay and those who are lesbian; but what are we to do about it? Surely one must simply put up with it. The noble Baroness gave the most admirable example in calling upon the historic record of the women's movement to show that public opinion can change and can become more tolerant.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para58"></a>However, I have one word of warning; namely, that tolerance exists on two levels. First, there is the tolerance which some people who do not like gays or <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lesbians should show on the matter. However, there is the other side of tolerance, which is that those who are gay or of a different sexual orientation ought, in their employment, to take care that they do not ostensibly, willingly and arbitrarily offend those with whom they work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para59"></a>It is very understandable that someone who "camps it up" in his work may well find that his colleagues do not like it because their clients do not like it. Let us take, for example, the case of the transvestite. I know and like certain transvestites and I am not at all surprised when I find myself addressed by them in the morning in male costume, but find them in "full fig" in the evening, wearing makeup and skirts, enjoying themselves. I enjoy their company, too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para60"></a>However, if one were in a business relationship and the person with whom one was having a business relationship with appeared in the morning as a male but, in the afternoon, suddenly appeared as a female, it is possible and understandable to argue that that could perhaps sway one's judgment. I think it wrong that such judgment should be swayed, but all that I am saying is that there is room for tolerance on both sides. When I say that, I have in mind in particular the outrage that occurred on Easter Day when the sermon of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury was interrupted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para61"></a>I should like to make it as clear as I possibly can that the objects of the noble Baroness are admirable and that they should be endorsed by the House.

<A NAME="80605-11_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, I understand that another of my noble friends proposes to speak in the gap, so I shall confine myself to speaking for just a few minutes. Like my noble friend Lord Attlee, I am one of the admirers of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, who moved this Second Reading. Indeed, she is a great model of courtesy, conduct and kindness in the House. However, I am sorry that she has identified this Bill with something which seems, on the face of it, to be part of a campaign by the gay community to legitimise itself in the face of opposition. Moreover, she has done so by way of a Private Member's Bill to amend statute law which has been with us for 25 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para62"></a>I know that I am perhaps not taking a very popular line, but I am not interested in that. I am all for equality of treatment; indeed, so are we all. However, subject to our support for equality of treatment, we also recognise that there can be such things as wrongdoing. When there is wrongdoing and it is proved fairly in a court of law, you put the wrongdoer behind bars. There is nothing discriminatory in that; it is the decision of society as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para63"></a>My complaint about the gay/lesbian campaign is that it runs counter to the heterosexual tradition not only of society in general but of supporters of nearly every religion one can think of. When the Question is put, I shall shout "Not Content", although I accept that I should have tabled a Motion on this matter. However, this week I have been busy with other matters.

<A NAME = "80605-11_para64"></a> A point that is not generally recognised is the strong medical evidence that homosexual acts undertaken by men and boys are dangerous to health and that anal intercourse is physically damaging and is prone to lead to disease. The use of condoms makes no difference as regards safe sex. There is no such thing as safe sex in this regard. The anus is not meant to be used in this way. A body of expert medical evidence supports the view that I am expressing in a rather clumsy way. I am sorry that I cannot support the Bill of the noble Baroness, whom I greatly admire. As I said, I shall shout "Not Content" at the appropriate time.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-11_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, as I am speaking in the gap I shall make one brief point. However, it is an important one. Society has no responsibility more important than that of looking after children. Consequently nothing that we do in Parliament is more important than to seek to protect children. Children are of absolutely fundamental importance and they should always be at the top of our agenda.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para65"></a>As your Lordships know, a good many children in this country are being brought up in children's homes. They are defenceless and vulnerable. As we all know, recently there has been a number of serious and well publicised scandals in England and Wales relating to child abuse in children's homes. I believe we were all greatly shocked by those scandals. It is unfortunately the case that these homes have been, and are being, targeted by some homosexuals who want to infiltrate them in order to abuse the children. That is not only a worrying development in itself, but some of those homosexuals may carry AIDS, in which case they will pass a death sentence on many of the children they abuse.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para66"></a>There are real dangers in all this. I was encouraged to read in yesterday's Hansard a Written Answer of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, to the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, concerning child protection measures. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, stated,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government are setting up an interdepartmental working group of officials to consider additional safeguards to prevent those who are unsuitable from working with children ... The group will also consider whether further measures are necessary to protect 16 and 17 year-olds who may be vulnerable to abuse by those in a position of trust, such as carers, teachers and leaders of organised residential activities".--[Official Report, 4/6/98; cols. WA 51 and WA 52.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para67"></a>It is greatly to be welcomed that the Government are addressing that problem. However, this matter does not involve only known sex offenders, but also those who have not been convicted of an offence but who have a homosexual orientation and who seek to infiltrate children's homes. I believe it would be irresponsible, and indeed unforgivable, for us to prevent local authorities--I believe this Bill would do that--from refusing jobs to those who apply to work in children's homes whom they believe, or suspect, may have designs on the children in those homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para68"></a>For that reason, I shall support the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, in opposing the Bill. I very much hope that the Opposition parties will oppose it as a matter of principle. It does not seem to me that the Bill divides <P>

<A NAME="80605-11_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I must be brief as I am speaking in the gap. I am bound to say in passing that this is not a Bill about paedophilia. It is about discrimination at work. That is what we are addressing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para69"></a>The noble Baroness has twice previously produced a similar measure. The then Opposition supported those, but they were opposed by the Government, who advanced a number of reasons. They said it was not really a problem; it was not a sufficient problem to warrant legislation; that existing legislation covered the matter; and that if we passed such a measure it would merely lead to more and more legislation in relation to more and more minority groups. They said: we are not the French, the Italians or the Swedes, who may have had such legislation for years; we are the English. I hope that the noble Baroness will not trot out any of the tired old arguments that we heard from the previous government on both occasions in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para70"></a>There are only two arguments that the Government can make. One is that this is not a perfect Bill. The other is that all these provisions are embraced in future legislation relating to fairness at work. The argument of the character in "The Lady's Not For Burning", that it's all got to be done at the proper time, and this is not the proper time, does not fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para71"></a>If the Bill is not perfect, then let us amend it, transform it, change it. Let the Government tell us now what they want to do. The Bill could be totally transformed. To say that it is not perfect is not an argument. To say that it all has to be gone into at the proper time is also wrong. We do not know when the proper time is. This is an immediate problem affecting a large number of people, and this Bill is a way of dealing with it. Therefore, I hope the Government will accept the Bill.

Only at the last moment did I find myself free to attend this House. My view is that the trouble with homosexuals is that they are exhibitionists, and they should keep quiet about it. For that reason, if the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, chooses to divide the House, he will not lack a Teller.

However, it is a mistake to regard this Bill as a natural progression from that legislation. Wolfenden <P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gave homosexuals the freedom to be themselves without fear of being sent to prison, while this Bill deprives those who find certain practices repugnant of their freedom to make a choice as to whether to associate with, let their houses to or employ people. The noble Baroness has introduced the Bill with her usual skill and sincerity. However, there are others who believe with equal sincerity that coercive political correctness has gone quite far enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para72"></a>As my noble friend Lord Halsbury indicated, if people behaved with discretion, as they did in a more civilised age, and kept their sexual proclivities to themselves, the problem would scarcely arise. An employer or potential employer might have a vague suspicion that someone was inclined in a certain direction, but that would normally be the end of the story. It is when people shout their sexual orientation from the rooftops that the problem arises. I concede that there are hard cases; the noble Baroness mentioned a couple of moving examples. However, as we all know, hard cases make bad law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para73"></a>The Bill would, for example, force a family with teenage sons to employ a homosexual gardener or handyman. It would force an elderly and fastidious widow to employ a lesbian housekeeper against her will. The Bill goes further than the previous Bill in that it extends to the provision of services. It would force individuals posted abroad for one or two years to let their houses to people whose intimate practices they found--justifiably or unjustifiably--abhorrent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para74"></a>For the first time in history, it will become illegal to advertise for a married couple. Such an advertiser could face a fine of up to &#163;5,000 by virtue of lines 18 to 22 inclusive on page 1 of the Bill in conjunction with Section 33 of the 1975 Act, which is de facto incorporated into the Bill.

<A NAME="80605-11_spnew14"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I welcome part of the intention of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, in this Bill, and I certainly share her concern about discrimination. I welcome the words of the noble Lord, Lord Annan, about the unfortunate events in Canterbury Cathedral on Easter Day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para75"></a>I do not believe that homosexual orientation is necessarily a fixed state. It is well known that many people are attracted to members of the same sex at certain stages in their life but not at other stages. I therefore do not believe that sexual orientation can be legislated for in the same way as gender. As I understand it, it is the equal treatment between men and women, irrespective of their gender, that is the basis of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Since sexual orientation is not an issue of gender, it should not, in my view, be included within the definitions of the Act as here proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para76"></a>I am conscious of the fact that I am speaking in the gap. Perhaps I may turn to three clauses that may raise issues of potential conflict for the Church, church schools and religious charities. Clause 3 amends Section 19 of the Sex Discrimination Act so that it would not <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be illegal to discriminate against ministers of religion in a job situation which is limited to one sex or sexual orientation so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion. However, Section 19 does not extend beyond the minister of the Church, so that employment of other staff--for example, youth workers, who are clearly in an influential position, particularly over young people who are at an age when their sexual orientation may be uncertain--would be outside the exclusion of doctrinal belief. It seems to me that churches and other faith organisations would possibly be forced to employ those who did not conform to their religious beliefs on sexuality. I should like clarification from the noble Baroness on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para77"></a>As we have already heard, Clause 4 amends Section 23 of the Act so that a local authority may not discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation in the way that they carry out their education functions. Clause 4(2) amends Section 25(1) so that it will read,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a body to which this subsection applies shall be under a general duty to secure that facilities for education provided by it, and any ancillary benefits or services, are provided without sex discrimination or sexual orientation discrimination". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para78"></a>That sounds fine, but those two sections could be used to argue that teachers should give equal weight to sex education, promoting homosexual relationships as if they were of equal moral status to heterosexual relationships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para79"></a>As it seems to me, there is part of an agenda underlying this Bill which is about promoting homosexual lifestyle as being equivalent to heterosexual lifestyle. I hope the noble Baroness will forgive me if I misread her underlying intentions, but if those are her intentions, then under God that is a position that I cannot accept. The two sections may be used not only to argue that teachers should give the matter equal weight, but also that it would apply to governors as well. I would value her clarification on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para80"></a>Finally, Section 6 and Section 43(2) of the SDA says that charitable benefits can legally apply only to persons of one sexual orientation as well as to those of one sex as currently provided for in law when specified in a charitable instrument. However, as I understand it, charities would not be excluded from the employment requirements of the Act and would be unable to refuse to employ individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation. That situation would be of great concern to some Christian and other religious charities which do not believe that homosexuality is compatible with Christian or other faith beliefs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para81"></a>I hope that your Lordships will forgive me for taking some time in the gap, but I look forward to clarification from the noble Baroness on those issues.

I look forward to resuming the engagement with it in Committee and shall now briefly respond to some of the points that have been made.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para82"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, said that homosexuals are exhibitionists. First, that is conspicuously not true of a large number of gay people whom I know. Secondly, supposing it were true; I believe that most of us can think of some heterosexual exhibitionists--the names of Gallagher and Gascoigne come to mind among others. If one were to discriminate against exhibitionists, the profession of politics would suffer grievous loss.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para83"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, argued that this was taking political correctitude too far. The basic principle of political correctitude is that we are all human. As soon as we start saying that we are all human "except", it does not matter what one puts under the word "except"; we are treading on a dangerous slope.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para84"></a>The noble Lord referred to the possibility of letting houses to people whose practices one might regard as abhorrent. If I let my house--and I have done so--I do not believe that I have any right thereby to know in what sort of sexual practices the people occupying it may indulge. It is none of my business. Provided they leave my house in good condition, as they found it, that is all--apart from payment of rent--that I can legitimately require of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para85"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, on the subject of children's homes, raised an issue of great seriousness, but one which I do not believe to be germane to this Bill. Paedophilia is a crime. Everybody I know agrees with that proposition and I believe all the supporters of this Bill agree equally. But paedophilia comes equally in both sexual orientations. I believe it to be wrong in whichever sexual orientation it comes. When I attempt to restrict paedophilia and if I am convinced--as I perfectly well might be next time I listen to a serious discussion on the subject--that restrictions are not sufficient, then I shall consider extending them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para86"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, raised also the case of 16 and 17 year-olds in care. This is a serious issue. I understand what he was saying and agree with a great deal of it. But again, such abuse can happen within a heterosexual or a homosexual orientation. The abuse of positions of power in order to obtain sexual favours is in all circumstances wrong. It is something from which "straight" men are by no means immune. I would be reluctant to use that argument as an argument against employing "straight" men. One punishes the abuse of power and the use of force involved in inflicting unwanted sexual attentions persistently and repeatedly regardless of the sex involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para87"></a>The right reverent Prelate, having paid tribute to the principle of equal treatment, argued that there might be a danger of conferring equal moral status. We all have views about each other's moral status. Most of us, most of the time, have the wit to keep quiet about them. The world's religions have often had views--very passionate views--about the moral status of others among the world's religions. The Church of England is in a conspicuous and honourable place in having learnt that we must live and let live among different religions. I believe that exactly the same thing is true of sexual morals. There are a great many things that are done that I believe do not enjoy equal moral authority. But if I were prepared to legislate against everything that I think <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>does not enjoy equal moral authority, I should take up a great deal more time of this House than I am willing to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-11_para88"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, said that if you do something wrong you should be put behind bars. With respect, if you do something criminal you should be put behind bars. That is a very different proposition. To the suggestion that anyone who does something wrong should be put behind bars, I reply in the words of Hilaire Belloc:
<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-12_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, perhaps I may say to the noble Earl that I used the term "wrongdoing" in a rather general sense. Of course he is quite right that "criminal" is the word I should have used.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-12_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, some of your Lordships will be aware of my own endeavours over many years to secure the advancement of women in public and political life. It is therefore with personal confidence that I can confirm to your Lordships that my party is opposed to any form of discrimination, whether it be on the grounds of race, religion, sex, age or, indeed, on the grounds of sexual orientation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para0"></a>On 14th July 1995 when I wound up for the then Government on the Second Reading on one of the previous Bills on this subject introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, I said that we did not believe that legislation was the most effective way to overcome entrenched prejudice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para1"></a>I said I believed that such legislation amounts to a form of coercion to conform and would add another piece of legislation to an already overregulated society. I added that we preferred instead to explain
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that we all have a duty and a responsibility to examine our consciences and ensure that in our everyday dealings with one another we act fairly and put to one side the race, sex or sexual orientation of our fellow citizens".--[Official Report, 14/7/95; col. 2021.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para2"></a>In some ways it is embarrassing to be quoting from my own speeches, but I shall do so again, because in the same debate I said that protecting the interests of one particular group through legislation sends a signal to every group, however small and however narrow and partisan their cause, that they, too, could be candidates for specific legal protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para3"></a>My views on that aspect have not changed. I believed then that the burden of proving the need for legislation rests on those who are making the case that we ought to have legislation. I still believe that that case has not been made. I doubt whether the case will ever be made that we will be able to persuade a majority of the public to <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accept that legislation--and I emphasise the word legislation--is the way to deal with this difficult and sensitive matter. However, if the majority of your Lordships disagree with me, there is one caveat that I should like to add.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para4"></a>The previous Acts prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of race and sex have undoubtedly provided a remedy for those who have been unfairly or improperly treated for those reasons. There can be little doubt that because of the sanctions that the Acts imposed the law has also protected untold numbers more by inhibiting any such improper and distasteful conduct. Yet, on the other side of the coin, they have also generated a culture of litigiousness which has resulted in a number of cases which really should never have been brought. It is all too easy for someone who has been refused a job or passed over for promotion or has not received a raise to allege that it was on some grounds of discrimination. In some cases it is simply due to the inability of the so-called victim to recognise either his own lack of qualifications or the superior qualifications of the persons with whom he was competing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para5"></a>There is also the problem that there is no risk, because the tribunal does not award costs against the loser, however frivolous the claim or however flimsy the defence. The costs incurred by employers, both in terms of money and managerial time in fighting unjustifiable claims, are a considerable burden. This means that the complainant might just as well launch speculative proceedings in the hope that the nuisance value will encourage the respondents to settle. Some of the well publicised and ludicrous cases that have been reported in the press that ought to have been thrown out by the tribunals but were not may very well also be a factor. Then there have been the astronomical and wholly disproportionate damages that have been awarded in some cases, damages far in excess of what the victim might have received if he or she had suffered some severe injury in an accident.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para6"></a>Again, I should like to remind your Lordships that it was I who piloted the Race Relations (Remedies) Act 1994 through your Lordships' House, so there can be absolutely no question of my being personally opposed to the award of proper and reasonable damages in cases of wrongful discrimination. So the caveat I wish to enter is that I hope that the good intentions of the Bill will not be spoiled, should the Bill ever reach the statute book, by providing yet another source of ill-conceived claims. I hope that those responsible for administering the Bill, if it should become an Act, will do so with discretion, by rejecting out of hand the more improbable claims and thus discouraging others from launching similar implausible claims. I hope when it comes to awarding damages that the tribunals in all cases of unfair dismissal, on whatever ground, and in cases of improper discrimination, also on whatever grounds, will bear in mind that their function is to compensate the victim for his loss and his humilation, his mental suffering if you will. It is not their function to award punitive damages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para7"></a>If I may indulge myself for the last time in my speech, I should like to quote what I said in 1995: we believe that people should be dealt with on the basis of their <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>individual merits and their qualifications, and solely on those grounds. My noble friend Lord Henley is not here today, but on the second occasion that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, introduced her Bill, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We deplore unjustified discrimination. We will continue to send out the message that it is morally unacceptable".--[Official Report, 6/3/96; col.406.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para8"></a>I was very pleased to hear what the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said in answer to the difficulty mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Moran. I understand his concern--we all share that concern: I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, shares that concern--about children in children's homes. But paedophilia has nothing to do with the Bill. I have read many cases of dreadful things happening to children in children's homes which were definitely done by heterosexual men and not homosexual men. So I really do not think that we should introduce that kind of idea into this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para9"></a>This is the third attempt of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, to introduce this Bill in one form or another. I believe that her persistence certainly deserves full marks and, if I may say so, my congratulations. I hope that she will not mind if I say to her that we shall most certainly not oppose this Bill at Second Reading, but that it is not one that should be included on the statute book because we do not believe it is a matter for legislation.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-12_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I wish to pay tribute to my noble friend's longstanding, energetic and knowledgeable commitment to equal opportunities in general and to her championing of this cause. I agree with her that it is a cause very well worth fighting for. I also wish to acknowledge the important role which has been played, and continues to be played, by Stonewall. In the 1995 debate on the previous Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, one noble Lord referred to Stonewall as the most moderate and most intelligent of lobbying groups which recognises the changes of culture in our society and the pace at which they are taking place. It still deserves that accolade. The position of the Government--which is not to support the Bill--is not taken lightly, given its valiant supporters. The reason that the Government are unable to do so has nothing to do with the arguments made against it by speakers in the gap.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para10"></a>The equal opportunities movement in this country is a vibrant one, I am glad to say. For instance, the Institute of Personnel and Development is leading a campaign among employers and personnel professionals intended to promote a positive approach to equal opportunities in the round, including sexual orientation, and to bring out the skills and experience of all employees. The Government welcome and endorse that campaign. I am delighted that more and more employers, including the Government themselves, and 75 per cent. of all health services have equal opportunities policies which specifically include sexual orientation.
<P>


<a name="column_654"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 654</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para11"></a>During our presidency of the European Union, Ministers have repeatedly said that, in order to create a Europe which is "inclusive", we must promote equality of opportunity in education and training and at work. That means combating discrimination and promoting access to employment and equality of opportunity; and providing security at work, while remaining adaptable enough to respond to economic change. It was for these reasons, and because we deplore unjustified discrimination of all kinds, that a very early action after the election was to negotiate the Amsterdam Treaty, containing the new Article 13 which gives the Community new powers to oppose discrimination on much wider grounds than the existing one of sex.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para12"></a>The Government's position is clear. Our manifesto reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The country's attitudes to race, sex and sexuality have changed fundamentally. The Labour Party's task is to combine change and social stability ... We will seek to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para13"></a>That remains our firm intention. I am very aware that in comparison to discrimination on grounds of sex, race and disability, there is a gap in the protection that we offer some individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para14"></a>Let me remind the House of some government activity. The Government's legislation giving further effect in our domestic law to the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights law will emphasise the positive rights of individuals, with all their varying characteristics, and is a historic initiative.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para15"></a>We have changed the UK's immigration provisions so that same sex partners in established relationships have a right of entry and then of settlement after another year together. We look forward to the new treaty powers in Article 13 being put to good use when all member states have ratified the treaty, bearing in mind that we will have to proceed by unanimity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para16"></a>The Government have stated their intention to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity arises. Section 28 was introduced to ensure that local authorities did not intentionally promote homosexuality, publish material with that intention or promote the teaching in their schools of the acceptability of homosexuality as a "pretended family relationship". The section has been widely perceived as discriminatory and we believe that it serves no useful purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para17"></a>As regards homosexuality in the Armed Forces, the Government have committed themselves in the course of this Parliament to reviewing the position. We will take account of the weight of the evidence, of the UK's laws and of the views of the European Court and of the Armed Forces themselves. The review will start with the position agreed in the last Parliament and will look in detail at the findings of the thorough survey which was undertaken by the MoD in 1995-96. A way forward will then be established.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para18"></a>The Government have agreed that there will be a free vote on whether the age of consent for homosexual sex should be equalised at age 16. This could be debated at the Report stage of the Crime and Disorder Bill if a Beck-Bencher tables such an amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para19"></a>I would also like to remind the House that the new White Paper, Fairness at Work, proposes reducing to one year the length of time which an employee must be in work before gaining protection from unfair dismissal. It his hard to imagine circumstances in which an industrial tribunal would find sexual orientation fair grounds for dismissal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para20"></a>I hope that, having assured your Lordships of the Government's genuine concerns, I may now give the reasons why we are unable to support the Bill. First, your Lordships are aware of the importance that this Government place on the family and on the need to consider how all our policies impact on the family. We recognise the central value of the family and marriage, but also acknowledge that there are other forms of partnership and other ways of bringing up children which are also valid. For generations, marriage has provided for millions of people a strong and stable base for the bringing up of children in a rapidly changing world. This is not to deny, however, that there are strong and mutually supportive families and relationships outside marriage. This Bill goes to the heart of that issue. It invites us to treat same-sex couples as the equivalent of a family unit, which leads logically to treating all mixed-sex unmarried couples as the equivalent of a family unit. What we must do is tread a careful path between taking account of social reality and at the same time ensuring that we do not undermine the family.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para21"></a>Secondly, I come to one of our major concerns. The Bill would outlaw not just direct, but also indirect, discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. This could mean that it would be unlawful for anyone covered by the Sex Discrimination Act--not just an employer--to apply to someone a,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"requirement of condition which is such that the proportion of people of a homosexual or lesbian orientation who can comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of people of heterosexual orientation who can comply with it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para22"></a>In every case, applying such a condition would be in principle unlawful. The burden of proof would be on the defendant to prove that it was objectively justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para23"></a>No one can be sure what "requirements or conditions" this Bill would make unlawful in principle, but perhaps the most obvious one is marriage. It would become unlawful in principle to base any treatment or benefit on the fact that someone is married. This is a massive change from the present. In the employment field, for instance, currently the SDA specifically allows an exemption so an employer may recruit a married couple. This Bill leaves it unclear where that exemption would end up. Looking much more widely than work, I am advised that it might even be that favouring married couples would be held to be direct discrimination and therefore incapable in law of being justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-12_para24"></a>In its judicial capacity, your Lordships' House has ruled that there is direct discrimination if, but for her sex, a woman would have received the same treatment <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a man. It might be said that but for their sexual orientation a gay or lesbian couple would have the right to marry. This raises serious and important issues.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980605/text/80605-13.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-13_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that some married couples do not feel in need of a tariff barrier?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, yes. Thirdly, I should like to expand on pensions. Noble Lords will realise from what I have said that any rule that gives married couples preferential treatment over gay couples can be discriminatory. In spite of the comments of my noble friend Lady Turner, outside the state schemes the Bill would have far-reaching implications for occupational pensions which paid survivors' benefits. If schemes were required to pay survivors' benefits to same sex couples, the provision might need to be extended to all unmarried couples. The impact needs to be considered carefully. There could be very significant cost implications for all contributors and all schemes' funding. In the Civil Service alone the Government estimate that this would cost some &#163;20 million a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para0"></a>One problem is that one cannot prejudge the result of the Government's current wide-ranging review of benefits and pensions. We have received representations that occupational pensions should be required to pay survivors' benefits to all partners irrespective of marriage. We shall consider those representations as part of the review, but at this stage we are unable to give a commitment. Meantime, it is perfectly possible for occupational schemes to extend survivors' benefits on a voluntary basis, and an increasing number choose to do so. Even though the state social security schemes may not be covered by the Bill, it would raise highly important issues, especially in regard to the potential differences between contracted-in and contracted-out pension benefits. The Green Paper on pensions to be published by DSS Ministers later this year will open up debate. We believe that that is the right time to deal with this discussion. Beyond pensions, eligibility for certain benefits such as income support and family credit are based on the definition of the family unit. One would need to look carefully at those very wide benefit issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para1"></a>I have already mentioned the Armed Forces. In spite of the advice given to my noble friend, I am advised that not only serving members of the Armed Forces but civilians would be affected. For example, the MoD does not allow its civilian staff to be accompanied by unmarried partners, whether heterosexual or homosexual, on overseas tours. This is a long-standing convention with certain host nations and invariably reflects host nations' religious or other laws about marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para2"></a>I have already referred to what is often described as the family unit. Currently, non-married couples are excluded from jointly adopting a child as marriage is seen as an indication of permanence and commitment of the couple. It also helps the child's legal status if the relationship breaks down. These are not systems to be dispensed with lightly. We are currently considering the introduction into the UK of the Parental Leave Directive. I am aware that Stonewall has informed the <P>


<a name="column_657"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 657</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government that workers with parenting responsibilities, whether recognised in law or not, should benefit from parental leave rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para3"></a>In housing, at present certain succession rights to tenancies are given to the surviving member of a heterosexual partnership but not of a same sex partnership. The Government have undertaken to consider, in the light of comments made in the course of a Court of Appeal judgment, how far that legislation may be amended, but this must be done carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para4"></a>At this stage therefore I can promise that the Government are committed to giving serious consideration to the issues raised by this Bill. I should like to make clear that our reservations are about scope and timing, not about the good intentions of the Bill. I am glad to say that the Equal Opportunities Commission is currently consulting on proposals for extensive changes to the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act. We are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of the EOC after consultation and we shall consider them carefully and positively. Its present consultation proposes a new right to equal treatment encompassing sexual orientation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para5"></a>I can assure noble Lords that all of the issues that I have outlined will be thoroughly analysed in the context of changes to current sex discrimination and equal pay legislation. I hope that my noble friend will be able to accept that it is reasonable to await the final views of our specialist equal opportunities body.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para6"></a>However, fortunately there is increasing recognition that this kind of discrimination in the workplace should be addressed, and many major employers incorporate sexual orientation in their equal opportunity policies. I want therefore to repeat that the Government are committed to looking seriously at the issues raised in the context of the wider review of equality legislation. I hope that I have made clear that the Government deplore unfair discrimination. I hope that I have also made clear that they have good reasons for reservations about the scope and timing of the Bill. Nevertheless, the convention of the House is that the Bill should be given a Second Reading.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend Lady Turner rises to wind up the debate, perhaps you would allow me to say a few words. I listened with great interest to some of the speeches made on this Bill today, although not to all of them. I was very surprised to see that a number of noble Lords have indicated that they may well divide against the Second Reading of the Bill. While it is of course procedurally possible and technically in order for them to do so, I hope your Lordships will not mind my pointing out that it is perhaps somewhat at odds with the current procedures of this House for there to be no less than six speeches in the "gap", when on the original list there were only eight speakers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para7"></a>Certainly during my short time in the House I have known no such precedent; in this case, until the speeches in the "gap" took place, there was no notice that this Bill would not be given a Second Reading in the usual <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way. I was indeed surprised that no notice of a Division had been given by tabling the appropriate Motion so that it could appear on the Order Paper. I accept of course, as several speakers have said, that they all had different reasons for not being able to put down the Motion, but I hope they will all agree that it is a little unfortunate that a Division may take place on an issue of this sort, given this procedural--I nearly said "wrangle" but perhaps that is not the right word--device, or certain devices, that have been used this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para8"></a>I really would put this appeal to the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale: he has heard the issues, he has made his point and I hope that in all the circumstances he will not divide the House on the Second Reading of this Bill. In the event that a Division is called, my ministerial colleagues will abstain, as my noble friend the Minister has made it clear that the Government do not support the Bill. However, as the Leader of the House, in the circumstances of this case I have to say to your Lordships that in my view it would be wholly in accordance with the present usual practice of your Lordships' House to allow this Bill a Second Reading today. I hope that in all the circumstances the noble Earl will not seek to divide the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-13_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, am I allowed to shout "Not-Content", or not?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, of course the noble Earl is entitled to say that he is not content. The rules are perfectly clear that on the Second Reading of any Bill any Peer is entitled to say that he is not content. However, I am saying that the way in which this has been dealt with this afternoon is, first, peculiar; secondly, not in accordance with the normal current practices of your Lordships' House; thirdly, that it would be unsatisfactory, to put it mildly, if there were to be a Division on this Bill in these circumstances; and, fourthly, I think that perhaps one or other of the "gappers" could have put down a Motion on the Order Paper. In those circumstances I hope that the noble Earl will not divide the House.
<P>

<A NAME="80605-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, from these Benches I would like to give my entire support to what the noble Lord the Leader of the House has said with regard to the procedure to be adopted on this Bill.

I should like also to thank all the noble Lords who have participated in what I think was an extremely interesting debate. In particular, I thank those noble Lords who have been kind enough to support the Bill. There have been a number of them on all sides of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para9"></a>I say this to those noble Lords who opposed the intentions of the Bill. My intention is simply to provide a clear means whereby ordinary people doing ordinary <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>jobs will not be discriminated against, mainly in their employment. The issue has other aspects too, but I was mainly concerned with employment. I say that to the right reverend Prelate who intervened to speak about religions and the Church in particular. Our intention is simply to provide people with a different sexual orientation from the heterosexual one with a means, a remedy, if they feel they are being discriminated against.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-13_para10"></a>Contributions were made by a number of noble Lords on such issues as exhibitionism, and so on. Those have been dealt with very adequately by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. We are concerned here again with people who simply want to lead their lives with as little intervention, bullying and harassment as possible. I wish to provide them with a remedy should they feel that they are being discriminated against.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80605-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for allowing me to intervene. I am worried about one small point. I agree that all of us should be against unfair discrimination. However, the Bill seems to provide a reverse unfairness for ordinary people. Let us be fair to the employer who has to pay the wages and consider an employer who has two applicants for the job one of whom appears an obvious homosexual. It may not be that factor which makes the employer choose the other man. However, would it not then be possible for anyone to say--my noble friend Lady Miller made the point--"I have been discriminated against because of my sexual orientation"? Would the measure not give someone the advantage of using that weapon? That is what worries me.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, the same situation arises in any discrimination case, whether on grounds of sexual orientation or any other discrimination. If anyone feels that he has been discriminated against unfairly, I seek to provide some remedy that he can apply. If there is a hearing, it may be decided that that was not the case. But at least the individual concerned who feels that he has been discriminated against unfairly has some form of remedy and some way in which to proceed. That is what the Bill is about. It can apply, irrespective of sexual orientation, in a discrimination case on other grounds. It is no different. Under the Bill, the individual would have some remedy, whereas at present if the ground is sexual orientation there is no way in which the grievance can be adequately explored.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para0"></a>I turn to what the Minister said. I am glad to learn that the Government are considering the repeal of Section 28 which was of such concern to many people in Stonewall, and many who feel they have been discriminated against. I am glad to learn also that there will be a free vote on the whole issue of the Armed Forces. My understanding is that the Bill clearly does not cover the Armed Forces. As I said earlier, it would mean, I think, that there would need to be amendments to other legislation. If that were intended to be included in this Bill, it would have to be stated in terms, and it is not so stated. So far as I am aware, the Bill does not cover the Armed Forces.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para1"></a>I believe that a number of issues raised by the Minister could be dealt with through amendments to the Bill. The noble Baroness addressed the issue of family and family units. One respects the Government's views, and other views expressed. I am glad to learn also that the Equal Opportunities Commission, of which I was a member for some eight years, is now having seriously considered by the Government the changes for which it has pressed for a long while to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. However, I still believe that that does not cover all the issues that we wish to be addressed in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para2"></a>I understand that the Bill does not cover pensions and that special legislation is required. That is because the original equality legislation did not cover pensions and in the Bill, we seek to apply those provisions. I would be in favour of survivors' benefits being extended to same sex partners, but that is not part of the Bill. I understand that the matter requires detailed consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para3"></a>This is a simple Bill designed to give, in the main, employment protection--other protection is provided--to people who have a sexual orientation as described in the Bill. A number of noble Lords who have spoken believe that there may be other repercussions. That is not what the Bill provides. The issue of children was adequately dealt with by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, when she spoke on behalf of the Opposition Front Bench. It is the view of those who support the Bill. I commend it to the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the House and to the Leader of the House for my oversight and I thank him for his kind words. I am 87 and I forget things. One day he will be 87 and no doubt he will forget things, too. I offer sincere apologies to the House for failing to observe the rules. I naturally accept the advice and respect the leadership which the Leader of the House gives us so nobly.

<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para11"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 2 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The clause contains wide powers to make regulations. The Select Committee on delegated powers and deregulation, in paragraph 9 of its report of 22nd April, described it as a "disturbingly" wide power. It therefore considered that your Lordships,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may wish to seek a ministerial undertaking to reassure the House that this wide power would, in practice, be used narrowly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para12"></a>I hope that the Minister who is representing the Government will be able to give such an undertaking. It is vital that the Government should do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para13"></a>Finally, Clause 2(3) requires the Secretary of State to consult various organisations, only one of which is specified. Can the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, tell us what other organisations he has in mind which should be consulted?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   The noble Lord will find that during the first day in Committee and at times today various ministerial undertakings will be given by the Government in respect of the way in which they will implement and deal with the Bill when it becomes an Act. I hope that the noble Lord will accept my understanding of what will evolve today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para14"></a>With regard to the noble Lord's second point as regards the organisations which will be consulted when it comes to making regulations, it is fair to say that organisations representing firework manufactures, firework sellers, those reflecting the interests of the users of fireworks and, indeed, those representing safety interests--and I have in mind in particular the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents--will be included. However, I am sure that he will appreciate that it would not be sensible to put on the face of the Bill a list of all such organisations. Indeed, that would vary over time as new organisations develop and others fall by the wayside. The broad categories of the organisations that I have mentioned would be the ones that we envisage will be consulted about this legislation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am much obliged. However, as regards the Government being asked specifically for an undertaking, that is an issue which will need to be considered when Clause 2 stand part is discussed because that is how it arises. Indeed, the Select Committee referred to Clause 2. Therefore, we should have that undertaking. I have with me the Hansard report of the first day of Committee but, after reading it, I cannot determine whether such an undertaking was given.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   Owing to the disturbance that took place when the noble Lord first started to speak, I was unable to hear clearly the particular undertaking that he has in mind. We gave a number of undertakings on Second Reading. I believe that the requests for certain undertakings made by the Select Committee have been responded to. However, I am not sure about the specific undertaking to which the noble Lord referred. We can certainly look into the matter and give that undertaking in writing or indeed during the next stage of the Bill.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I can answer the noble Lord's query as to where this matter originally arose. It is mentioned in paragraph 9 of the Select Committee's report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para15"></a>Clause 2 agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para16"></a>Clause 3 [Prohibition of supply etc. to young persons]:
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para17"></a>[Amendment No. 9 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.] 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   As regards Clause 3, I believe that we should look again at subsection (2), which says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Fireworks regulations may include provision prohibiting the purchase or possession of fireworks, or fireworks of a description specified in the regulations, by persons who are below an age so specified". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-14_para18"></a>That provision was put into the Bill by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, but I wonder whether he or the Government have any particular age in mind. Indeed, that is a most important point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before my noble friend responds, perhaps, I may, with the deepest respect, point out to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that during the Committee stage, we proceed by means of amendment or by notice given that a clause should or should not stand part of the Bill. It is very difficult for those who are putting forward legislation to anticipate points which have not been made in the form of an amendment and to know to what they should reply. Of course, the noble Lord is strictly in order in raising a question on any clause in the Bill; indeed, I do not deny that. However, Committee stages survive because matters are notified in advance.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-14_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   With deep respect--and I speak from 19 years' experience in this Chamber--my understanding of the discussion on a clause stand part during the Committee stage of a Bill enables any noble Lord in any part of the Committee to ask the promoter of the Bill, or indeed, the Government, if it is a government Bill, what a particular part of the clause means, what its results might be and whether they will consider any further matter in relation to it. That is in addition to the discussion of any amendments tabled.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord is, of course, entirely right, but it is common and helpful when that is to take place that noble Lords should give a minimum of notice of the matter they intend to raise by placing a Motion on the Order Paper to oppose the Question that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I respond to the noble Lord's point that he made earlier. Eighteen is the current age and there is no expectation that it will be changed.

<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para3"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 4 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I have a short point on Clause 4 of which I have not given notice. I do not consider it necessary for me to have done so. It appears that the supply or use of fireworks will be prohibited by regulations during periods of the year to be specified in regulations. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, what periods of the year he had in mind when he inserted that provision in the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My understanding is that there is some concern among members of the general public about the selling of fireworks for some time prior to 5th November and also for some time afterwards. What we have set out in the Bill is a power for the Minister to circumscribe the period during which fireworks may be sold. That would be decided after consultation and therefore no specific dates can be mentioned as regards the limitations that are envisaged. I am sure the noble Lord understands that there is genuine public concern about this matter. This is a fall-back power if the sale of fireworks over an extended period of time were to continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para4"></a>Clause 4 agreed to.

<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para10"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 6 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I may anticipate the points that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is to raise but it may be helpful if I deal with two points raised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation relating to the concept of public fireworks displays.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para11"></a>First, there was concern that training requirements might discourage traditional firework events put on by clubs such as scout groups, or even backgarden displays. I can confirm on behalf of the Government that there is no intention that events of this sort should be penalised. Where clubs and individuals wished to use the more dangerous types of fireworks it would be the intention to ensure that training was readily accessible to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para12"></a>Secondly, the Select Committee sought clarification of what is meant by a "public fireworks display". Specifically there was concern about whether the definition was too widely drawn and might include events of the kind I have just described. I should like to take this opportunity to confirm that we have looked at this matter closely. Clause 6(5) provides that a public fireworks display is one,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to which the public, or any section of the public, are admitted (whether or not on payment)". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_664"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 664</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para13"></a>The important question to ask about any display is, "is it open to the public, or to a section of the public?". We are firmly of the view that displays at private parties, private club functions, etc., are not public displays, because they are clearly not open to the general public.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, that when a Select Committee of this House has drawn attention to particular provisions in the Bill it must be in order for us to refer to the views of the Select Committee and ask for undertakings, especially when the Select Committee has suggested that undertakings should be asked for.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para14"></a>On that basis, I invite the attention of the Minister to paragraph 11 of the Select Committee's report at the top of page 5, and the indication by the committee that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a Ministerial undertaking might be made [with regard] to ... traditional back garden bonfire night fireworks". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para15"></a>That goes to the heart of the matter. That is where the people of this country will be interested, involved and concerned as to the effect of the Bill. Bearing in mind the view of the Select Committee that on this and other matters mentioned in the paragraph there should be a ministerial undertaking, perhaps the noble Lord would be so good as to add to his remarks. I am sure that the Committee would be appreciative.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The point made by my noble friend Lord McIntosh was that it is the usual courtesy of the House to give notice of these questions. As I was not given notice of this matter, I shall have to write to the noble Lord about it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The noble Lord was not given notice by me but by the Select Committee. Presumably he read the committee's report; he was obliged to do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The clarifications and undertakings required by the Select Committee were dealt with in relation to previous amendments and at Second Reading, when I made a statement on many of these points.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am sorry to disagree with the Minister, but in fact the matter did not arise at Second Reading. We did not discuss any of these points. It is only now, when we are examining the detail of the Bill, that we are doing so. However, we should be grateful to the Minister for saying that he will come forward with those clarifications.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My understanding, having glanced at paragraph 11, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is that my noble friend Lord Haskel did effectively give a ministerial undertaking that satisfied both of the questions raised by the Select Committee. We may need to check Hansard to see that the specific wording of the undertaking given directly meets the requirements of the Select Committee. I am fairly sure that it does. However, a reading of Hansard will allow us to appreciate whether that is the case. If it does not, I am sure that we can arrange for undertakings to be given subsequently.

<BR>
("( ) authorise the making by the Secretary of State of provision about the charging of fees for the grant or variation of licences,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: I suggest that with this amendment we also discuss Amendments Nos. 12B to 12D; they all go together.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para20"></a>First, perhaps I may make a somewhat general comment. I should point out that these and the other amendments outstanding on the Marshalled List were tabled by my noble friend Lord Mancroft. I am sorry to say that my noble friend cannot be present today as he has been taken rather severely ill. My noble friend obtained advice from the Government--that is the euphemistic way of putting it--before he tabled these amendments, and we are grateful to the Government for the help that he was given.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para21"></a>At Second Reading my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Kimball, and others complained that the Bill was merely an enabling Bill which was vague and lacking in safeguards. Its contents were severely criticised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. The amendment I now move and those grouped with it, and other amendments on the Marshalled List, are intended to try to overcome the sweeping delegated powers contained in the Bill, which, as I said at an earlier stage, are quite exceptional. I have never seen anything like it before.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para22"></a>Members of the Committee will see that Amendment No. 12A inserts the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"authorise the making by the Secretary of State of provision about the charging of fees for the grant or variation of licences". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para23"></a>Amendment No. 12C inserts in Clause 10 the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"making by the Secretary of State of provision about the charging of fees for attendance at courses of training in the uses of fireworks, and </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>the making by the Secretary of State, or by any body or bodies established or recognised by the Secretary of State under this section". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-15_para24"></a>This is a somewhat technical group of amendments and I do not believe that the Committee will expect a full explanation of them. They are essentially drafting amendments, but they pave the way for a later amendment on affirmative resolutions. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Annaly: </B>   I support these amendments. Without them there is no requirement in the Bill that the fees referred to by my noble friend Lord Renton will be approved by the Secretary of State or be subject to a limit specified in regulations. It was the firm recommendation of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation that the fees charged for granting a licence to both training providers and those wishing to attend training courses should either be <P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approved by the Secretary of State or be subject to a limit specified in regulations. These amendments fulfil that requirement and should be supported.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-15_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   These amendments are acceptable to the Government. They will allow the Secretary of State to specify that fees be set according to a formula which covers costs and allows for a reasonable element of profit but is not excessive.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980605/text/80605-16.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My name is also down to these amendments. Earlier in the Committee stage the Bill received a mauling--in my view, quite rightly. The Bill was heavily criticised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. Having sat where the Minister sits, I know what it is like to be attacked by the Opposition for coming forward with any Bill, whether it be a Government Bill or a Private Member's Bill, which is full of Henry VIII clauses. I am always surprised that parliamentary draftsmen think that they can get away with that in this Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para0"></a>The Government have indeed taken on the concerns that were raised, but perhaps I may make one point. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation suggested that a ministerial assurance might in certain circumstances be satisfactory. The Committee gave a clear indication that it would not be satisfied by that, and I believe that the Select Committee should take note of that for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para1"></a>The Government looked at this and agreed to accept the amendments tabled. We thank the Minister for that and perhaps apologise for the ambush that was created at the first stage of Committee. However, I hope that he sees why we felt it was so important to get this right. It would be not only a bad Bill, but it would be extremely bad for the future and the future of this Chamber if clauses of that kind were allowed to go through unchecked.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para2"></a>I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is also prepared to accept these amendments and indeed the amendments that we shall be debating shortly. I thank the Government and the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, in advance. My noble friend will be moving them and I shall not necessarily have to say anything more this afternoon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   Perhaps I can respond briefly, though the hour is late. I should clarify to the Committee that the report of the Select Committee on delegated powers raised various points but required no amendment to the Bill. However, it sought a number of ministerial assurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para3"></a>I believe that it is a question of interpretation as to how the Bill is read. As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, pointed out on the last Committee day, a number of noble Lords on the other side of the Chamber felt concerned regarding the powers that the Bill would confer on government Ministers. Unfortunately, they did not seem capable of waiting for ministerial assurances to be given, all of which have been or will be given in the course of the debate.

<A NAME = "80605-16_para4"></a>As I say, it is a question of interpretation as to whether or not the amendments are necessary to meet the concerns expressed. As the promoter of the Bill I shall accept all the amendments tabled this evening, but it is worth pointing out that I felt they were not strictly necessary, though I concede that they meet anxieties expressed by the Committee on the last occasion and no doubt other anxieties that would come forward if the amendments had not been tabled and were not to be accepted.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: This is perhaps the most important of the various amendments on the Marshalled List today on this Bill. Noble Lords will recollect that during the previous debate, on the first day in Committee on 5th May, Clause 1(2) and Clause 14(3) which provides powers to amend by regulation the definitions of fireworks and explosives were criticised as Henry VIII powers, and rightly criticised. This was also a matter on which the Select Committee expressed concern. There was no limit on the face of the Bill on what might be brought within the definition of fireworks or explosives--very wide Henry VIII powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para20"></a>As a safeguard, and in order that Parliament may be required to consider the regulations made under those two clauses, Clause 1(2) and Clause 14(3), I suggest that they should be subject to affirmative resolution, and in each House, although of course in your Lordships' House we have various conventions which rather limit the use that we make of affirmative resolutions, sometimes, some of us think, regrettably. However, this is a good safeguard and I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   We have reflected further on this issue. It was always the Government's intention that the powers in Clauses 1(2) and 14(3) would be used only in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the comments made by several noble Lords in Committee on 5th May, we accept that it would be appropriate to make use of the powers in Clauses 1(2) and 14(3) subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. These amendments are therefore acceptable to the Government.

<FONT SIZE=3>Government. It is a very technical matter and I shall give a brief explanation. The amendment would add a reference to two sub-paragraphs from the schedule to the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. Those two sub-paragraphs need to be repealed because of a prospective repeal that the Government have in mind of Sections 30 and 80 of the Explosives Act 1875. When those sections are repealed, the two sub-paragraphs in question in the 1984 Act will no longer be relevant since they amend those sections in their application to Scotland. The amendment is desirable in order to keep the statute book tidy. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80605-16_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what new help is intended for people with haemophilia who were infected with hepatitis C in the course of NHS treatment or, in the case of those who have died, for their dependants.<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para30"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, there is a deep sense of injustice among people with haemophilia and their families, one of the most vulnerable groups in Britain today. The tragic story of three brothers explains why.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para31"></a>All three inherited haemophilia, a life-long bleeding disorder that requires continuous medical treatment. Two of the brothers were infected with HIV by contaminated blood products used in their NHS treatment and died of AIDS-related illnesses. They received financial help from the Macfarlane Trust, funded by the Government, and were able to make provision for their families. The third brother escaped HIV infection but was infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), also by contaminated blood products used in his NHS treatment, and died of liver failure. For him there was no financial help. He went to his grave unable to make any provision for his family.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para32"></a>Each of the three brothers had become terminally ill and died from the same cause: contaminated NHS blood products. But one was denied the help given by a government-funded trust to the other two. That contrast in treatment not only suggests but shouts of injustice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para33"></a>To date the Macfarlane Trust, set up by the last government in 1989, has been given &#163;80 million to disburse in ex-gratia lump sum awards, regular monthly payments and one-off grants to 1,200 people with haemophilia who were infected with HIV and their dependants. It was an official acceptance of moral responsibility for their loss and hardship. There was then and is now exactly the same moral responsibility for loss and hardship among those infected with HCV. But nine <P>


<a name="column_670"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 670</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years on they are still waiting for parity of treatment with other haemophiliacs who were infected at the same time and by the same route. It has been argued that to compensate them would take money away from patient care in the NHS. That is not just to get the wrong end of the stick, but the wrong stick. For the payments made in the HIV cases, including those for the dependants of people who subsequently died of AIDS, came from contingency monies, which is what the Haemophilia Society, on grounds both of equity and social justice, is seeking now for the hepatitis C victims. The society simply wants the terms of reference of the Macfarlane Trust to be extended to include them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para34"></a>Measured against the pain and suffering endured, help on the scale made available by the Macfarlane Trust is by no means excessive. The HIV and HCV infections among haemophiliacs have been described as the gravest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Blood products have been treated against HIV and HCV since 1986; but this came too late for the UK's haemophilia community of 6,000 people, almost all of whom had been infected by then. Some 4,800 were infected with HCV and 1,200 with HIV. Even more sadly, some were infected through their NHS treatment with both.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para35"></a>Hepatitis C attacks the liver and is potentially life-threatening. Current medical opinion is that up to 80 per cent. of people infected will develop chronic liver disease. Of these up to 20 per cent. will develop severe liver problems such as cirrhosis, many of them liver cancer. Based on death certificate information, mortality from liver disease is now 16.7 times higher for haemophiliac males than for the general population and 5.6 times higher for liver cancer. Over 90 haemophiliacs have already died as a result of being infected with hepatitis C. Many others are gravely ill and have lost jobs, homes and sometimes family in consequence of their infection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para36"></a>To sustain its call for parity, the Haemophilia Society has drawn the attention of the Department of Health to the findings of in-depth research into the problems and needs of people infected with HCV who are not yet seriously ill. The research examined the overall impact of HCV on them and their families. If Ministers have not read its findings, I hope very much that they will do so. It is a most disturbing social document. Families are shown to be trying to cope with sickness, loss of income, loss of jobs and loss of independence, while having to live with what they know may soon prove to be a terminal illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para37"></a>The most daunting worry of those infected is not knowing which of them is likely to develop chronic liver disease and perhaps cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. While many will be spared, they all have to face grave uncertainty about their future and to suffer the stress and anxiety it creates. Regardless of their health now, all who are HCV antibody positive will be unable to gain life insurance except at prohibitive rates, while those with young families or other dependants are denied the peace of mind that goes with knowing that, if they become terminally ill, their dependants will be provided for.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para38"></a>The research also makes plain the cost, even to those whose health is not yet very seriously affected by the infection, of having to reduce their hours of work, give up opportunities for promotion, take less demanding jobs and give up working altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para39"></a>The enervating effects of hepatitis C make many physical and mental activities impossible. As well as losing income, most of those affected also face increased expenditure on medicine and dietary requirements. The overall impact of being infected varies between individuals, but inevitably many families and relationships are pushed to breaking point. For those whose health becomes progressively worse the problems multiply. Having haemophilia is bad enough; having to cope with another life-threatening disease can be a crushing burden.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para40"></a>Their most urgent need--and urgency was never more urgent, for the death toll rises with every passing month--is for financial help to loosen the vice of reduced income and increased costs. Not to recognise this is to increase their vulnerability and, as one HCV-infected haemophiliac after another has made clear to me since this debate was announced, leaves people who are doubly handicapped and doubly disadvantaged in double despair.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para41"></a>This is well recognised abroad, not least in countries much poorer than ours. Among our closest neighbours here in Europe, in Ireland the government give financial help; so too, among others, do the Italian Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para42"></a>It was stated for the Government when the Green Paper on welfare reform was published on 26th March, both in your Lordships' House and in another place, that their
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"commitment to the vulnerable is non-negotiable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para43"></a>That declaration raised hope nowhere more visibly than in the haemophilia community. For no one who speaks to those with HCV infection, more especially those now trying to cope with chronic liver disease, can doubt their vulnerability nor that of their dependants. Of course, they know that new Ministers cannot always act as quickly as they would like--and I am delighted that my noble friend Lady Ramsay is to reply to today's debate, but the declaration of 26th March gave the haemophilia community new hope which I trust will now soon be justified by an end to the cruelly discriminatory treatment of people whose plight the word "vulnerable" might have been invented to describe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para44"></a>Meanwhile I shall be grateful to my noble friend if, while conveying to Ministers my appreciation of their decision to fund until next April the provision of recombinant Factor VIII, free from the risk of blood-borne viruses, for haemophilia patients under 16 and those newly diagnosed, she will also make plain the deep concern felt on both sides of both Houses of Parliament about the cut of &#163;88,000 in the department's funding of the Haemophilia Society for the current year. Much of that funding was awarded to the society under the previous administration to cover the costs of providing special advice and support services for haemophiliacs with HCV infection. The need for those <P>


<a name="column_672"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 672</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services is no less today than it was then and I hope a decision that seems totally inexplicable to the haemophilia community will be reversed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para45"></a>In none of the parliamentary campaigns I have been closely involved in over 34 years in Parliament--even thalidomide and that for statutory recognition of dyslexia--have I had so strong a sense that no campaigning should have been necessary to right so obvious a wrong. Enormous cross-party backing has been given by MPs to Motions calling for parity of treatment. As each successive Motion has shown, the issue is regarded not as one of Right and Left, but of right and wrong. It is just as demonstrable that, given the nod by Ministers, both Houses could end this huge scandal within an hour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para46"></a>For all of us know that in truth anyone claiming to see any difference in principle between the claims of those infected with HIV and HCV will have no difficulty whatever in spotting from afar the smallest needle in the biggest haystack.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para47"></a>There are many celebrated texts on the undoubted wrong of delaying justice. My choice today is Magna Carta which famously declares,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To no one will we delay right or justice". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para48"></a>Recognition that justice delayed is justice denied was never more relevant than it is today in the small community for whom I speak in this debate. It hopes profoundly that this opportunity will be taken to justify the new hope given to them as vulnerable people by the ministerial Statements in both Houses of Parliament on the 26th March. But if its campaign has to go on I am in no doubt--nor should anyone else doubt--that go on it will until right is done.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to my noble friend the Lord Morris of Manchester for introducing this important short debate. I have no wish to detain the House at this late hour this afternoon and I shall be brief. However, one cannot escape the terrible fact that death by liver failure or liver cancer is a particularly horrible end. There is a slow inexorable decline, with severe fatigue and malaise. Patients with these viruses are frightened about their marital relationships. They are concerned about having sex. At the same time, paradoxically and ironically, they suffer loss of libido. They feel sick, have no appetite and lose weight. If they have liver cancer often they have severe pain that is quite intractable. The end is a mixture of a decline, with mental confusion and finally coma. It is true that occasionally there are expensive opportunities for liver transplantation and dialysis, but most of these merely palliate the condition and offer control for a certain time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para49"></a>As the noble Lord has eloquently pointed out, there is no difference between HIV and hepatitis C that is produced in this way. The cause is the same, a virus, and it comes from the same source, blood products. Yet, sadly and oddly, there is discrimination by the Government. With one exception, there is no logic to it. The exception, sadly, is mere expediency. No government in this situation, quite understandably, want <P>


<a name="column_673"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 673</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to create a precedent. Therefore, my noble friend who is to reply this afternoon, although an honourable person, sadly is here to defend what is probably indefensible. The precedent is already there. The fact is that patients with HIV have already been compensated to a large extent by government action. A decision on the basis of expediency is not moral.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para50"></a>This Government came to power on a wave of moral feeling and with moral promise. The very National Health Service to which these people owe their treatment, and in this case its unfortunate outcome, is based on a moral promise of which the Government are rightly proud. It was founded on a moral principle. We on this side of the House are proud of the moral principles of this Government. But moral principles not only carry credit and bring public support but impose obligations and responsibilities. There is a price as well as an advantage in taking the moral high ground. The alternative is potentially worse. If these patients eventually resorted to litigation it could prove more expensive; certainly it would be more damaging to them as individuals and potentially more damaging to the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para51"></a>I believe that the Government need to consider more seriously the alternatives for genetic disorders like haemophilia. Here I declare an interest having been involved in genetic disorders and research into their prevention for 10 years. The fact is that it is possible, using modern embryological methods, to screen the families which are at risk and some of whom have been affected with this virus. Undertaking pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is no longer at the research stage. Indeed, in my institution the research approval on the basis of an ethical approval is now withdrawn because it is no longer seen to be a research procedure. It is a clinical procedure. That procedure costs &#163;2,500, and the alternative cost perhaps of treating somebody year after year with hepatitis, or indeed just for haemophilia, and the blood transfusions is around &#163;15,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para52"></a>The strange thing is that, although the Government came to power with a promise to abolish the internal market, it is a lottery as to whether these patients are treated by the NHS. In some parts of the country they do and in other parts they do not; but the NHS is not funded through local taxation but through national taxation, and there needs to be a national policy. I understand that the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, cannot give us any undertaking this afternoon, but I hope that she will take back this message to the Department of Health and to the Government. I have a suspicion that on all sides of the House there will be unanimous support for a manoeuvre of this kind.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that in a very straightforward debate on a straightforward problem like this, with so much expertise in front of me, there is little else I can do but agree, so I will proceed as quickly as I can. As has been stated, there is a precedent for this: a treatment for haemophilia has led to a viral infection. As has also been said before, this has happened with the AIDS virus, which may have been the causing virus, if I might try and use the correct term in such learned <P>


<a name="column_674"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 674</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>company. That has led to a variety of illnesses, sometimes resulting in death. With hepatitis C the same principle applies, except that the process is slightly different because the virus is different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para53"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, has just given us a description of how harrowing and damaging that process is. It might take longer, according to the notes that have been provided for me on this, but the principle is still there; the worry is still there; and ultimately an untimely death is still there. If we could do it once, then we can do it twice. The only real debate that is going on today is as to when compensation will be paid, because the legal precedent is there. Although we do not have our usual battery of heavy guns firing from the legal world, we all know that they will win their case in the end; even if it is not here it will be in another court--perhaps the European Court of Human Rights. It will happen. We must do something. These people are suffering because the system got it wrong. The system which said, "We will look after you" got it wrong. Whether or not the sufferers are taxpayers, they are entitled to expect the system to take care of them. And yet, that is the system which gave them a killing disease. Surely they are entitled to some support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para54"></a>The Minister may not be able to give us a positive answer today but she knows as well as everybody else that the Government will have to do something. Delay which, because of the dead hand of the Treasury, lies upon this problem as it lies upon everything, will result only in greater suffering for those who have the condition. This is not good enough, and hopefully a new Government with such a huge majority must be able to overrule the Treasury, so that the tail does not wag the dog. That is something which must be reversed in this case and action should be taken as soon as possible. We must not wait until after long and expensive legal cases have taken place. We are speaking not just in terms of money but in terms of people's lives. Ultimately people's lives must be more important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para55"></a>We have heard that it is comparatively cheap to take action by screening before the condition occurs. A little investment is required. I do not know how many times and on how many issues I have said that we should act now rather than pay later. It is invariably cheaper in the long or even medium term to put a little money up front. I hope that the Government will do something. It may be too much to hope that the Minister can answer now. However, I like to think that hope springs eternal, and that we shall hear something soon. The issue will not go away. The Government will eventually have to give ground, as sure as eggs are eggs. The legal precedents are there. I hope that we shall soon hear some positive information.

Therefore, I shall not take up much time as the issues have been laid out clearly by my colleague, and the noble Lords, Lord Morris and Lord Winston.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para56"></a>There are three specific issues. First, there is the moral question. Those of us who come into the caring professions give an undertaking that we shall try to do the best we can for those under our care, but that at the very least we shall not make their situation worse. Sometimes that is a more onerous undertaking than at first appears. Nevertheless it is an entirely proper one. A relatively small group of people, whose care was undertaken in good faith, has suffered terribly. There is a moral question there. Those who undertook the care, out of no real cause of their own, did harm. When we do harm it is incumbent upon us to put the harm right as best we can, or at least make some compensation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para57"></a>The second issue has been spoken about extensively. I refer to the fact that this group of people is not unique. Others suffer from haemophilia and have already been compensated for contracting HIV in precisely the same circumstances. In that context, it is incomprehensible that at the start of this process the decision did not ensure that those who were infected would be compensated. It is extraordinary that there was a decision to compensate one group and not another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para58"></a>My noble friend describes hope as springing eternal. I believe that we have gone as far into "eternal" as we should have to do. The hope should not have to spring any longer; it should be responded to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para59"></a>Thirdly, we should not forget that those who suffer from haemophilia have done so from before birth. They have suffered considerably already, through no fault of their own. To suffer again at the hands of those who were doing their best to care for them is an assault almost too great for anyone to be expected to bear. But to add to that by giving no compensation and steadfastly refusing time after time to recognise their predicament and to give due compensation--while on the other hand doing so for others who suffer the same type of disorder--is quite extraordinary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para60"></a>We are not talking about large amounts of money in the greater scheme of things. In my own small province of Northern Ireland, we are speaking of some 76 haemophiliacs. Let it be said that probably one-third of those who are suffering from the disorder are suffering from an infection with HCV.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para61"></a>Apart from the issue of compensation, a further problem arises. I raise the issue with the Minister and appreciate that she may be unable to respond immediately. It has been decided that the care of some of the patients will be continued at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, but that the care of others in a different age group will proceed at the Belfast City Hospital. However, the hepatologist will remain at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Therefore, some of the patients will be cared for partly in one hospital, partly in another and then back to the first.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para62"></a>A small group of people are suffering from a disorder which is not widespread and from an infection which is less likely to be attended to by the media and therefore they find themselves suffering all the more but quietly, painfully and in a very upsetting way. It is the will of your Lordships' House and it appears to be the will of the other place that this matter should be dealt with <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>speedily. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance on the matter, if not immediately at least within a timescale when the matter will be acted upon.

<A NAME="80605-16_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Morris, brings to your Lordships' House today a cause which he has consistently championed with vigour in another place for many years. For that we must be genuinely grateful. Perhaps surprisingly, the subject of today's debate has not been aired with any regularity in your Lordships' House either in this Parliament or the last. Few who have listened to the noble Lord can fail to be moved by what he said. I agree that Ministers have a duty to consider with the greatest care what options might be available to assist this most unfortunate group of individuals. Those individuals find themselves chronically and sometimes gravely ill as a direct result of treatment they received from the National Health Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para63"></a>The noble Lord is right in saying that the case he is advancing is essentially a moral issue. It is not a case which rests on any claim of negligence. The people who received contaminated Factor VIII during the 1970s and early 1980s received the best treatment available in the light of medical knowledge at that time. The techniques followed today to test and screen blood products were not available in those days. Until 1991, there were no tests to detect hepatitis C in blood donations. Indeed, very little was known about hepatitis C. The Department of Health did not know and could not have been expected to know the nature or extent of the hazards in those imported blood products.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para64"></a>In describing this as a moral issue, I must acknowledge--and I hope that I do not anticipate the Minister's remarks too closely--that it is a moral issue of a particularly complex kind. It is a matter with which Ministers in the previous government wrestled for a considerable time. That is why, for all the understandable frustrations felt by those who are looking for answers from the Government, I do not wish to criticise the Minister or her colleagues too harshly for delaying their decisions. The problem as to whether this particular medical accident--namely, the inadvertent transmission of a potentially fatal virus during routine treatment for haemophilia--is of sufficient gravity to merit exceptional recognition by the Government in the form of financial assistance for the victims.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para65"></a>As the noble Lord mentioned, the previous government recognised the exceptional suffering and hardship of the thousand or so haemophiliacs who were accidentally infected with HIV when being treated with Factor VIII blood product. There were at that time very good reasons for regarding that particular group of individuals as being unique and, therefore, worthy of a unique kind of compensation. What possible reason then could there be to withhold financial help from the other 3,000 or so people who contracted hepatitis C under exactly the same circumstances?
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para66"></a>We have heard from the noble Lord how devastating can be the effects of hepatitis C on those who succumb to it. Haemophiliacs who succumb to the virus are many <P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 677</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>times less likely to respond to treatment than non-haemophiliacs; and hence many times more likely to die from the condition. Indeed, some have already died. Like those who have died of AIDS, they have left relatives to cope without them. Others are suffering from the debilitating effects of hepatitis or cirrhosis, unable to work properly or unable to work at all and, indeed, unable to lead anything like a normal life. On the other hand, others have responded to treatment and are able to carry on with daily living in an almost normal fashion, free of all symptoms. The prognosis for these people is good.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para67"></a>One of the considerations which led Ministers in the last government to take the exceptional course of assisting HIV patients was the argument that this would not lead to similar claims from other groups. That in itself is no reason for Ministers not to entertain this further claim. As I have said, they should certainly do so. But it is a fact which serves to flag up a fundamental principle which applies to treatment delivered under the NHS--namely, that when unwanted accidents do happen (and noble Lords should note that I am talking about accidents, not acts of negligence) there has never been any question of this triggering compensation from the Government. Any medical or surgical treatment carries risks and hazards, however expert the level of care. Sometimes things go wrong that are no one's fault. So the question must be asked in relation to victims of hepatitis C: what distinguishes their accident--serious and distressing as it is--from other medical accidents? If compensation were to be paid to them, how could we resist paying compensation to someone who might have contracted a virus during a stay in hospital; or someone who died because an ambulance was unable to reach him quickly enough?
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para68"></a>We are into the realms of no-fault compensation--an idea which has been batted around the NHS for a number of years and which, as a concept, appears to be delightfully simple. If something goes wrong, it does not have to be anyone's fault. You do not need to prove negligence. You will be compensated anyway. But if one looks at this idea rather more closely, all manner of anomalies rise to the surface. In practice, we would encounter exactly the same kind of difficulty distinguishing the cases which qualified for compensation from those which did not. Such a scheme would be unworkable and unfair. We would be institutionalising a culture of claim and counter-claim, of finger pointing and finger wagging--a profoundly unhealthy culture which I believe would be deeply damaging to NHS morale.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para69"></a>If there is a genuine case to be made for hepatitis C victims--and there may be--it must be on a basis which distinguishes that group of people pre-eminently from all others. I can think of some good arguments for doing so. Not least is the fact that the infection from which they are suffering arises from a hazard whose very existence was not known about at the time the treatment was administered. It was not, in other words, "one of those accepted risks one took". It marks them out as a discrete, self-contained group. It has resulted, for many of the victims, not in a mildly annoying physical <P>


<a name="column_678"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 678</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>weakness but in a truly terrible deterioration in the quality of life, and sometimes no life at all. Those are the things I ask the Minister to reflect upon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para70"></a>It should not be a question of money. Whatever the Minister's conclusions on the matter, I hope she will not be side-tracked by worries relating to the erosion of the health budget. Funding for a special payments scheme should come from the contingency fund, which has already been mentioned, exactly on the lines of the Macfarlane Trust for HIV victims. What I hope she will say about the health budget is that substantial, meaningful money is being directed towards research into our understanding of hepatitis C, its transmission, its prevalence and the evaluation of new treatments. There is a compelling need to advance our state of knowledge about this still poorly understood condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para71"></a>This has been a useful and timely debate, and I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<A NAME="80605-16_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords who have spoken, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester, who has such an outstanding and distinguished record in furthering the cause of the disabled and other groups afflicted by serious health problems, for the opportunity he has given us today to discuss an issue of such importance and concern to those involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para72"></a>I express my appreciation to those who have contributed to this debate from such an impressive breadth and depth of professional and personal experience. The Government are, of course, aware of the widespread and deeply felt concern inside and outside this House and another place for the plight of those patients with haemophilia who were inadvertently infected with hepatitis C through blood products prior to the introduction of viral inactivation processes in 1985. It is a concern which we very much share. I can assure my noble friend Lord Morris that Ministers are fully aware of the research reports to which he referred on the effects of HIV infection on haemophiliacs and their families, as well as of the first-hand accounts from sufferers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para73"></a>The many representations both from those affected, and from others on their behalf, not least the Haemophilia Society, and of course the eloquent accounts given here today by many noble Lords have provided a clear, poignant and harrowing picture of the difficult situation which many of those infected may have to face. Indeed, it would be almost impossible to fail to sympathise with this group, or with the distress of any patients who, already having to cope with one condition, find that the treatment for that disorder has given them another. Many noble Lords have made that point today. I do not believe anyone would disagree with that. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, referred to the problem in Northern Ireland. I cannot comment on that because the Department of Health is not responsible for that. However, I shall certainly draw his comments to the notice of the relevant authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para74"></a>Many of the representations which we have received have raised the issue of extra help, mainly in the form of financial assistance, for those directly affected. In some <P>


<a name="column_679"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 679</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases--as indeed is the case in our discussion today--help has also been requested for the dependants of those who have died.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para75"></a>I am sure all those present are aware that the question of some form of special payments scheme was one of the points raised with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health when he met the Haemophilia Society last September to hear its first-hand accounts of the effects on the lives of those with haemophilia and their families, of contracting hepatitis C. At that stage my right honourable friend told members of the Haemophilia Society that he would consider the matter very carefully and would write to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para76"></a>We know that many of those who have made representations on this subject are disappointed that this has not yet been possible, and that we have not, as yet, been able to announce our conclusions on this matter. The Secretary of State has written to the Haemophilia Society explaining the delay. In those letters, he made clear that the issues involved were very complex--as the noble Lord, Lord McColl, explained eloquently and with authority--and that the emergence of potential problems relating to new variant CJD had made the position even more complicated. Accordingly, the matter was still being considered. That remains the position. I can, however, assure the House that we shall announce the outcome of our deliberations just as soon as we are in a position to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para77"></a>At this point, perhaps I may deal with a point made by my noble friend Lord Morris about the grant to the Haemophilia Society. Section 64 grants are aimed primarily at taking forward the department's objectives through the expertise and initiatives of voluntary organisations supported by time-limited grants. The department is of the view that that is best achieved through project grants. Some &#163;60,000 of the society's grant last year was in respect of the final year of a three-year project. The Haemophilia Society did not submit another project grant application for this year, although we understand that it is currently working on some new proposals. I can assure my noble friend Lord Morris and the House that we shall be happy to consider any new application from the society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para78"></a>Before looking at one or two of the factors which make this issue such a testing one, I wish to say a few words about the vital importance of blood and blood products to the NHS. First, I should like to stress the fact that, despite the very sad subject of this debate, our UK blood supply is considered one of the very safest in the world. It is important that patients and the wider public know that. It is also very important that donors understand that we need their blood more than ever before. The need for blood for transfusions increases year on year. But that need has now grown even faster, because the NHS is treating more patients than ever before, carrying out more surgery and starting a major drive to reduce waiting lists. I therefore strongly urge those who are able to give blood, to do so, thereby helping the NHS to do its job. Giving blood is a quick and easy way of making an amazing contribution to society--that of helping to save lives.
<P>


<a name="column_680"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 680</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para79"></a>I hope that patients will also be reassured from recent precautionary steps announced by the Department of Health in relation to the theoretical risk from new variant CJD, that the Government have taken, and will continue to take, all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of blood and blood products.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para80"></a>That applies of course equally to all blood products, including Factor VIII and Factor IX, the clotting agents which many haemophiliacs need to help to control their condition. These products have helped to transform the lives of people with haemophilia by enhancing their quality of life, and also greatly increasing life expectancy. The provision of these products by the NHS has transformed haemophilia care. Greater longevity in the haemophilia community, the increasing use of prophylactic care and new developments--such as the advent of recombinant (synthetic) alternatives to the human plasma-derived clotting agents--together mean that overall spending on haemophilia care is rising at about 10 per cent. per year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para81"></a>Spending on individual patients will average between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 each year, and for a few patients this may increase to as much as &#163;500,000. I hope that that demonstrates the commitment of the NHS to people with haemophilia. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester for his expression of appreciation for the decision made by the Government that recombinant Factor VIII be made available to all children under 16 and to new patients. Sadly, I understand that approximately 80 per cent. of haemophiliacs worldwide have no access to any treatment whatsoever.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para82"></a>My noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester mentioned that the Irish Government pay what he called compensation to those who have contracted hepatitis C. It is for each country to make its own decisions in the light of specific circumstances, but most other countries have decided not to make payments to those who have contracted hepatitis C.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para83"></a>I echo what the noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, said. Those blood products were undoubtedly the best treatments available for people with haemophilia at the time that those who are infected with hepatitis C contracted the infection. Without those treatments, many people with haemophilia would not be alive today, and, if they survived, it would only be with significant and crippling damage to their health.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para84"></a>At that time, however, all the safety processes currently in operation had not become available. I am thinking specifically of the viral inactivation procedures introduced in 1985. Nor was there, at the time, any test available for detecting hepatitis C in blood donations. Such testing was introduced in 1991 as soon as reliable blood screening tests first became available. These are very important points to bear in mind when considering the issue before us today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para85"></a>My noble friend Lord Morris and several other noble Lords made the point that this position could be said to apply equally to those who contracted HIV via the same route, and yet there are schemes offering financial support to those people. He and others asked what difference there was between the position of those <P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>patients and those who contracted hepatitis C. The special payments scheme for those who contracted HIV in this way was set up in recognition of the quite exceptional circumstances involved. The unique features of the HIV claim included the stigma attached to HIV and AIDS at the time the decision to compensate was made; the public revulsion surrounding all aspects of the virus at that time; and the fact that the condition was easily transmissible to the spouses of those affected. Many of those infected and their families, including the children, found themselves totally ostracised within their communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para86"></a>The progress of the infections also differs. Past reports on clinical aspects of hepatitis C infection indicate that the natural history varies widely. About 20 per cent. of those infected may recover completely; the remainder develop chronic infection. Some of those with chronic infection are asymptomatic, some experience vague symptoms, such as fatigue, and some will have the extreme, horrible end conditions which have been described. These complications may take up to 30 years to develop.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para87"></a>I am pleased to say today that two new types of treatment for hepatitis C have recently become available which are showing impressive results. These are Interferon and effective anti-viral drugs. We understand that the evidence so far suggests that these can virtually suppress the virus in many cases and in a significant proportion of cases eliminate it altogether. These are truly remarkable developments which could change significantly the daily lives and future health and prospects of many of the people whom we are discussing today.
<P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<B>5 Jun 1998 : Column 682</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para88"></a>We should also remember that haemophiliacs are not the only patients who, despite receiving the best treatment available at the time, are claiming special help from the Government because of the consequent effects of that treatment. Those groups include non-haemophiliacs who have contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions. We need to think very carefully whether it would be fair or equitable to introduce new help which was not available to all these groups equally. We also need to consider carefully the best use of resources available to the National Health Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para89"></a>I note the point made by my noble friend Lord Winston about the importance of research into genetic disorders and of the need to co-ordinate service provisions. I also note the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McColl, on the question of research into hepatitis C.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para90"></a>Many have indicated that this is a straightforward issue. I hope that what I have said, which is confirmed by what the noble Lord, Lord McColl, so eloquently said, demonstrates that this is by no means a simple or straightforward issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605-16_para91"></a>I appreciate that the Government's response to the request for help for those infected with blood products is eagerly awaited. As I explained, we will announce our conclusion as soon as we can. I repeat that I am exceedingly grateful to my noble friend Lord Morris in particular and to all noble Lords who contributed to the debate. I can assure them that the Government will consider all their points very carefully.

<A NAME="80605w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Council discussed the development co-operation aspects of the EU's draft negotiating mandate for the renegotiation of the Lome Convention, which covers EC aid, trade and development relations with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states and expires in the year 2000. The Council held a useful discussion, resolving most of the outstanding issues on the development aspects of the mandate. Trade aspects are still to be agreed, but we are aiming to have the mandate adopted at the General Affairs Council in June.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605w01_para0"></a>The Council agreed conclusions on follow-up to the 1993 Poverty Resolution and on follow-up to the 1995 Gender Resolution. The conclusions refer to experience in implementing the resolutions and set out what more needs to be done to improve effectiveness in these key areas. Procedural conclusions were also agreed on microfinance, indigenous peoples, evaluation and humanitarian aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605w01_para1"></a>Ministers also discussed Rwanda, Nigeria, the nuclear tests in India, Cuba's request to become an observer in the negotiations on the future of ACP-EU relations, aid untying, the DAC chairmanship, the successor to the current administrator of UNDP and a proposal to set up an expert group on migration. They also agreed conclusions on the situation in southern Sudan, noting with extreme concern the grave situation there and the plight of more than 350,000 people in Bahr el Ghazal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605w01_para2"></a>The conclusions reflect the fact that the Council feels that the root of the problem there is the long-term conflict and commits the EU to continuing to provide flexible assistance, urging other donors to do the same.

<A NAME = "80605w01_para3"></a>By agreement with the authorities of both Houses, statute law repeal Bills, as opposed to more general law reform measures, must neither be controversial nor raise issues which might reasonably require debate.

<UL>Whether they accept any obligation to ensure impartiality in the conduct of the Northern Ireland referendum.[HL1891]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Lord Dubs): </B>  I can comment only on the position of the Government. I made it clear on a number of occasions prior to the referendum that our approach was to treat all the parties involved in the referendum on an equal basis. We wanted to see, and were pleased that there was, a yes vote, but we took the position throughout the campaign that how people chose to vote on 22 May was entirely a matter for them.

<P>
<UL>How they evaluate the importance and significance of integrated education in Northern Ireland in the light of current efforts to build a stable and peaceful society in the Province.[HL1972]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Integrated schools make a valuable and, in many ways unique, contribution to the improvement of community relations. The Government believe that all schools have an important part to play in developing better understanding between the two main traditions and we are actively doing so through programmes such as Education for Mutual Understanding and Cultural Heritage which are integral parts of the statutory curriculum.

<A NAME="80605w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Orme </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will issue guidance on the conduct of government business during the election campaign for the Northern Ireland assembly.[HL2137]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80605w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Richard): </B>  The business of government must, of course, continue during the election campaign period, including the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement now endorsed in
the referendums. Nevertheless, it is important that the Government conduct business in a way which does not interfere with the electoral contest between the participating candidates and parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80605w01_para6"></a>With that in mind, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has endorsed the issue of guidance to government Ministers and departments in Northern Ireland and he is arranging for copies to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
