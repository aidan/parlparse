Given the shortcomings in the care system recognised by the coalition Government, do they consider the low age of criminal responsibility in this country to be consistent internationally, when it is two years below the minimum age of 12 recommended by the committee on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child?</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="1012201000004"></a><b><a name="101220-0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1012201000191"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Earl's continuing interest in these matters. I do not think that there is a conflict between the age of criminal responsibility and the kinds of concerns that he expresses. The whole thrust of our policy is to intervene as early and as positively as possible with young offenders.  The factors that lead young people to offend are complex and can often include the circumstances that the noble Earl mentioned. That is why children who offend are referred to local multi-agency youth offending teams, which take a holistic approach to tackling the causes of offending, including housing, education, health and parenting issues.</p>

Will he look at international practices in relation to children and consider what good practices could be adopted in this country, bearing in mind that we have probably one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility?</p>

The department and all the authorities concerned look at international comparisons and practices. For the moment, we hold firm that, although the age of criminal responsibility is 10 years, the thrust of the policy when children come into the care of the authorities is not to feed them into the criminal justice system but to apply as vigorously and, as I mentioned in my previous answer, holistically as possible responses to their needs to try to avoid them reoffending.</p>

Does the Minister recognise that, while fewer children enter the criminal justice system under the age of 14 than over the age of 14, the younger the child is the more likely that she or he will go on to become prolific offenders? Will the Minister look at what money could be saved by diverting these young people into the welfare system? Does he further recognise that, once a child is drawn into the criminal justice system, he or she is likely to be there for a long

All this fits in exactly with the aims that the Minister said his department is interested in fostering. Why is he being so cautious about this one?</p>

<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="1012201000011"></a><b><a name="101220-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="1012201000198"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, I do not think that the department is being cautious. The noble Lord's first point is true: the difference in costs between putting young people into custody and finding alternative treatments is out of all proportion-it is tenfold. Therefore, there are both financial and practical attractions in this. I go back to the point that, although the age is low, the thrust of policy is in the direction that the noble Lord is pointing. For example, the pilots on intensive fostering, which were started by the previous Administration, are well worth studying and are very encouraging. The cost of intensive fostering is about a tenth of that of keeping a young person in youth custody. I accept fully his point about the danger that, once children under the age of 14 are in the criminal justice system, they will stay in it and go up the escalator of offending. That danger is very real, which is why we are trying to address these problems.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>

I accept that it is necessary to maintain a proper balance between the protection of society and the interests of a young person or child, in the context of acting humanely, but does not the Minister recognise that, whereas the average for the age of responsibility the world over is about 14, we are very much lower than that? In consequence, we incarcerate four times as many of these young people as Portugal and 25 times as many as Belgium.</p>

<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="1012201000013"></a><b><a name="101220-0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="1012201000200"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, our general record on incarceration has been questioned by my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and we have put forward proposals to try to address it. As for young people, I agree entirely. We are trying to make a system that diverts young people from criminal activity while understanding that the activities of young people can be disruptive and frightening to the general population. We have to keep that balance in addressing the issue but, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said in his supplementary, every time one looks at offending, the same three, four or five issues keep coming through: disruptive families, poor education, drugs or whatever. That suggests that the sensible thing to do  in order to attack crime rates is to address these underlying issues.</p>

Jobcentre Plus advisers and providers of the work programme will have flexibility to tailor support to customers' needs, rather than having support prescribed by central government.

That is why we recently announced that £25 million will be made available next year to help GPs to get direct access to tests for cancer without first having to make an appointment with a specialist. That money will buy up to 150,000 extra tests. We have thought round this problem-if I may put it that way-and thought around the conventional referral pathways. I believe that we will arrive at a very satisfactory result.</p>

Although some targets were considered bad, unnecessary and unproductive, others produced some good results. Will the targets be replaced by a code of practice or guidance, or will people simply be left to manage as best they can?</p>

Of course the waiting time target achieved a great deal in bringing down waits for elective procedures, but the target had some unwanted effects in that it distorted clinical priorities and, many people felt, took the focus away from many areas of care that deserved greater focus. We need to focus on outcomes for patients. Therefore, instead of setting process-based targets, our aim will be to ensure that, wherever possible, the NHS uses the measures that clinicians themselves use as a basis for improving their services-in other words, measures that are clinically credible and evidence based. That is how we have tried to frame the outcomes framework.</p>

The previous Government recognised that contestability in the provision of care was a very powerful driver to improve quality of services. I do not think that privatisation of the health service will result from the proposals. We will reach a better stage of quality in provision of care only if we allow the best providers out there to compete for services. As long as the principles of the NHS remain-which they will do under this Government-for a service free at the point of need without being based on ability to pay, we will have the NHS that we all know and love.</p>

For example, how will the abolition of the 19-minute response time to a 999 call that is not life threatening affect the health outcome for an elderly lady who has slipped and broken her wrist on the ice? Such a slip may not be life threatening, but the elderly lady may wait for quite some time for an ambulance and then wait considerably longer than four hours in accident and emergency. Is the waiting time not an outcome here? If the Government do not intend to introduce a new outcomes framework for two years, would the Government not be better to leave the current guarantees in place because we know that they ensure patient safety?</p>

For category B calls, which are serious but not immediately life threatening, Peter Bradley, who is the national ambulance director, has been working with Professor Cooke to develop a set of 11 clinical quality indicators for the ambulance service. We are clear that those indicators will provide a much better and more rounded set of objectives than a mere 19-minute response time. Of course response times are important, but there are other things that should be focused on as well. We hope to improve standards in this way as from April next year.</p>

The Government believe that ISAs should be mainstream savings products and therefore do not intend to allow shares on the Alternative Investment Market, which can be riskier and less liquid, to be qualifying investments for ISAs. Companies listed on AIM may already benefit from other incentive schemes, such as the enterprise investment scheme and venture capital trusts.</p>

The arguments for allowing AIM shares to be eligible for ISAs are, frankly, overwhelming. They are supported by the Stock Exchange and the Quoted Companies Alliance. Eligibility would widen the shareholder base, improve liquidity and facilitate fundraising. It would also be tax neutral from the Treasury's point of view. What is the logic in allowing AIM shares to be eligible for SIPPs but not for ISAs? I thought that the policy of this coalition Government was to encourage personal choice and indeed investment in our smaller growing companies.</p>

Within the range of products available, there are distinct differences between the aims of ISAs and those of other savings channels. When the ISA was introduced in 1999-and it has been an enormously successful investment channel-it was intended to be a mainstream product with easy access and liquidity. A line therefore has to be drawn between the sort of investments that are thought suitable to qualify and those that are not. AIM shares were kept out in 1999 and I believe that it is still appropriate, taking into account principally the nature of the product and the ease of access to liquidity investment, that they should be. SIPPs, which are a more sophisticated, tailored pension product with a different time horizon-for example, they do not require 30-day withdrawal-can rightly benefit from having a much wider range of investments held within them.</p>

Would he be prepared to go back to his advisers and ask them at least to reconsider his answer, as the noble Lord, Lord Lee, makes a reasonable case?</p>

We have looked at it again and I am sorry to say to both the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and my noble friend Lord Lee that I cannot hold out any other prospect. The AIM market continues to thrive. At the moment, almost 1,200 companies are quoted on it, 974 of which are UK companies, and the market is quoted at £67.6 billion, so it continues to be in good health in what I recognise are challenging investment conditions.</p>

Also, the UK Listing Authority does not usually vet the prospectus of AIM-listed companies and there is no minimum capitalisation requirement. Therefore, there are different requirements and obligations on AIM companies from those that apply to listed companies.</p>

I gently point out, however, that the last Government had from 1999 to May 2010 if they had wanted to make AIM shares eligible for ISAs, but they chose-rightly, I think-not to do so. We have not taken a decade to mull over this, but we have thought about it carefully in the last few months.</p>

I understand that the Government, or another part of them, are considering thresholds for trade union ballots. It might be useful, by the time we get to a response, to see whether that is the case and whether, if it is fit for  a goose at this time of year, it may also be fit for a gander.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="1012201000061"></a>Amendment 44, which stands in my name, would ensure that there was a majority in favour of AV in all four countries of the United Kingdom in order for the new voting system to be automatically triggered. Having heard from my noble friend Lord Lipsey at an earlier stage in this Committee, I am confident that there is no difference between the four countries on AV, so I anticipate no problems in this regard. However, it seems a sensible safeguard against the possibility, for example, of Scotland voting yes to AV by a large majority, given that Scottish Parliament elections are taking place at the same time, England then voting no but by a small margin and the Scots then holding sway over England, and not simply on the football pitch.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="1012201000062"></a>Of course, the other might happen; Wales emphatically votes no along with Scotland but England and Northern Ireland then combine to impose their yes preference on the other two countries. It is difficult to judge whether any such outcome will arise. Perhaps the Scots and the Welsh, having used variants of electoral systems over the years, will now be much more relaxed about further changes, and will understand how a more proportional and fairer system can better reflect their choices at the ballot box. On the other hand, they may feel that they have enough systems and simply do not want another. I do not claim to be an expert on this. Nor do I have any evidence of the likelihood of different turnouts or preferences across the four countries. What I do know is that there could be discontent should one of our four nations feel, having heard and seen the outcome of the four separate counts, that its will is trumped by the votes of the other nations.</p>

It may be, as happened in France, Denmark and Ireland with their European referendums at different times, that the question is adjusted in some way or is retabled, with more time for debate and persuasion: or we could consider having different election systems in the four countries-I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1012201000064"></a>However, I am clear that, given our devolved nations, it would be right to pause and consider should the results be greatly different in the four countries. As I have indicated, it is not an outcome that I foresee but it is always so much better, with good risk management, to anticipate, assess and mitigate any risk beforehand, rather than have to scrabble around afterwards making hasty corrections. It is not an impossible outcome, but it is an unlikely one, so let us give it some thought before it happens by removing the automaticity of triggering the new system should one country's voice be at variance with those of the other three. I beg to move.</p>

I am particularly pleased to respond to my noble friend Lady Hayter. It is a little known fact that explains much; we started work together in the research department of the General and Municipal Workers' Union, then under the plebeian leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Radice, around 1970. We have been arguing ever since but have remained the closest of friends, and I will argue briefly with her tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1012201000066"></a>I am always surprised when keen first past the posters argue for thresholds and various other forms of fiddling the rules. Under the first past the post system, however few votes the person who gets more votes than anyone else gets, they win. I thought that was what attracted people to that system. Nevertheless, the noble Baroness has tabled this amendment and I can see why she has done so. However, it would lead to some extraordinarily paradoxical conclusions. Let us say that the election result went as follows in an AV referendum. In England, 7 million people voted yes and 3 million people voted no-a huge victory for AV. Let us suppose that corresponding margins occurred in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but the Welsh in their wisdom-as an adopted Welshman, I think there is much wisdom in Wales-voted, on roughly the same turnout, with 251,000 against AV and 249,000 for AV. In that case the 251,000 would trump the majority of  4 million-plus in the rest of the United Kingdom, and AV would not go ahead.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1012201000067"></a>I can quite understand those who say that this should be an advisory referendum-we moved an earlier amendment to this Bill to that effect and that has good scope-but simply to do it on the basis that one country has voted yes and one country has voted no is not good cause for a review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1012201000068"></a>We are a united kingdom. Our national elections have to be run as though they were national elections for the Government of the United Kingdom, and to seek to set one nation within that kingdom against another kingdom is neither desirable nor wise. I therefore very much hope that my noble friend will not press her amendment tonight because for once in our long life I would not be able to support her in the Lobbies.</p>

It is the argument of a coalition of dinosaurs who say that in the old days you could have just two parties in a constituency. As I have argued before, one is bound to get 50 per cent. If you have 6.3 parties, which was the average in last May's election, it does not work in the same way. Nearly every member will be elected on a minority vote. We must accept that.</p>

No one mentioned a threshold-no one was going to risk doing that-so it was carried in some counties and not in others. There was no threshold. Then we came to the European Union and whether we stayed in or stayed out. There was no talk of a threshold there. The only talk of a threshold was in the first referendum on devolution. Then you had a threshold, and both Scotland and Wales failed to reach it. Then came the next referendum on devolution, and there was no threshold. I am told that when Northern Ireland had its Good Friday referendum, there was no threshold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1012201000073"></a>Why are we making this exception now? We are doing so purely to try to destroy this AV proposal, and nothing else. I can see the argument going thus-let us delay the Bill and talk at length so we miss that May deadline. That would mean that the turnout would be down, perhaps in October, and it would be said that not enough people voted this time; perhaps only 20 per cent voted.</p>

Therefore you would not need a threshold. In the autumn, however, you might say that only 25 per cent have voted, as they might, and then we need a threshold. This seems to me

The reality is that this is an extraordinary Bill. It is the first time in my 30 years in Westminster that we are considering a Bill when we know that the Government-the Conservative element in the Government-are by an overwhelming majority opposed to the provisions in the Bill. I bet that if we were to have a free vote in the House of Lords, no more than a dozen Conservative Members would vote in favour of the referendum provision. In other words, this is a totally artificial debate. The Liberals are opposed because they have always been opposed. The Conservatives are opposed because they do not like AV at all and do not want any change from first past the post. To be frank, those on my own Benches are relatively divided on the issue.</p>

That was the figure that I picked, but if the overall turnout were to be as low as 18 or 19 per cent-as it was in some wards in Manchester that I checked on last week-you could find that approval in some parts of the country was as low as 10 per cent, representing only one in 10 voters.</p>

My experience, among others, is that of the Welsh referendum in 1997 where, although there was a massive media campaign in Wales-it was the big issue-by all parties urging their supporters to vote in favour, the turnout was only 50 per cent of the electorate of Wales, and of that 50 per cent, 25 per cent plus one, or whatever, voted for, and 25 per cent voted against. If, therefore, one seeks to transpose that result of 1997 to today, amid the welter of concerns about cuts to housing benefit, the welfare state and so on, I cannot imagine, save for a small beltway or M25 elite, that there will be much interest in a referendum, and certainly very little interest in Scotland and Wales. I stand to be corrected by my noble friend Lord Foulkes, who feels the pulse of Scotland rather better than I do, but we have to look at this reasonably.</p>

I think it would be impertinent of us simply to say that we are integrationists and that we believe in the union, and not recognise that much has happened over the past 10 years or so. There is a distinct identity, which is why I am just a little puzzled-indeed, shocked-by what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, had to say. Normally, he is desperately keen to find any difference between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom-what in France they would call l'exception française. There is always something that one needs to find in respect of Wales being different from the rest of the United Kingdom. Now, with his zeal for constitutional reform, he is prepared to forget all that and go forwards juggernaut-like, forgetting that the interests of Wales, which may be very different, could well be trampled upon in this case. I said I would be brief and shall stop at this point. I simply say that I am mildly shocked at the unwillingness of my compatriot to look, as he does normally, at the Welsh exception.</p>

So there are two issues before the House: one is a threshold and the other is whether that threshold should apply individually in the different constituent parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1012201000106"></a>On the threshold, I spoke at some length on Wednesday, and I shall not repeat what I said, even for the benefit of those who did not have the joy of listening to me on that occasion. I would for once, and for perhaps the first time over many years, seek to cross swords with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno. As far as I am concerned, this is one of the most important constitutional issues imaginable. The Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats is absolutely correct in saying that it is the greatest constitutional issue since 1832. Therefore, accepting that, as I do with total sincerity, I am sure that the noble Lord will accept the sincerity of those of us who believe that it has to be dealt with in a very careful and special way. There is the remote possibility that only a very low percentage of the total electorate will turn out to vote. It could be on account of general apathy or it could possibly be on account of vicissitudes of weather. Just imagine if four inches of rain fell in two or three

Worse still, there could be an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in rural areas, paralysing all movement there. That has happened twice in the past 43 years. These are possibilities.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1012201000107"></a>The case I put on Wednesday I shall repeat in a few sentences. It is insurance against something that is only remotely possible, but if it did happen, it would be utterly disastrous. When we insure our houses against fire, we do not do so because there is a certainty that fire will occur, unless of course there is some sort of criminal intent. We do so not because we believe there is an even chance that fire will break out, or even that there is a remote chance of it. We do so because of the fraction of 1 per cent of a chance that it will happen, and in the main we pay a small and reasonable premium to guard against such a cataclysm. That is the basis on which these amendments should be considered in relation to thresholds.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1012201000108"></a>Secondly, this is not something that has been thought up out of the blue. Practically every country in the developed world has a threshold in respect of constitutional change. It is we who would be out of kilter if we reject this proposal, not the other way around. Indeed, it would be not only imprudent but arrogant of us to dismiss completely the prudent and responsible attitude of other countries in this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, in a most persuasive speech last Wednesday, pointed out exactly how other countries in the developed world look at this matter.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1012201000109"></a>On whether the threshold should apply to the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom, the argument I would put forward briefly is this. We are a United Kingdom, but we are not a dull, grey, homogenous mass. In other words, the constituent parts have their splendidly different and wonderfully distinctive characteristics that make up the real wealth and attractiveness of the United Kingdom. While it may not be perfect, this sort of amendment endorses that very principle. In that situation, therefore, I believe that it would be chivalrous, just and proper for thought to be given to an amendment of this nature.</p>

But the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has demonstrated the connection between the amendment moved by the noble Baroness and the issue of thresholds. Because I spoke last week, I certainly will not go over the arguments, but I want to comment on two points made by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde in reply to that debate. He argued that if you have a threshold relating to turnout, that just encourages people to abstain. He repeated the argument several times, saying that people will think that all they need to do is to abstain and the referendum will be rejected, but my noble friend Lord Lawson pointed out that that is not necessarily how it would go. It might well go in the other direction. He pointed out that, for example, there would be people who were against change but  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_835"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 835</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who believed that the threshold will be met and therefore will have an added inducement to vote. That is one category of people who would have an inducement to vote. Secondly, there could be a group of people who are in favour but know that if they do not vote, they may lose the issue. So it can work in several ways.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1012201000111"></a>I made the point that in 1979, when we did have a threshold, the turnout then was 63 per cent-very high, even though there was a threshold-and that when the subsequent referendum was held without a threshold, the turnout was actually lower at 60 per cent. So in the particular case of the referendums in Scotland, when we did have thresholds, the turnout was higher. The noble Lord may say that that was an outcome threshold not a turnout threshold-and that is true-but I would argue that the effects of the threshold there are also ambiguous. If the noble Lord thinks that an outcome threshold that is something like the Cunningham amendment, with 40 per cent of the electorate required to vote yes, would encourage a high turnout, why do we not have that kind of threshold rather than a turnout threshold? The argument that a threshold encourages abstention is not very persuasive.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1012201000112"></a>The second point made by the noble Lord in reply to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, was that the Labour Government had been elected by only 21.6 per cent in 2005. If that did for them and the noble and learned Lord was happy with that, why was he not happy with 21.5 per cent in a referendum?</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1012201000113"></a>A referendum is different from a general election. In a general election, Members of Parliament are up for election and may be up for re-election; a constitutional change is likely to be permanent and difficult to reverse. Secondly, even with 21.6 per cent in 2005, the turnout threshold put forward in the amendments would have been met anyway. There is obviously a difference between 21.6 per cent when at least three parties, and possibly four or five, are standing, and 21.6 per cent in relation to a yes/no proposition. Neither of the arguments the noble Lord puts forward against thresholds is persuasive.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="1012201000114"></a>I do not know whether or not we will have to vote on this but, on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, that we did not have thresholds in previous referenda, although we did have one in relation to the Scottish referendum, one cannot think of a country in Europe that does not have a qualified majority provision for changes in the constitution. I shall be interested in what my noble friend says in reply to these points.</p>

First, she has reminded us that in legislating, particularly on constitutional matters, we should be sensitive to sentiment in the different nations of the United Kingdom. We needed to be sensitive to that sentiment 10 years ago, which is why we brought in devolution; and, in the context of devolution, and after 10 years' experience of it, it is all the more important that we should be so. However, the legislation proposed by the Government fails to be sensitive in that important regard. Under their model, a majority in the United Kingdom as a whole would trump a no

In that way we risk alienating national opinion and national sentiment in whatever part of the country it was-it might be Wales or Scotland-that found its wishes thus crudely overruled.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1012201000116"></a>The second important thing that my noble friend's amendment does is to underline that whatever the result of the referendum and however the procedures might be amended in this legislation, if we then went on to have a referendum under whatever set of rules, the result is liable to be divisive. It would be divisive in the case of a particular country of the United Kingdom having its wishes on the electoral system overruled; and, equally, under my noble friend's amendment, it would be divisive because what she proposes would mean that where there was a no vote in any individual part of the United Kingdom, that would trump the yes vote across the wider United Kingdom and invalidate yes votes in other parts of the United Kingdom. That cannot be a happy outcome either.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1012201000117"></a>A third way in which it would be possible to go, although it is not proposed in the amendment, is for each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom to determine its own electoral system. In those parts of the kingdom that voted for AV, general elections would in future be conducted on the basis of AV; in those parts which preferred first past the post, they would continue to elect their Members of Parliament on the basis of first past the post. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, smiles at the evident fatuity of such a scheme, yet I do not know whether he entirely rules out the possibility of two classes of Member coming to this House of Parliament, some elected, some appointed, because he very wisely does not show his hand and delays doing so for as long as he can.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="1012201000118"></a>The only circumstance in which a referendum on the voting system would not be divisive and set parts of the United Kingdom at odds with each other would be the eventuality of every part of the United Kingdom voting the same way, either for AV or first past the post. It is reasonable to think that that is rather an unlikely outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1012201000125"></a>The amendment of my noble friend Lady Hayter  is an ingenious way to introduce another version of  a threshold, which is that there would have to be a majority in each constituent part of the United Kingdom.

We get these continual charges of filibustering-that all we are doing is following a master plan to delay the Bill and kill it. I am in two minds about changing the date of the referendum. I am in two or three minds, because one part of me thinks that if the referendum were to be held on 5 May, it would be thrashed. So there is some temptation there, but I keep coming up against what I believe is a constitutional outrage, which is to try to impose that referendum on the same day as elections in the devolved countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="1012201000130"></a>I wish the Liberals would stop talking about filibustering; this is a party that wants PR.

I wish that the Liberals would be politically honest and admit that they do not have much time for AV; they regard it as delivering a battering ram against the system of elections in this country and believe that it will be a magnificent stepping stone to the Valhalla of proportional representation. They are living in cloud-cuckoo-land and should stop wasting people's time.</p>

We have something precious here in the United Kingdom-I believe that strongly-and we should be very careful about tipping the dish out, in the memorable phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. We should handle this carefully so that we can keep all the constituent parts of this United Kingdom. Any major constitutional change, which everybody says this is, should be handled very carefully. Balance, cohesiveness and the safeguarding of this special thing we have, called the United Kingdom, should be at the forefront of people's minds.</p>

To the extent that the amendment detracts from that, it is not one that I can support. However, my noble friend has done the House a very good service in that she has reminded the Government, who do not seem to be in the mood to listen, that time and again, in responding to amendments, the Government have walked up one of two blind alleys.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1012201000133"></a>One blind alley is their absolute commitment to a referendum next May, which is presenting them with difficulty after difficulty; not silly difficulties, not trivial difficulties, but very substantial difficulties indeed.

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1012201000134"></a>The second blind alley is best illustrated by my noble friend's amendment. The Government are committed to this being a legislative referendum, not an indicative referendum. If this were an indicative referendum where the results were sensibly considered and analysed by Parliament and the Government after the figures had come in, there would be absolutely no need for my noble friend's amendment even to be considered. Precisely those types of arguments would come up in the post-referendum debate that should be held about the significance of the public's decision. Clearly, it would be a matter of concern to almost anyone if strong votes against changing the voting system from the electors of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were trumped by a strong vote in favour from the electorate in England. Whatever were the numbers when you added them all up, I should have thought that that would be a matter of real concern and something that any prudent Government would want to take into account in deciding what to do next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="1012201000135"></a>Am I the only one who so dislikes Clause 8(1)? That this is not an indicative referendum is encapsulated in this one line:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="1012201000156"></a>"The Minister must make an order bringing into force".</p>

<p><a name="1012201000152"></a>Why bother the Minister? Why not press a button? There is no decision to make. The Minister presumably just stamps whatever referendum result comes for him or her to consider. He should not draw much of a salary for that part of his activities when he is told by an Act of Parliament what he must decide to do. I appreciate why my noble friend has tabled the amendment, but it is not one that I can support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1012201000136"></a>I say to those of us who were here sleepless the other night that it is not my intention to press my Amendment 44B on a 50 per cent threshold, but as thresholds have been mentioned I want to make one point very briefly. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, who has been assiduous in attendance here is not with us today, but he made a point that was worthy of consideration in opposing a 50 per cent threshold. He simply asked the House whether it would not be very unjust if, with a turnout threshold, 49 per cent of the electorate voted in favour of a constitutional change. That would mean that 98 per cent of those who voted were in favour of constitutional change. I wish a bookie would let me have a bet on that not happening. The noble Lord was proposing that 49 per cent might vote yes, and if no one voted no-or 0.5 per cent voted no-that would not carry.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="1012201000137"></a>Of course the answer to that has already been given in an exchange between the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, and the Leader of the House. If we had an outcome threshold and the outcome was 25 per cent, surely even the most fervent supporter of changing the electoral system could not object to such a threshold. All we would be asking is for one in four of the public to be in favour of change. That would also deal with the point about abstentions. Deliberate abstentions would not

That might be a first for me, but I am a moderniser. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I could have a discussion about whether the sensible thing to do would be to table an amendment for an outcome threshold of 25 per cent. That would solve his sleepless nights worrying about what would happen if there were 49 per cent of the electorate voting for a change in the voting system which could not carry because of a turnout threshold. We would both be happy and my aim in life is to make people happy.</p>

One of the reasons why I did not move Amendment 43A is that there is a legal contractual arrangement between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats not to do that. Even before they introduced the Bill, they had a contractual arrangement that they would not consider that kind of threshold. So we are stuffed before we start. If that is not the case, we will receive advice on it, but, as far as I know, the so-called coalition agreement rules that out.</p>

It is a dog's breakfast-and it is a very dangerous dog's breakfast. I would not like to feed it to my dog. There are a lot of unexpected consequences to this Bill. The law of unexpected consequences is bad enough with a small Bill, but with this Bill of 301 pages there will be many unexpected consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="1012201000147"></a>I have been listening to the debate on this important amendment, which was proposed by my noble friend Lady Hayter of Kentish Town. That is a lovely part of London, incidentally. When I was at school in London I used to wander around Kentish Town from time to time. The noble Lord, Lord Wills, made a very important point. The nature of the union has changed dramatically over the past 12 years. We certainly need to take account of it. Most of the referenda we were talking about related to devolution or preceded the changes that have taken place. We are now talking about a very important thing. I very seldom disagree with my noble friend Lord Grocott, but I ask him and others to consider the sensitivity of the particular parts of the union-of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Let us imagine that this referendum takes place. There could be a low turnout or there might be a bigger turnout if there is voting on other things and if it is on the same day. I hope fervently, like so many noble Lords, that it is not on the same day, but if it does take place on the same day, there might be a differential turnout-perhaps a substantially differential turnout. Imagine the situation where Scotland voted to keep first past the post, Wales voted to keep first past the post, Northern Ireland voted to keep first past the post, but AV-I was going to say this bastard of a system, but I must not say that-this awful system that we have been discussing at length, was imposed on the whole of the United Kingdom by a vote in England that would-</p>

I am very glad to see the noble Lord here. Having served with him in the House of Commons, I have great respect for him, especially as so many of the reforms in the House of Commons came from him. However, my recollection is that the reforms that he introduced in the House of Commons were brought in after careful thought, after much discussion and after cross-party deliberation-unlike those in the Bill. No doubt whoever is replying to the debate on the amendment will bear that point in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10122019000002"></a>My noble friend Lady Hayter of Kentish Town has raised a very important point. Incidentally, I thought that it was with great ingenuity that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, brought in the whole question of thresholds, which we have previously debated. I hope that at some point-I do not know whether that will be now or later this evening or on Report-we will be permitted to vote on the matter in Amendment 44A, because it is important that we should consider the question of thresholds. However, on the more important issue today concerning the result in the four countries that comprise the United Kingdom, I think that my noble friend Lady Hayter has done this House a great service in moving Amendment 44.</p>

I note two points in particular: first, that the noble Lords, Lord Tebbit and Lord McAvoy, appeared to agree on practically everything, excepting a marginal disagreement on the vote on joining the European Union; and, secondly, that the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, with a straight face described himself as a moderniser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10122019000004"></a>In Amendment 44, my noble friend Lady Hayter proposes that, in order for the referendum vote to effect a change in the voting system, there must be a yes vote in all four countries of the United Kingdom. As such, this is another debate on whether special barriers should need to be overcome before the voting system can be changed. In looking at the Bill, one of the roles of the House of Lords must be to ensure the correct constitutional proprieties. Whether one looks at the proposals in the Bill that was introduced before the general election or the proposals in this Bill, there is a constitutional piece of trickiness going on. Neither House of Parliament has said that it wants AV, so the proposal has not been endorsed by Parliament, in contradistinction to the proposal on membership of the European Union, which was endorsed by Parliament, and the devolution changes, which were endorsed by Parliament in 1999.</p>

The proposal does not have the support of Parliament and, as my noble friend Lord Anderson has pointed out, does not have the support of any individual party.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10122019000007"></a>Suppose that, in a referendum with no threshold where implementation was compulsory, the turnout was 40 per cent. In that case, a result could be reached in which only 20 per cent of the country had voted in favour of AV. When we debated-last Wednesday, I think-my noble friend Lady Hayter's Amendment 43, we heard how that proposal for a 25 per cent threshold could have produced a situation in which the change was effected if only 13 per cent of the population voted in favour of the proposition. Most countries in the world-sensibly, in my view-make it harder to change the constitution than to make other sorts of legislative change. The Government's extraordinary proposal could lead to a change following a tiny proportion voting yes. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, with characteristic robustness and honesty, took pleasure in the fact that, if 13 per cent voted in favour of the change in the voting system, the result could indeed be that the voting system should change. The only occasion when any sort of threshold has been required for a referendum that would have changed our constitution was on the only previous occasion on which implementation of the referendum decision was compulsory rather than indicative. I was not in the House of Commons in 1978 or 1979 but many who are here were, and all of them who have spoken have said that the Member for Islington South, Mr George Cunningham, persuaded people on a free vote that, when changing the constitution under such a proposal-which people thought might lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom-there has to be legitimacy. On the face of it, the effect of the Government's proposal is a manoeuvre that could lead to a change in our constitution.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10122019000008"></a>However, there is no point in debating whether Mr Nick Clegg is correct in saying that the proposal is the most important change since 1832. I do not think that anyone doubts that the proposal is an important change, but if the public think that it is the wrong change, they will not like it and their distrust of Parliament will increase. Our role in the Lords is to make the Commons think again, particularly in relation to the constitution, if we think that they have got it wrong. Our debate on the issue last Wednesday-I single out in particular the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont-demonstrated the constitutional trickiness of the proposal. The fact that we could end up with Parliament not approving-and, indeed, probably being against-the proposed system but a tiny amount of the population being persuaded to vote for it shows that something has gone wrong in the way that we are dealing with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10122019000009"></a>The proposal of my noble friend Lady Hayter is that, for the referendum to have effect, every country in the United Kingdom must vote yes. I tend towards the view that that is not the right answer because, in my view, we should do everything to promote coherence in the United Kingdom. That means that, where we are voting on a national voting system, implementation of any referendum should be guided by what the

Therefore, I would reject that approach. However, I am extremely keen that whoever replies from the Front Bench on behalf of the coalition should deal with the points that I have made. As the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, we debated the issue late at night last Wednesday and this is a point of real importance in relation to the constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10122019000010"></a>Finally, I want to pick up on what my noble friend Lord Rooker said about there being a legal and binding agreement between the members of the coalition not to agree to any outcome threshold. Of course, he is wrong about there being a legal agreement, because we are talking about politics here. I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has returned for the end of the debate. It may be that, having heard the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, or the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness-whichever of them is answering the debate-will think that there are things more important than simply the terms of an agreement that was reached over a few days. I have in mind in particular a change to our constitution, which people of this country respect.</p>

When I first saw it, I thought it was possibly imaginative, possibly a little bizarre. I am not sure that I came to a conclusion as to which it was during the course of the debate but I became convinced it was flawed. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, agreed with me on that, as did other notable noble Lords from the other side, including the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Grocott, and, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, as well. I therefore very much hope that, when it comes to deciding what to do with it, the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10122019000012"></a>I was not planning on being drawn into a larger debate on thresholds. We discussed it well the other night. It is, however, worth making one or two points. The best suggestion to come out of this debate was that the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, and my noble friend Lord Tyler should get together over the Christmas period and discuss whether there could be some areas of agreement between them. If I may speak for my noble friend Lord Tyler in his absence, I am sure he will wish to take up the noble Lord's invitation, and I hope to hear the good results from that discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10122019000013"></a>I hope the House, including my noble friend Lord Lamont and others, do not think that I do not understand why imposing a threshold might appear initially attractive. On the surface, it may seem to offer an extra layer of reassurance, particularly if the change that is being put to the vote is one that you personally do not favour. However, it is the Government's firm view that if people want change-if a simple majority of those who turn out to vote want change-we should not deny them this by imposing artificial barriers. We have not specified a voter turnout threshold because we want to respect the will of the people who do vote in the referendum without conditions or qualifications.</p>

I was interested to see there evidence that might indicate the beginning of some flexibility in the Government's view on thresholds in referendums. Perhaps it is just a case of double standards, I do not know. Clause 41 of the Localism Bill is entitled "The required percentage". It requires that, for a petition for a local referendum to be valid, no less than 5 per cent of registered electors must vote for it. The noble Lord would be entitled to say that a petition is quite a different thing from a referendum, but then we go  on to Clause 51, "Voting in and conduct of local referendums". Here we find that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10122019000415"></a>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to the conduct of local referendums".</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10122019000015"></a>The clause goes on to say in subsection (5):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10122019000416"></a>"Regulations under this section may apply or incorporate, with or without modifications or exceptions, any provision of any enactment (whenever passed or made) relating to elections or referendums".</p>

<p><a name="10122019000016"></a>Do I see in that the kernel of some rethinking on the part of the Government about the possibility of thresholds making sense in referendums? Of course, the Localism Bill deals only with local referendums. If the Government do not believe in thresholds, presumably they ought to be consistent. Will the noble Lord say categorically that, whatever powers the Secretary of State might use-the powers given to him in the Bill are almost universal-to alter the rules on referendums in the local context, the Government will never in any circumstances institute a threshold?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10122019000030"></a>We will come back to thresholds on Report; this is an important debate to have. There was no threshold in 1975 in the only national referendum that we have held. The Opposition's ardour for thresholds did not apply in 1997 and 1998 in their four referendums in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. There has been no proposal from any major political party for a threshold in the referendum in Wales next March that would extend the powers of the National Assembly. Most tellingly, when AV was proposed in the Bill before Parliament, there was no threshold in that either.</p>

Does he not acknowledge, as the Deputy Prime Minister has done, that this is the greatest reforming measure since 1832? Since the 1970s it has become a convention, when major constitutional matters are being considered, that there be consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny. There has been neither consultation on, nor pre-legislative scrutiny of, this legislation.</p>

He says that voting for the Cunningham amendment was motivated just by opportunism. He has, not I am sure with any malicious or impolite intention, also implied that those who have argued for a threshold in these debates have done so because they are against AV. However, will he not address some of the arguments on their own merits? For example, does not the fact that almost every European country has a qualified majority for constitutional change show that there is something in this argument?</p>

However, I largely stand by the fact that most of those who speak in favour of a threshold tend to be those who are most opposed to the policy of having a referendum or who are against AV, which is why they want a qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10122019000039"></a>My noble friend asked an interesting question about what happens in other European countries. The answer is that different countries do different things. Let us take just one example. I think I am right in thinking that France requires a majority in Parliament for making constitutional change, but does not require a threshold when there is a national referendum. I am sure that we could trade statistics from around the world about different countries doing different things, but France is an example of it being done in that way.</p>

In France, changes in the electoral system have become a plaything of whichever Government are in power, partly because there are not the constitutional barriers to mucking about with voting that have always existed in this country.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10122019000042"></a>I think that everyone now knows what the amendment would do. It would require a majority vote in favour in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, rather than a simple majority. We cannot contemplate a system whereby 100 per cent of voters in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland vote in favour of a proposal, only for it to be rejected because only 49 per cent of voters in Wales agree with them. I know that that is an extreme example, but it could be the effect of the amendment and it none the less highlights the fundamentally undemocratic consequences of this proposal. That is why the coalition agreement commits us to providing for a simple-majority referendum on the alternative vote, without qualification.</p>

However, does he not accept that whatever the view about a threshold, a differential result in each of the constituent nations of the union could have profound implications for our United Kingdom-for the union? He must accept that. It is a logical assumption to make. If he accepts that, why does he reject the proposition? Is it not more reasonable for Parliament, the acme of our representative democracy, to assess those results, know what they are and then judge how to proceed? Is that not the most sensible way forward?</p>

If the majority of those taking part in a referendum vote "yes", is it not right that Parliament accepts that result and carries on? That seems to be the fundamental position and it is why we resist the amendment, as we have resisted other amendments made here and in another place. We think that if we introduced these thresholds, they would have undesirable consequences, compromising public confidence in the legitimacy of the outcome. We want to respect, without conditions or qualifications, the will of the people who vote in the referendum, and I believe that a simple majority is  the fairest way of doing so. I therefore urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Of course, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, played a different role in 1978, and each will have their memories of that referendum. We have also heard the history of my noble friend Lord Lipsey and me. He recalled that we met in 1970 but the date was actually 4 August 1970. We have heard stories of the misspent youth of my noble friend Lord Foulkes in Kentish Town, and even West Country lingo, which I shall not repeat in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10122019000046"></a>The essence of the debate has clearly been far more important than those personal recollections. One of the interesting questions was put by the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, who asked whether one vote was enough, to which the answer is clearly "yes". Perhaps that is why Members of your Lordships' House will have a vote in the referendum-because the Government may be dependent on every last vote. I always wondered why we suddenly got into that.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10122019000047"></a>It has been said by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer that neither House has come out in favour of AV. Indeed, as I think my noble friend Lord Howarth added, nor has any party has come out in favour of it. The Labour Party never even discussed it. I was chair of the Labour Party at that time and it was the party in Parliament that first decided to have a referendum. However, the party as such has not taken a view on it. That is quite correct; it does not have to do so. Individual members' views will be known but it will certainly not be a collective view.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10122019000048"></a>I think my noble friend Lord Lipsey suggested that I was a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of first past the post due to having tabled this amendment. However, that is not the case. I marginally favour first past the post over AV but I can live with AV. I am a passionate supporter of the constituency link but of course that matter will not be in front of us today. However, I do not think that the allegation is that I am doing this because I have a particular view on that. I do not think that this is a bizarre amendment, as the Leader of the House referred to it. Rather, as my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport said, we should be sensitive to the sentiments of each of the four countries, especially if, in the voting, one of them is out of line with the others. We should respect the results in each of the four countries for this outcome to have legitimacy. That does not mean that we necessarily stop the train; it means that we have time to pause and consider, and really all that the amendment asks is for the Government and Parliament to have time to pause and consider.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10122019000049"></a>This is not an amendment about thresholds. As most Members of the Committee will know, I tabled one such amendment last week. It was very modest, and in fact I was ticked off by some of my noble friends as it referred to only a 25 per cent threshold. However, that was last week and this amendment is different: it avoids the risk of an abstention counting as a "no" vote; it is about the result, not the turnout; and, as has been said, it bypasses any difficulties with the wording that the coalition may have. It is essentially, as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, an insurance against the irreversible change that the referendum might make. We could, of course, have different systems. I do not agree that just because it is one House there must be one system. I worked for a long time in the European Parliament where we had completely different systems that brought Members to the European Parliament. We lived quite happily with that result.</p>

<a name="10122019000052"></a><b><a name="101220-0001.htm_spmin9"></a><a name="10122019000496"></a>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Lord Strathclyde):</b> My Lords, it may be a convenient moment to repeat a Statement that has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10122019000053"></a>"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on last week's European Council. Britain had three objectives at this Council. First, to bring stability to the eurozone, which is in Britain's interests; secondly, to make sure that Britain is not liable for bailing out the eurozone when the new permanent arrangements come into effect; and, thirdly, to build on the progress we made with the 2011 EU budget, with tougher settlements in the years to follow.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10122019000054"></a>Let me address each objective in turn-first, stability in the eurozone. No one can doubt this is in our interests. Nearly half our trade is with the eurozone, London is Europe's international financial centre, and no one can deny that the eurozone faces very real challenges at the moment. We see that in the Irish situation and with Spain and Portugal paying interest rate penalties in the financial markets. Britain's approach should not be simply to say, 'We told you monetary union would require fiscal union', and leave it at that. We want to help the eurozone to deal with the issues it faces.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10122019000055"></a>The fact that we have set out a path to deal with our deficit and seen our interest rates come down is helpful. Following the dinner at which leaders of all the EU countries had a wide-ranging discussion on the state of the eurozone, eurozone leaders issued a statement saying they,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000428"></a>'stand ready to do whatever is required',</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000401"></a>to return the eurozone to stability. Part of that is a permanent mechanism for assisting eurozone countries that get into financial difficulty.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10122019000056"></a>Enabling eurozone countries to establish such a mechanism is in our interests, but how this mechanism is brought about is equally important. After the October Council I made it very clear to the House that any possible future treaty change would not affect the UK, and that I would not agree to it if it did. I also said clearly that no powers would be transferred from Westminster to Brussels.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10122019000057"></a>At this Council we agreed the establishment of a permanent mechanism with a very limited treaty change. This change does not affect the United Kingdom and it does not transfer any powers from Britain to the European Union.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_852"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 852</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10122019000058"></a>Secondly, on the issue of liability for any potential bailout of the eurozone in future, Britain is not in the euro, and we are not going to join the euro. That is why we should not have any liability for bailing out the eurozone when the new permanent arrangements come into effect in 2013. With the current emergency arrangements, established under Article 122, we do. This was a decision taken by the previous Government. It is a decision we disagreed with at the time and we are stuck with it for the duration of the emergency mechanism, but I have been determined to ensure that, when the permanent mechanism starts, Britain's liability should end. That is exactly what we agreed.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10122019000059"></a>The Council conclusions state that this will be a,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000429"></a>'stability mechanism for member states whose currency is the euro'.</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000402"></a>This means it is a mechanism established by eurozone countries for eurozone countries, and Britain will not be a part of it. Crucially, we have also ensured that the current emergency arrangements are closed off when the new mechanism comes into effect in 2013.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10122019000060"></a>Both the Council conclusions and the introduction to the actual decision to change the treaty itself-the actual document that will be presented to this Parliament for its assent-are clear that Article 122,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000430"></a>'will no longer be needed for such purposes',</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000403"></a>and that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10122019000417"></a>'Heads of State or Government therefore agreed that it should not be used for such purposes'.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10122019000061"></a>So both the Council conclusions and the decision that introduces the treaty change state in black and white the clear and unanimous agreement that from 2013 Britain will not be dragged into bailing out the eurozone. Before the Government agree to this treaty change, Parliament must first, of course, give its approval, and if this treaty change is agreed by all member states then its ratification in this country will be subject to the terms of our EU Bill and so will be subject to primary legislation.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10122019000062"></a>Thirdly, let me turn to the issue of the EU budget. Securing a tight budget for the future remains my highest priority for the EU. I believe it is a priority shared by the vast majority of the country. At the last Council, we managed to do something we have not done in previous years. We were faced with a situation where the Council had agreed a 2.91 per cent increase. This was not the UK's position. We had wanted a tougher settlement, but were outvoted, yet the Parliament went on and called for 6 per cent increase, but instead of just splitting the difference between what the Council asked for and what the Parliament called for-which is what happened last year-Britain led an alliance of member states to decisively reject the European Parliament's request. We insisted on no more than the 2.91 per cent increase the Council had previously agreed. Many predicted this would be impossible and that Britain would be defeated, but this will save the British taxpayer several hundred million pounds. We also agreed a new principle that from now on the EU budget must be in line with what we are doing in our countries.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10122019000063"></a>We did this by taking the initiative and galvanising others to join us, and we sent a clear message that when we are making cuts at home, with tough decisions  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_853"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 853</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on pensions, welfare and pay, it is simply not acceptable to go on spending more and more and more through the European Union. At this Council, I wanted to keep up the momentum on the EU budget by forging an alliance with like-minded partners and starting to work towards securing a tougher settlement for future budgets. At the weekend, Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and I, together with the Prime Ministers of Finland and the Netherlands, sent a letter to the President of the European Commission. This letter sets out our goals for the budgets for 2012 and 2013 and the longer-term financial perspective covering the rest of this decade. It states clearly our collective view that,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000431"></a>'the action taken in 2011 to curb annual growth',</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000404"></a>in European spending should be "stepped up" in 2012 and 2013, and we call for a real-terms freeze in the period from 2014 to 2020. I want to achieve a decade of spending restraint in Europe, and the three biggest powers in Europe, the three biggest net contributors to the budget, have committed to that. This is an important step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10122019000064"></a>There are two problems that Europe must urgently address. First, the eurozone is not working properly. It needs major reform, and it is in our interests not to stand in the way of that. Indeed, as I have argued, we should be actively helping the eurozone to deal with its issues. Secondly, Europe as a whole needs to be much more competitive. Collectively we must press ahead with measures which will help European countries pay their way in a world where economic competition internationally is becoming ever fiercer. We must expand the single market in areas such as services, press forward on free trade and, crucially, avoid burdening businesses with costly red tape. We must promote stability, jobs and growth. That is the agenda this Government are pursuing in Europe, and I commend this Statement to the House".</p>

There are three issues that I would like to ask him about. The first is the agreement on the European budget, the second is treaty change, and the third is the wider but most fundamental question of European growth.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10122019000068"></a>I turn first to the European budget. I welcome the call for restraint in the years ahead. On the budget for this year, the Prime Minister applauded the outcome because, as he said, it avoided the ultimate sin of European negotiations; that of simply splitting the difference between positions. I would remind the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that the Prime Minister originally wanted a freeze on the budget while the European Parliament wanted a 5.9 per cent increase, and the Prime Minister was still arguing for that days before the last European Council in October. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, can tell the House what the figure is that splits the difference between 0 per cent and 5.9 per cent. By my reckoning, it is somewhere  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_854"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 854</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around 2.9 per cent, which is the outcome we actually ended up with. So, after the Government's rhetoric, where have we ended up? We have ended up by splitting the difference.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10122019000069"></a>We welcome the Prime Minister's support for the treaty change agreed at the Council. It is right that the eurozone replaces its ad hoc agreements with a more permanent mechanism. But why does the Prime Minister have to go through such hoops to justify accepting this fairly minor change? He is, after all, showing a sensible piece of what one might call europragmatism. Of course, the problem for the Government is that before the election, the Prime Minister claimed not to be a europragmatist but the great eurosceptic, which is more rhetoric. He promised that if there was any chance for a reopening of the treaty and a referendum on Lisbon, he personally would make it happen. The Foreign Secretary has admitted that the treaty offers a pretext for a referendum, but that it would be absurd to use it to try to derail the whole of Lisbon. Indeed, the Prime Minister also used to say that he would take the first opportunity he needed to repatriate powers over employment and social legislation to Britain, but again, he has not. It would be helpful to the House, and probably more helpful for the noble Lord's own Back-Benchers, to explain why these pre-election commitments have been abandoned.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10122019000070"></a>I turn to the third and most important issue, that of the European economy. The agreement on a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone after 2013 does not address the challenges that Europe's economy faces at the moment. Does the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, agree that eurozone members themselves should do more to promote stability in the eurozone before 2013, and does he also agree that we need European action to promote growth for there to be any chance of serious export growth for the UK? The Prime Minister's plans, with VAT set to rise and spending cuts kicking in, rely on an extra £100 billion of exports over five years, and over 50 per cent of our exports are made to Europe. But the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will be aware that European Commission forecasts show slowing growth within the EU next year. Does he accept that the Government need to do more to work with colleagues in Europe to improve the prospects for growth?</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10122019000071"></a>First, by arguing that all countries engaging in fiscal consolidation, including Germany and the UK, should do so at a pace that supports economic growth both domestically and across Europe as a whole. Secondly, he should ensure that those countries facing problems, including Ireland, are not locked into repeated rounds of austerity with higher taxes and lower spending, hitting the growth those countries need to pay down their debts and recover. Thirdly, he should make sure that Europe's voice in the G20 argues for a growth-oriented strategy. Indeed, I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that given the nature of this Statement, many people will wonder whether the Government see any connection between their own optimistic forecasts for exports and the summit that the Prime Minister attended at the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10122019000072"></a>The Government's approach regarding Europe reflects their wider domestic approach. They think that you can reduce an economic policy to a pure deficit reduction

He made three substantial points and asked questions. I shall try to answer them but, if I am unable to do so, I shall of course right to him in the normal way.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10122019000074"></a>This was an important Council meeting because the issues facing the EU were varied and substantially economic. Some issues were related to the eurozone and the Council took steps to deal with them; and some were related to the budget, which we believed had grown out of control in the past few years.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10122019000075"></a>First, the noble Lord made the point-whether or not he was agreeing with me was hard to tell-that the budget was not the victory it looked because the European Parliament had wanted an increase of 5.9 per cent, or whatever it was. The point is that after the last Council the European Parliament voted for-indeed, demanded-6 per cent. The normal way would have been to split the difference between 3 per cent and 6 per cent and ended up at 4.5 per cent. However, with other countries, we stood firm at 2.9 per cent and were right to do so. In a letter that we have agreed with the major net contributors to the EU, we have set a new standard by which future budgets will be judged. I hope that noble Lords opposite will agree that that is good news.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10122019000076"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord agreed that there is a requirement for a new permanent mechanism-I think that is absolutely right-but he went on to ask why we should go through the hoops. The hoops, incidentally, are to allow Parliament to have a say, not only in the arrangements that we already have in the House under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty but in new primary legislation. That is not going through the hoops but putting the decision where it should lie-in Parliament-and that is why we are doing it. There is no question of a referendum because there is no question of a transfer of power from the British Parliament to the European Union.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10122019000077"></a>On the question of growth, the noble Lord is again right to say that there is a problem; there is a crisis in the eurozone and with the euro. We want the EU to succeed-it is in our vital British interests that it should do so-including countries such as Ireland and others which have found themselves in trouble. We believe that we are on the brink of a substantial, export-led growth but Europe, too, needs a credible growth agenda. As the noble Lord pointed out, the EU's potential growth is forecast to be just 1.7 per cent in 2014.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10122019000078"></a>We believe that each member state needs to carry out its own reforms-that is why the UK Government have launched their own growth review-but there is a strong case for similar determination at the EU level, where Europe 2020 needs to provide a more focused drive towards making progress in areas where there is significant EU value added and can genuinely promote

For example, we should focus throughout Europe on a more efficient and competitive single market, especially on increasing productivity and trade in the services sector; we need a more ambitious and open approach to global trade to allow Europe to benefit from growth elsewhere, particularly in Asia; we need a framework for innovation that enables technological change; and we need smarter regulations that will leave enterprise freer to drive the growth that we need.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10122019000079"></a>No one underestimates the challenges that face this country and the rest of Europe. However, with some of our enlightened European partners, we believe that with this kind of agenda for growth we can get ourselves out of trouble.</p>

One of the successes of the Statement is that it is forward-looking. We all know of the difficult issues that are still with us, two or three years after the financial crisis, in the peripheral countries of the eurozone. It was surprising to hear so much time devoted by the Official Opposition to the past and what the Government might or might not have promised in previous years. Media reports suggest that some concessions were made in terms of the financial perspectives moving forward to the period 2014 to 2020-indeed, the Germans secured their Lisbon treaty revision to establish the financial stability facility-but it was disturbing to hear that there was agreement with the French that the common agricultural policy would remain untouched. In other words, our desire to achieve greater efficiencies will not now bear fruit. Will my noble friend reassure us that we will continue with our commitments to reform the common agricultural policy? I wonder also whether he could reassure us that the newer eurozone countries, which have done very well by the structural funds and would naturally be loath to see them cut back, will nevertheless have conversations with us to attain that end, because we cannot all have cake every day.</p>

Throughout Europe, different countries in different ways are learning the lesson of increasing productivity and trying to do more for less. The Prime Minister had one thing on his mind, and was not alone in so doing. He made it clear that, with leaders having to look at cuts in all sorts of very sensitive areas in their home countries, as we have had to do in ours, it was quite wrong to see net contributions to the EU continue to rise exponentially and that we needed to come forward with a very sensible plan over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10122019000082"></a>My noble friend Lady Falkner asked about our commitment to reform the CAP. This has been a long-standing commitment, and we cling very firmly to our view that the CAP needs to be reformed. Discussions on it will continue, likewise on the structural funds.</p>

In this case, is it not time that, instead of trying to pretend to their anti-European and Eurosceptic Back-Benchers that Britain can stand aside from the problems of the eurozone, the Government recognised that we are in these problems up to our neck, that if we want a credible growth strategy for Britain we must also have a credible growth strategy for the eurozone, and that we should be ready as the United Kingdom in our national interest to play a full part in that?</p>

With the greatest respect to him, I think that his question was misconceived. There is no fear from us that we are trying to appease anti-European or sceptical Back-Benchers. These are bogeymen that obviously exist in the noble Lord's nightmares. We have no such nightmares and no such concerns. If any such concerns exist, they are partly dealt with by explaining that there will be a process in the British Parliament for agreeing the changes that we have made. Of course, as I laid out in the Statement and in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, we have a clear strategy for growth in the United Kingdom and believe that there should be a clear strategy for growth in the rest of Europe.</p>

I was then a bit saddened to hear that it is only treaty changes that do not affect us that get settled in Parliament and ones that do affect us get settled somewhere else. This reflects a very odd view about the primacy of Parliament.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10122019000086"></a>On the budget, on the financial perspectives, I strongly welcome the fact that the Government are taking a tough line in the initial phases of that negotiation. I think that that is absolutely necessary, but they seem to have nailed their colours to something that used to be known in the jargon as "zero real growth" for a period of 10 years. That is a very long time. I do not imagine that the Government will be proposing zero real growth in public expenditure in this country for  10 years and, if they do, their prospects of re-election in 2015 may be a bit damaged. So some care needs to be taken about what is a very long period ahead, although I very much agree that taking a tough line at the beginning is good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10122019000087"></a>Finally, will the noble Lord confirm that the fact that Montenegro was accepted as a candidate country shows that the European Union is continuing with future enlargement in the Balkans and elsewhere?</p>

I liked the noble Lord's characterisation, at the start of his words, about treaty modifications. Of course, what he did not go on to say, when speaking about parliamentary sovereignty, or the primacy of Parliament, is that if there is a substantial transfer of power, we will take it to a referendum of the people of this country. We may disagree about that, but I think that it is a perfectly logical position for us to have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10122019000089"></a>The substance of the noble Lord's point was about zero real growth for 10 years. We have proposed that we should reduce growth up until 2014 and that between 2014 and 2020 there should be no growth, or zero real growth, as the noble Lord pointed out. We cling strongly to this view in part because of the difficulties faced by individual member states within the European Union. There is also a sense that over the last few years some of the spending within the EU has not been as carefully controlled as it might have been. This is an opportunity for the EU to review its own budgeting process and I very much hope that it will be supported by other member states in due course.</p>

The European financial stability mechanism and the European financial stability facility are fully

I seem to remember that two of the conditions were that: first, no Government should run a budget deficit of more than 3 per cent of GDP; and, secondly, that there should be no bailouts? Is not the reason that the European Union-or the eurozone at least-is now having to breach the no-bailout clause is because Governments were allowed to breach the deficit clause? Will that change not create a huge moral hazard? They were getting away with breaking the deficit clause but they did not know that they were going to get bailed out. Now that they know they are going to get bailed out, that is creating a moral hazard that surely will encourage bad behaviour in the future. When my noble friend says that we are in favour of these arrangements, is that because we think that it will make the euro stronger or weaker?</p>

In all the latest opinion polls, a majority of the British people do not want any further powers to be ceded to Europe, and over half of them would like to leave the European Union.</p>

<a name="101220-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10122019000103"></a>Could I ask the noble Lord a question about the eurozone? In one part of the report, the statement is made that it could work only if there was fiscal union as well- saying that it did not want to tell the European Union this, but going on to do so anyway. Is the noble Lord aware that any reform with regard to the larger powers involves fiscal union? That is what France, Germany and, indeed, Italy want. Can I have the assurance that this would be opposed by the British Government and, perhaps, even by the British people through a referendum?</p>

The noble Lord says that we have been accused of kowtowing too much to Europhiles. We have certainly been accused of kowtowing to Eurosceptics. The main point of this, which the noble Lord has understood very well, is that we have said clearly that if there is to be a transfer of power from this Parliament to the European Union, it should be subject to a referendum. We hear what people are saying in various polls about their view that too much power has been ceded, that they are not consulted enough and it is all being done the wrong way. We will make this a matter of statute when later in this Session we get to the European Bill, which I hope the noble Lord and other noble Lords will support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10122019000105"></a>The countries of the eurozone need to sort out their own problems. No doubt some of us will have different views as to how that should be done but, if there was a move down the road towards a European-wide fiscal solution for European-wide economic problems, we would oppose it.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="10122019000115"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10122019000524"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Neville-Jones):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House I would like to repeat a Statement made earlier today in another place by my friend the Minister of State for Immigration. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10122019000116"></a>"In June, when the Government announced that they would consult on how to implement a permanent limit on economic migrants, we also said that we would impose an interim limit, until the permanent one took effect. This was to avoid a surge of applications in anticipation of the permanent limit.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10122019000117"></a>The interim limit was given effect through changes to the Immigration Rules which were laid before Parliament and on which an oral Statement was made. On Friday, we received the judgment that the changes announced provide insufficient legal basis for the operation of the interim limit.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10122019000118"></a>The judgment was based on a technical procedural point, known as Pankina grounds. The court decided that this meant more detail about the manner in which  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_862"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 862</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the limit is set, including its level, should have been included in the Immigration Rules changes laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10122019000119"></a>I would like to make it clear that the judgment of the court was concerned solely with the technicalities of how the interim limits were introduced. It was in no way critical of, or prejudicial to, the Government's policy of applying a limit to economic migration to the United Kingdom, either permanently or on an interim basis.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10122019000120"></a>The policy objective of a limit in migration has not been called into question and I am now considering what steps are required to reapply an interim limit consistent with the findings of the court.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10122019000121"></a>Tomorrow I will be laying changes to the Immigration Rules which will set out the details the court required. This will enable us to reinstate the interim limits on a clear legal basis. The House will be interested to know that I will also be laying changes to the rules tomorrow to close applications under the tier 1 general route from outside the United Kingdom, as the original level specified on this tier has been reached. I can reassure the House that the policy of using these limits as part of our overall policy of reducing net migration is unchanged. I commend this Statement to the House".</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10122019000122"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="10122019000123"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10122019000525"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for repeating the urgent question in the other place as a Statement.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10122019000124"></a>Migration has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to our country, but it is also essential that it is properly controlled for reasons of both economic well-being and social cohesion. Over the past few years, the previous Government put in transitional controls on EU migration; a suspension of unskilled work permits; a tough but flexible points system to manage skilled migration; tighter regulation of overseas students, leading to the closure of 140 bogus colleges; and new citizenship requirements for those seeking settlement.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10122019000125"></a>At the general election, the leader of the Conservative Party proposed to go further in two key respects. First, he proposed a new target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands by 2015. To meet that target he pledged a cap on immigration, which he said would be tougher than the points system. Since then, the Government have been in wholesale retreat.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10122019000126"></a>The Home Affairs Committee and the Migration Advisory Committee have highlighted that the cap not only excludes EU migration but covers only 20 per cent of non-EU migration. The CBI, Chambers of Commerce, universities, UK and foreign companies have highlighted the damage the Government's proposals would have meant for business investment and job creation.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10122019000127"></a>As a result, we have the retreat confirmed by the Home Secretary on 23 November. We have also learnt of the funding cuts in the noble Baroness's department, leading to the cutting of the number of border officers and staff by nearly a quarter, raising serious questions about the security of our borders and whether the Government's policy can actually be implemented.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_863"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 863</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10122019000128"></a>We come to the way in which the Home Secretary imposed the cap. On 28 June, the Home Secretary came to the other place to announce, without consultation, an immediate and temporary cap on non-EU migration. Details of this cap were then posted on the Home Office website, but not presented to Parliament. On Friday, the High Court ruled that the actions of the Home Secretary were in fact illegal. Lord Justice Sullivan said,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10122019000418"></a>"There can be no doubt that she"-</p>

<p><a name="10122019000405"></a>the Home Secretary-</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000432"></a>"was attempting to sidestep provisions for Parliamentary scrutiny ... and her attempt was for that reason unlawful".</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000129"></a>As a result, the Government's much heralded cap does not in fact exist. As Lord Justice Sullivan said,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000433"></a>"no interim limits were lawfully published ... by the Secretary of State ... there is not, and never has been, a limit on the number of applicants who may be admitted".</ul>
<a name="101220-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10122019000130"></a>In the light of this chaotic situation, on the consequences of the error, what is the status of those who applied under the illegal cap but were rejected? Will their applications now be granted? Can the Minister tell the House how many more migrants she now expects to enter the UK, while the cap is out of action? And in this light, is it still the target of this Government to cut net migration to tens of thousands by 2015, as the Prime Minister pledged before the election? Or is this mistake one reason why the Home Secretary is now trying to water down this target to just an aim?</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10122019000131"></a>Secondly, how did we get into this mess in the first place? Did Ministers ask for and receive legal advice before the summer about the legality of the temporary cap and the rushed way they were introducing it? Can she confirm that, in fact, Ministers were warned by officials and lawyers that there was a real risk of legal challenge if Parliament were bypassed in this way? Will the Minister agree to lay before Parliament all the legal advice on which the decision to proceed was based in order to dispel the impression that they have acted in a reckless and chaotic manner and to show that Home Office Ministers have nothing to hide in this regard?</p>

<a name="10122019000132"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10122019000526"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> I am extremely glad to hear that noble Lords opposite can agree that migration into this country needs to be controlled. The problem is that it is insufficiently controlled. The Government remain attached to their target of controlling migration down to levels of the tens of thousands that we had at the beginning of this century.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10122019000133"></a>It is not clear to me how the noble Lord gets the idea that the Government are in "wholesale retreat". Let me give him an example of the way in which the Government are most certainly not in wholesale retreat. In the Statement, it was announced that we were closing the applications for the limit on tier 1 general. This is because the limit of 5,100 has already been reached. Had we gone on at the same rate, we would have had a higher level of migration under that tier; it would probably be roughly double what it was last year. We do not consider that an acceptable rate of migration, and we have therefore closed that category. So it is not at all clear to me that we are in "wholesale retreat".</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10122019000134"></a>Of course, we have yet to see the statement and the judgment in writing. It would be unwise of me to go too far until we have seen that. What seems to be clear is that the court was critical of the decision to put the cap limit into the guidance, rather than into the rules. I am not aware that there are further problems. Did the Home Office take legal advice on the matter? Yes, it did. Are the Government going to publish that legal advice? No, the previous Government did not do so, and we are not going to do so either.</p>

My first is as the chairman of the Institute of Cancer Research. I made a speech in your Lordships' House some weeks ago expressing my severe misgivings about aspects of the Government's policy, in which I said that that policy, as it stands at present, is preventing eminent international scientific researchers from entering this country. That is clearly an unintended consequence-yet another example of some of the unintended consequences that have streamed from Whitehall during the past few weeks.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10122019000136"></a>My second declaration of interest is as a former business manager in the other House and as a member of the Legislation Committee for seven years. The notion that this is a technical oversight is not true; it is a kindergarten error. I cannot recall in my time on the Legislation Committee, or as a business manager in the other place, anyone overlooking the parliamentary procedure to which my noble friend refers.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10122019000137"></a>Some weeks ago I had a meeting with the Minister of State at the Home Office, in which I set out my views on the unintended consequences of his actions, and he promised to write to me. I have still not heard back from him-perhaps this is an intended consequence of our meeting. Will my noble friend please assure me that in future these errors will not be committed by the Home Office and will she give me further reassurance that she will have a word with Ministers in the Home Office to ensure that between now and April, when these matters come into permanent effect, they will look seriously at the misgivings that some of us have expressed about their policy over the past few weeks?</p>

<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="10122019000138"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10122019000528"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> My Lords, I say two things to my noble friend. First, he said that this was a kindergarten error, but we actually took legal advice. On his second, more substantive point, perhaps he missed my honourable friend the Immigration Minister's announcement that, when the permanent scheme comes into effect, it will not necessarily be precisely the same as the interim structure. We are consulting on that structure and listening to what people have said. One of the changes that have already been announced is that we will create a category for international talent-people whom this country badly needs. I hope that my noble friend's anxieties on that score are somewhat alleviated by the Government's willingness to listen to the points that are being made to us.</p>

That being the case-and she has told the House that changes to the rules will be laid tomorrow to enable the Government to reinstate the interim limits on a clear basis-will she explain what the procedure will be and what consultation of Parliament there will be?</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10122019000140"></a>I would like to try to find a positive in this. During the period in which the cap has applied, whether properly or not, have the Government been able to take any comments or details from employers or indeed employees from particular sectors that will feed into decisions about the permanent limits? When the Minister gave evidence to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee earlier this year, she said that the Government would keep the interim limits under constant review to assess whether they were meeting the objectives outlined and, indeed, that they would monitor any unintended consequences.</p>

I might say that that was not done with any intention to obviate our obligations to the legislature; this was laid out before Parliament in good faith. We felt that one of the ways in which it would be helpful to have greater flexibility when putting in the interim arrangements was to have the figure in the guidance so that it would be easy, in the light of the kind of consultation that we wished to conduct, to carry numbers over from one month to the next. I have to say that, in putting the figures into the rules, as no doubt we will now do, there will be greater rigidity in the arrangements that have to be arrived at.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10122019000142"></a>The noble Baroness asked two other questions. One was whether we would consult on the changes to the new rules. Our obligation in this instance is to get ourselves into conformity with the judgment and I hope therefore that there will be no argument about what we do. She also asked whether we had listened to employers from particular sectors. The answer is that we have been consulting extremely widely and in all sectors.</p>

Then, when we see the judgment in writing, if we need to make further changes in the light of that, we will certainly do so. It is not clear to me how much clearer I can be on the question of the nature of the rigidity introduced by the cap. There is complex drafting involved in putting a limit in the rules to give us the ability then to change it, which is why the Government decided, in order to retain flexibility, that we would keep the limit in the guidance.</p>

Does she therefore understand my disappointment that she has apparently decided that the coalition agreement pledge to "reintroduce exit checks" cannot be fulfilled until 2015, which is later than the former Labour Government planned to introduce this change? Given that her Written Answers to me reveal that only some 5 per cent of those departing the UK are currently subject to exit controls, and that there is complacency at the Home Office on the need for urgent action, will she hold urgent discussions with our right honourable friend the Home Secretary, to whom she is responsible for national security, with a view to getting something done?</p>

Most of the people coming in, except for a very small number, are sponsored to this country, so it will not be difficult to know when they are moving-their employers will not be able to have a new person in, in the absence of being able  to demonstrate that those who previously had that sponsorship have left.</p>

May I ask the Minister about something that is still not clear? She mentioned that a Statement would be made tomorrow. Are we expecting a Statement or are we expecting changes in the rules for the interim cap?

Perhaps I should take this opportunity to say that the rules will then change immediately-that is to say, the rule change will be commenced immediately to rectify tier 2. Also, as was contained in the Statement, the Government will be closing tier 1 on 23 December.

As I said, very few of those who come here to work come without any kind of sponsorship. There is a small category of entrepreneurs and investors who are in that position. Otherwise, people who come here to work have sponsors. Sponsors are not able to replace them. There cannot be a net increase in the migration to this country in the absence of the person who sponsored the employment giving notification of the departure of the employee and the reinstatement of a new person, if they wish it.

The present cap, however, applies only to non-EU countries-presumably that includes Australia, Canada and New Zealand. There is also increasing concern at the number of immigrants coming from within the European Union, which will increasingly become a political problem in the United Kingdom.

She would find, as I have found, that a large number of the applications would come from people who have student visas-I am glad to see the noble and learned Baroness over there, because she has had experience of getting caught on this, as I very nearly did-and that many of them, when one replies and asks for their immigration status, disappear very smartly. There are masses of people coming into this country seeking work illegally, so does the Minister not agree that the suggestion of my noble friend of having exit checks would be one way of finding out whether those who are admitted, for example as students, ever leave the country at all? Also, surely she agrees that it would be extremely foolish for the Government to set the precedent of publishing, as has been requested, the legal advice given to Ministers in confidence. That would not be the way of ensuring that Ministers receive blunt, honest and open legal advice in future.</p>

The object of the exercise is undoubtedly to ensure that those who get the right to work here are legally here under the qualifications that we are setting. He is also right to say that a number of people apply under categories of so-called skilled labour when they are clearly unskilled. That is a practice that we also intend to bring to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10122019000158"></a>Lastly, on the point of external immigration checks, the Government are aware of the concern on this issue and they are, indeed, going to bring in these exit checks. There are problems related to the contract which the previous Government negotiated and which we have had to end. That means that we have to find other ways of bringing in that exit check, but we will do so as early as we are able to. I have given my noble friend who asked the question earlier an estimate of when we are going to be able to do this. If we could do it earlier, we certainly would.</p>

I know we have a lot of work to do and that the House is eager to do it. With this amendment, to which my noble friend Lord Bach and my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer have appended their names and added a complementary amendment, we come to the political heart of the Bill. This is the buckle that ties together the two bits of the Bill-the AV referendum on the one hand and the reduction of MPs and redrawing of constituency boundaries on the other. The first bit is the fervent wish of the Lib Dem partners in the coalition; the second is the fervent wish of the Conservative partners in the coalition.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10122019000169"></a>Before I explain why I believe that to be misguided, I will get my retaliation in first to an intervention that I would otherwise expect. My objection is not to both measures being in one Bill. I know that there is a case to be made that the Government I supported included many more than two measures in their Constitutional Reform and Governance Act before the general election. It is interesting to speculate about what the full purpose of that Bill was since it clearly could not pass before the general election. Partly, no doubt, we felt that the wise British people would be very appreciative of all the proposals that we were putting forward, but we were particularly interested in the reaction of the Liberal Democrats. We realised that we might have to form some kind of agreement with them after a general  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_870"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 870</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>election and we wanted to show that we shared their views. After a few months of observing the Lib Dems in government, I think we were totally wrong about what their views were. We thought they were constitutional and economic liberals; it turns out that they are constitutional conservatives and economic reactionaries.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10122019000170"></a>I will pass swiftly on. What I object to is not that the two measures appear in one Bill but that they are conditional. They enter the concept of conditionality into our legislation. You can only do the one if you do the other, too. This seems wholly wrong. Either these two proposals-the AV referendum and the constituency redrawing-are justified on their individual merits or they are not. There can be no case whatever for saying, "We'll only do one if we do the other", in logic or constitutional parlance, although we understand the political realities of this. It says a lot about the nature of the coalition and, in particular, the atmosphere in which it was formed. This stuff is here because the two coalition partners, when they were negotiating their agreement, did not trust each other. They could see that there was a grubby deal to be made.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10122019000171"></a>The Lib Dems could make some headway on electoral reform. They did not want AV and there was a system they liked more but they understood the realities. The Tories were trying to change the number of constituencies and their boundaries so that they won more seats at the next general election. The deal that was made between them was that they would do both. Because one proposition was likely to lead to fewer Conservative seats and one to more Conservative seats, they decided to bung them together-all that I understand. What is sad, and does not increase one's confidence in the long-term viability of the coalition, is that the parties so distrusted each other that they wanted it incorporated into legislation in the subsection before the House at the moment.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10122019000172"></a>This is a more political speech than I would like to make in Committee but this is a political clause. We have to understand it. Some bits of the Bill are technical. We will come to those and deal with them in a technical way but this is a political clause. My next observation about this provision is that it says a lot about the balance of power within the coalition. The Lib Dems did not say, "Our condition for giving you the boundary changes that suit you is that we get the electoral system that suits us". They feebly said, "Our condition for your getting the boundary changes you want is that we get not AV but a go at AV through a referendum". However, if the referendum is lost, which, as a strong supporter of AV, I hope it will not be, the Conservatives can still have their boundary changes and reduce the number of MPs.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10122019000173"></a>We will come to the substance of the case about the number of MPs later in our debates. Suffice it to say that no case of merit has yet been put forward for reducing the size of the House of Commons. It may be that there is such a case to be made-I look forward to Ministers developing it-but we have not heard a word about it yet. So far we have just heard the Government admit that they got a figure straight out of the air and incorporated it into a Bill. We have seen no case made-not for greater constituency equalisation, which I would grant-for the figure of 5 per cent  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_871"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 871</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>included in the Bill, which, as we shall see when we get to it, is not a sensible figure for the variance in the size of constituencies. Nor has the case been made that the exemptions in the Bill get anywhere near meeting the very strong case that can be made for further exemptions.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10122019000174"></a>The suspicion must be that the measures in Part 2 of the Bill are entirely designed for the sole purpose of increasing the number of Conservative seats at the next general election. If the Government can produce a statistical analysis from a reputable team of psephologists that says that it will not have that effect, the House will be delighted to see and discuss it. However, I say with no little confidence that they will not be able to do that because the effects are as I have described them.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10122019000175"></a>I do not want to detain the House for too long on this but my third point is about how much the Government must regret the need to link these two measures. How sorry they must be. In any sensible world, if it is true that the coalition wants the referendum to take place on 5 May 2011, it would have introduced two separate pieces of legislation. There would have been one on the alternative vote, which might well have concluded its stage in your Lordships' House if not tonight then in the first session in the new year, after the good examination that we have given it. The Government could then go ahead with the AV referendum. They could then take a more measured approach to the constituencies bit of the Bill. They could even have allowed it to be subject to some measure of joint scrutiny, without prejudicing their timetable to get it into effect by the next election. They could have allowed, as we propose later in the Bill, that there should be some conference-a royal commission or Speaker's Conference-on the number of MPs to take a rational view as to what should happen. That consideration could have moved in parallel to your Lordships' House considering the AV bit of the Bill.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10122019000176"></a>Where are we? Your Lordships have an awful lot of the Bill to consider as yet. We are to do so against the looming timetable; the Electoral Commission has made clear when it requires the Bill to be passed to allow the campaign for 5 May to occur on an orderly path. We are struggling to meet this wholly artificial timetable, imposed by the Government solely because of the political deal that they have done and the fact that neither party trusts the other to abide by its words.</p>

It was overlooked in debates in the other place, which perhaps makes it all the more important that we debate it properly in this House and in this Committee.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10122019000183"></a>Clause 8 informs the Minister what to do following the result of the referendum being announced. If more votes in the referendum are cast in favour of the answer yes than in favour of the answer no, the Minister must make an order that brings into force provisions to change our voting system for elections to the House of Commons from first past the post to this type of alternative vote system. However, that is not the end of it. An affirmative result in the referendum is not sufficient according to the Bill. The changes in the boundaries detailed in Part 2 of the Bill, particularly in Clause 10, must also have taken place before the alternative vote system can take effect.</p>

I wondered what it is that joins them at the hip on this Bill. I now believe it sincerely to be Clause 8(1)(b) that joins them thus. It has been clear from the introduction of this Bill that this clause is the glue that holds the Government together. Part 1 of the Bill, as was said at Second Reading, is clearly and plainly the Liberal Democrat part of the deal. However AV may have been described by their leader in the past, the Liberal Democrats have decided that it is worth the candle and that it is best not to go searching for some sort of proportional representation, or certainly not at the moment.</p>

It redraws every constituency boundary according to a rigid mathematical formula, and that is the Conservative part of the deal. The

This Bill is their fight back; their chance to get their own back. Of course biases exist, but electoral geography is merely an element of this. As has been debated in Committee and at Second Reading, other factors such as the efficiency of the distribution of parties' votes, are, we would argue, much more significant. However, I do not think the Conservative part of the Government, or the Government as a whole, believe that-or will not acknowledge it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10122019000186"></a>This Bill is the coalition agreement in miniature. It is vital for both sides to get their parts of the bargain. I assume that is why noble Lords on the government Benches, those who represent both parties that make up the coalition and whom one might have expected to speak out more on various elements of the Bill, have been so-I was going to say well behaved but perhaps quiet is the better word. As the high point of the coalition agreement, this Bill, and specifically Clause 8(1)(b) and Clause 8(3), accurately demonstrates the inequity, mentioned by my noble friend mentioned a moment ago, of the deal bartered out over those famous five days in May, about which so many books have already been written-and how many more can we expect? As it stands, even if 99 per cent of the population were to vote in favour of changing the Westminster voting system to this version of AV, this change could not come about until the Secretary of State had laid before Parliament the reports of the boundary commissions and a draft Order in Council giving effect to the recommendations contained in the reports of the boundary commissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10122019000187"></a>We know, or we will soon find out, that Part 2 of this Bill is controversial in itself, as was clear in the debates in the other place and from the lobbying that we have all received all the way from academia to the Keep Cornwall Whole campaign. The intended rules to redraw the constituency boundaries are unpopular, not least because they subjugate the sensible and logical needs to acknowledge community ties and geography when formulating constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10122019000188"></a>It is not beyond possibility that the boundary changes detailed in Clause 10 are delayed or altered in some way. What then for the alternative vote? What then if, for example, a large majority has voted for AV? Is that result of that referendum simply to be ignored? As the Bill stands, it seems to say yes to that question. Why did the Minister's party accept this? Why did it not insist at the very least in writing a reverse bind into the Bill? We support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Lipsey.</p>

It was a Labour decision to stop that. They now come to the House and argue that both things are unacceptable. Surely being fair is a Conservative concept.

It happens to be a Conservative principle with which I disagree. I do not believe in referenda and I never have believed in them.

Could it possibly be that they are seeking with some real difficulty to find reasons why they should spend as much time as possible discussing these matters? I do not want to help them in that, so I will finish by saying one simple thing. I came to this House expecting and finding that there was, in many cases, a degree of quality in debate unfound in my 35 years in the House of Commons. I am very sad to find that during these recent Bills, those who have experience of the House of Commons and those who have been press-ganged into the little battle have used all the techniques which brought and bring the other House into such disrepute. I am very sorry that yet again on this Bill we have lowered ourselves to doing the kinds of things which are done elsewhere. It is a pity that we cannot look back on our traditions, even for someone as newly hatched as myself, and raise the standards again.</p>

He says that it was the Labour Government who changed the rules to make it not possible for more rural seats to have a smaller electorate. I should be grateful if he could give us chapter and verse on that. As I understand them, the rules we work under now were passed under a Conservative Government in 1986 of which I think he was almost certainly a distinguished and leading member. We actually believe that those rules are well worth preserving.</p>

I simply say to him that if he is worried about traditions-and he ought to be worried about them-one of the traditions he should remember is that it is particularly important that you do not drive through major constitutional changes without a large measure of agreement between the parties. One of those changes relates to the size of the House of Commons. As the noble Lord will know, if you act as an international observer at elections overseas, one thing that you note is who decides the size of the Parliament and how they decide it. If the Government decide it without the consent of opposition parties, you usually mark the election down. However, that is another matter that we shall pursue at a later stage. The Minister will recognise the filibuster by the noble Lord, Lord Deben, who has long experience of doing that. From my experience in the House of Commons, he was one of the people who got a reputation for filibustering there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10122019000204"></a>I have a particular question for the Minister raised by this amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Lipsey. It came to my mind when my noble friend Lord Bach was speaking. My noble friend mentioned the important issue of the commission having to report first. The Minister will know that there is an agreement whereby Orkney and Shetland and, I believe, the Western Isles have already been accorded special status. He will also know that there is very strong pressure from the Member for the Isle of Wight-a Conservative Member-and all the major political parties representing the councils on the Isle of Wight to be treated in the same way as the Western Isles and Orkney and Shetland. He will also be aware that there is a major campaign in Cornwall for Cornwall to be treated in a way that recognises its historic-and, I should add, traditional, to keep the noble Lord, Lord Deben, happy-boundaries. My question to the Minister is this: if there is a legal challenge based on the fact that Cornwall and the Isle of Wight have not been accorded the same conditions  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_877"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 877</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as the Western Isles and Orkney and Shetland, could these changes go ahead? I know that people are talking of a legal challenge, so it is an important issue. I do not know whether such a challenge would be possible. It occurred to me when my noble friend Lord Bach was speaking so I have not been able to take advice on it. However, given the reasons that we have already heard as to why the two Scottish areas have been given special circumstances, it would seem at least possible for the Isle of Wight, certainly, and possibly Cornwall, where it would be a bit more difficult, to mount a legal challenge. I should like the Minister to address that in his reply.</p>

If the Isle of Wight were to issue a challenge, I do not know whether the representatives of Ynys Môn would do the same. Clearly, if there were such a challenge, it would be likely to be at least prima facie justiciable. It would therefore very likely take some time and the Government's timetable would be knocked sideways.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10122019000206"></a>My main point during this brief intervention is that I am perhaps the last person to lecture the opposition Front Bench and the noble Lord, Lord Deben, on the principles of Conservatism. However, I should have thought that one of those principles would be a respect for the constitution-a broadening down from precedent to precedent. The great Conservative thinkers, be they Burke, Hailsham or Oakeshott at the LSE, have all adhered to an enormous respect for the accumulated wisdom of the ages and have therefore had a certain unwillingness to go full steam ahead in changing structures for their own sake. The point has been well made by my noble friends Lord Foulkes and Lord Howarth that this seems to be an enormous bundle of changes, many of them ill thought-through and ill digested.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10122019000207"></a>Finally, another Conservative principle which, again, perhaps is not honoured on this occasion is respect for the wisdom of Parliament. One conclusion that I have reached in listening to this debate is that there seems to be no willingness on the part of the government Front Bench to listen and to modify their position in the light of arguments that have been adduced. I do not think that I have ever come across a case where the juggernaut of the coalition has moved at such a pace, is so deaf to the quality of the arguments that have been raised and is unwilling to make any concession at all. I say with all humility that I cannot see the coalition Government gaining from this if they act in a traditionally non-Conservative spirit which wholly ignores the quality of the contributions not only from this side but in excellent speeches from the Cross Benches. They may well live to regret the attitude that they have taken to this Bill, and I hope it is not a precedent for other Bills that come before this Parliament.</p>

I specifically put on the record a refutation of the view put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Deben. I remember very clearly the noble Lord when he and I were Members in another place. My summary of the situation was that, when the Conservative Opposition wished to delay or prolong debate, he seemed to be wheeled on to speak at great length.

One evening last week, I spoke on this very important Bill for two periods of about two minutes each and then for a third time for about five or six minutes, making 10 minutes in total, so I do not think that I can be accused of filibustering and so on. I was involved as much as anybody and the only House of Commons attitude that I see in this House is a capacity of Governments of both kinds, Labour and Conservative-because it is an elected House and that is fair enough-to ram Bills through with strict timetables and so on. Here, the Government are trying to ram through an important constitutional change without any regard to the views that are put forward, and they are getting very annoyed because people want to make and answer points. If they do not answer them, they will be on record as never having answered. I genuinely do not believe that there is any filibustering going on here. If the noble Lord had been here more often, he would have heard the wide range of different views on this side of the Chamber on these very matters. Therefore, he should be a bit fairer about this.</p>

I am on record in several places as saying-and I repeat it, although I know that it annoys people down the other end when I say it-that I was under greater scrutiny in my eight years here as a Minister than I ever was in the other place. I am quite happy to say that. It was because of the nature of the way this place works, whether Question Time, Select Committees, or the Floor of the House. There is no doubt about it. I speak only from my own experience. It takes a while to get used to this place, and it can be irritating.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10122019000214"></a>My other two brief points are these. I have been here on this Bill virtually every day, missing only a couple of hours one day, because I just happen to be interested. I do not agree with everything that is happening, as I will make clear in a moment. I have taken several Bills through this House, and in no Committee stage in which I was involved was I aware of ever being forced to say, or of agreeing to say, to the House, "I will take it away and think about it"; or of saying, "I will take that part of this argument away, think about it, and then promise to come back on Report". If you cannot make a change of rule, you come back openly, having looked at it in the department. Not once, as far as I know, in these debates in six days has any Minister ever said, "A good idea, or maybe a good idea, and we will take that away. There might be something we can do.

There is nothing between us. If you are going to have one person one vote in a constituency-based system, you have to have the constituencies as near as damn it the same size. This was argued out years ago in the 1970s. I can remember there was an argument at a boundary inquiry. I even remember the late Denis Howell lecturing to us and saying, "Look, we might argue for smaller seats in the inner areas because our workload is greater, there is deprivation and there are all the other issues. On the other hand, you have to balance that against the massive distances that country members have to travel. It is different". What is important is the number people who are voting for one parliament.</p>

For that reason-it is also why I have no amendments to table to the second half of the Bill-I do not think there should be more than 500 Members of the other place.

However, on this occasion I will try and resist temptation because it might take us down further highways and byways. I pause to observe that it might be difficult to do so because while on the one hand some noble Lords from the Labour Benches have indicated that the coalition agreement was to the disadvantage of the Liberal Democrats, on the other hand the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, indicated that was a threat to the Conservative Party and its view of constitutional reform.</p>

He was, of course, a member of a Government-and I pay huge tribute to them-who by this equivalent stage in their first term had had a referendum on their programme for devolution for Scotland and Wales, and then introduced legislation on freedom of information and some reform to this House, and passed the Human Rights Act which put forward proportional representation for the European elections. I just regret that they ran out of steam when it came to implementing their election manifesto promise on a referendum on the electoral system, or we might have been able to avoid some of these discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10122019000225"></a>It is important that we address the amendment which the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, proposed some time ago and which was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Bach. As the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, indicated, this was part of the coalition agreement, and it is worth recalling that back in those days in May this year, it was very clear that no party had won the election. Indeed, given the instability in world markets at the time and the potential political instability which could be fed by that, my own party, the Liberal Democrats, came to an agreement with the Conservative Party to form a coalition Government to bring, I believe, much needed stability at a very crucial time.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10122019000226"></a>There were several issues in that agreement with regard to constitutional reform and the coalition's programme for government made a clear commitment to both the issues involved in this Bill-a referendum on the alternative vote and a boundary review to ensure a reduction of the House of Commons and equality of value of votes in constituencies. It was the Government's view that both issues should be tackled and implemented together, and we have never made any secret of that particular fact.</p>

Indeed, together with other elements, it formed part of the basis for the coalition agreement. Speculating about other voting systems does not take us much further.

He made the point that if there is a no vote in the referendum, the boundary proposals still go through. If there was a no vote-as I hope not, and our parties in the collation are agreed about what the outcome of the referendum should be-as a Liberal Democrat, I do not think I could ignore the view of the people.

Indeed, as my noble friend Lord McNally has said on a number of occasions, this Bill is about fair votes and fair boundaries. It shows that the two are, in fact, linked.

Given that the Bill says that a constituency does not have to comply if it covers an area of more than 12,000 square kilometres, can the noble Lord, in advance of the debate at a future time, place a letter in the Library of the House of Lords detailing the criteria on which these decisions were made so that we can be better informed when it comes to that debate?</p>

His having been a member of that Government, I am sure that the noble Lord will be well aware of those criteria. However, I have no doubt that we will come back to this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10122019000257"></a>I shall conclude where we came in by indicating that Amendments 45 and 46A would separate the two issues. The first amendment moved by the noble Lord would do this by removing the stipulation that the alternative vote provisions are brought in only after the draft Order in Council is laid, and the second amendment would do this by removing the provision that requires the alternative vote provisions to be brought into force on the same day. It does not actually break the linkage as it would leave the requirement that the order bringing the boundaries provisions into force must have been laid first, although that would not necessarily be on the same day. It may be  the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Bach, to put the amendments together.</p>

As my noble friend Lord McNally has said on many occasions, the linkage is fair votes and fair boundaries. The Government are committed to both provisions if a yes vote is carried in the referendum. The Government therefore wish to see both provisions, if the yes vote is carried, to come into effect in time for the next general election. On that basis, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I agree that the Boundary Commission can be judicially reviewed and I accept that the House decided that this is not a hybrid Bill. What I am interested in is that when I asked him about the Isle of Wight, on which I will focus in relation to the amendment that we are discussing, a challenge under this current amendment would prevent the system going forward in the way the Bill envisages; so the question whether there can be a legal challenge is crucial.</p>

I know the area of the Western Isles rather well, but I do not know Orkney and Shetland. However, I do know that those two areas have similar problems to the problem faced by the constituency of the Member for the Isle of Wight, who has argued the case very strongly in the House of Commons. If there is a similar problem, there are the conditions for a possible legal challenge. Indeed, I think the Minister used the phrase "it is common sense" when he said that the two Scottish

I am a great believer in common sense, but I have to say that it can get you into deep trouble when you go into a court of law.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10122019000262"></a>This goes back to a point made by my noble friend Lord Rooker that there is a case for the Government to be more willing to compromise on this Bill and at least to offer to investigate. I would very much like to know, and I am sure that councillors on the Isle of Wight would love to know, the government law officers' view on whether a legal challenge could be mounted because there was no Boundary Commission review of the Isle of Wight. It seems at least possible, so it would be good if we could have the lawyers' views  on this.</p>

Indeed, you do not even disclose whether advice has been given. However, I will reflect on what the noble Lord, Lord Soley, has said and not necessarily answer his question about advice but perhaps revisit the advice that was given to the House by the Clerks when the particular issue of hybridity was looked at.</p>

How can he seek to justify that?</p>

There will be time to debate the fixed-term Parliament Bill, but the assumption is that the next general election will be held on the first Thursday in May 2015. Therefore there will be ample time for both orders to be laid and implemented together, assuming of course that there is a yes vote. If it is a no vote, no time is attached to bringing forward an order to repeal the relevant sections of the Bill, or the Act as it will be by then.</p>

He said rather wryly that it seemed to have been a long time since I stood up to move the amendments in my name. I did not manage to speak for as long as he did. I do not think that I spoke for more than 10 minutes, and I was trying to make a substantive case, on which we have had a good debate.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10122019000270"></a>However, I think that the debate was thrown off course at one point by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, whom we all greatly admire. The noble Lord made a partisan attack on ex-Members of the House of Commons on this side of the Committee in a speech made by an ex-Member of the other House. I do not think that we progress best in this House by swapping partisan insults of that kind. Perhaps this should be a warning to us to keep them to a minimum. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Deben, I was never a Member of the House of Commons and so I have not adapted to the kind of things that I understand from this debate go on there.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10122019000271"></a>It is important to get away from the partisan, and I do so, as part of my concluding remarks, by referring to the non-partisan committee of this House- the Constitution Committee-which examined the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill and had many prominent Conservatives in its ranks, including the noble Lords, Lord Norton, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Renton of Mount Harry. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10122019000424"></a>"In general, we regard it as a matter of principle that proposals for major constitutional reform should be subject to prior public consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny. We recognise that there may exceptionally be good reasons for departing from this principle, but the perils of doing so are well illustrated in the present Bill. The case for proceeding rapidly with one Part of this Bill is far stronger than for the other".</p>

<p><a name="10122019000409"></a>In other words, the non-partisan examination of the buckle in the Bill said that it should not be there. However, it is there-the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, was commendably frank about this-and it is there for purely political reasons. Therefore it is right that we in this House, with our responsibilities to the constitution as a whole, should examine whether those reasons are convincing.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10122019000272"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, was a little less convincing when he tried to explain the reasons for it being there when he said, "Of course, if the AV referendum is lost I would not want to push ahead with it". With great respect, that is not the point that we on this side of the House are seeking to make. Our point is different: it is that the two sets of proposals are not treated the same. Of course, if the AV referendum is lost, noble Lords should not proceed with an AV proposal, but there is no such conditionality on the proposals for constituency and boundary changes-they are to go ahead nevertheless.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10122019000273"></a>Before the House has even started to examine these proposals-and before the Boundary Commission has started on the extremely onerous, some people believe impracticable, task it is being set-the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, says that the boundary changes and the change in the number of MPs will go ahead. If they do not go ahead-and all kinds of happenstance could prevent them from going ahead-neither will

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10122019000274"></a>I do not propose to force this issue to a Division today.

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10122019000276"></a>"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to make a Statement on the continuing severe weather. We are facing exceptional conditions. It looks set to be the coldest December since 1910, with average temperatures four to five degrees below the norm for December. Many areas have had record low temperatures and snowfall has been the most widespread since 1981. The forecast is for continued severe cold and further snowfall through the coming week and over Christmas and the new year.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10122019000277"></a>Transport services have suffered extensive disruption in the last few days and there is a likelihood of further disruption through this week. I recognise that this is particularly stressful just a few days ahead of the Christmas break and I understand the frustration of those who are trying to get away or, indeed, are trying to get home.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10122019000278"></a>Transport services were also disrupted in the first spell of winter weather that came unusually early at the end of November. That period tested the systems which, in some cases, had performed so poorly earlier this year. The then Government asked David Quarmby, chairman of the RAC Foundation and a former chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, to conduct a review of winter resilience. His initial report was issued in July and a final report was published in October. It made 28 recommendations, some of them directed at central government, some at local government and some at transport operators. Many of those recommendations have already been implemented, although some will necessarily take longer.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10122019000279"></a>On 2 December, I asked David Quarmby, in the light of the weather conditions we were then experiencing, to conduct an audit of the implementation of his recommendations and to make any further observations  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_890"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 890</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he felt necessary. This is an independent report and I understand that David Quarmby intends to publish it tomorrow.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10122019000280"></a>One of the principal recommendations of the first Quarmby report concerned salt: levels of stocks that local authorities should hold, dosage rates for optimum use of stocks and the acquisition of a strategic stockpile by central government. Local authorities went into this period with significantly better salt stocks than last winter and the Highways Agency, on the Government's behalf, had purchased 300,000 tonnes of salt to form a strategic stockpile, of which over 150,000 tonnes is already at UK ports with the remainder scheduled for delivery through December and early January.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10122019000281"></a>Over the last few days, highway authorities across England have been focused on delivering their planned salting and snow clearance to keep their local strategic road networks open. Together they had ready some 1.25 million tonnes of salt at the start of the winter. As honourable Members would expect, salt usage has been significantly above the norm for this time of year and so my department decided two weeks ago to procure, as a precautionary measure, up to an additional 250,000 tonnes of salt to replenish the strategic stockpile as salt is released to local authorities. Last Friday, DfT offered 30,000 tonnes from the strategic stockpile to local authorities to provide reassurance over the holiday period. That allocation has been taken up and will be delivered over the next few days.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10122019000282"></a>The strategic road network inevitably suffered severe disruption in the wake of heavy snowfall this weekend, but recovered reasonably rapidly and, with isolated exceptions, has operated effectively since Saturday afternoon.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10122019000283"></a>Similarly, heavy snow and the formation of ice at very low temperatures caused some disruption on rail networks on Friday and Saturday. But the rail industry has pulled together to keep essential services running, using special timetables where necessary, and I am pleased to report that commuter services into main conurbations this morning are close to normal. Transport for London has successfully followed its winter weather plans and has been able to run a near-normal service across its network. However, issues with Eurostar are ongoing and have been well reported today, including the impacts of very severe weather conditions in France.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10122019000284"></a>Disruption due to weather conditions of this extremity is inevitable. The measure of resilience is the speed of recovery of the networks from such events. On this measure, the strategic road network and the rail network have performed broadly satisfactorily, having regard to the exceptional circumstances. The experience at airports, and Heathrow in particular, has however been different. Conditions have been difficult across north- west Europe, with Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle and Schiphol all struggling to cope at times. This afternoon it has been reported that Brussels airport will close until Wednesday because of a lack of de-icer. But yesterday's whole-day virtual closure at Heathrow, coupled with continued substantially reduced capacity, presents a very real challenge from which the system will struggle to recover quickly.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_891"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 891</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10122019000285"></a>I have spoken this morning to BAA and BA, its principal user. I am clear that BA made the right call on Saturday to cancel its flights in anticipation of the closure of the airport. Had it not done so, the scenes in the terminals on Saturday night that we witnessed on our TV screens could have been much worse.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10122019000286"></a>Heathrow operates at normal times at some 98 per cent of full capacity, so when there is disruption caused by snow, or the need repeatedly to close runways or taxiways for de-icing, capacity is inevitably lost and a backlog builds up. There is still a large amount of work to be done to restore Heathrow to full capacity, and further snow and severe icing are anticipated over the next few days.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10122019000287"></a>The immediate focus at Heathrow must be on maximising the number of flights with the available infrastructure. In order for this to be done, I have agreed with BAA this morning a relaxation of restrictions on night flights for the next four days. Operating hours will be extended until 1am and arrivals for repatriation flights will be allowed through the night. None the less, BAA advises that, with further severe weather forecast, Heathrow is likely to operate at reduced capacity until Christmas.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10122019000288"></a>Conditions in the terminals overnight on Saturday were very difficult, with some 2,000 passengers stranded. Once the airport has returned to normal operation, my officials will work with BAA to understand how this situation arose and what it plans to change to ensure that we do not experience a repeat. It is clear from my discussions this morning that some preliminary conclusions have already been drawn.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10122019000289"></a>We recognise that the cost, both economic and social, of this level of disruption can be very great. Winters such as this year's and last year's have been rare in modern Britain, but we need to consider whether we are now seeing a step change in our weather that might justify investment in equipment and technologies to reduce the impact of severe temperature and heavy snowfall. I will assess advice on this subject from the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Sir John Beddington, and we will work with transport operators to examine the business case in each sector for increased investment in winter resilience where that makes sense, recognising always that spending more on winter preparedness inevitably means that there will be less to spend on other priorities.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10122019000290"></a>This is not just about making sure that people can travel and goods are delivered. Disrupted transport links, combined with cold weather, increasingly impact on other essential services. In particular, they threaten the most vulnerable in our communities. To help those most in need to stay warm in the coldest parts of the country, the Government have so far this winter paid out some £355 million in cold weather payments through an estimated 14.2 million payments to affected households. In addition, winter fuel payments for pensioners have been protected at the higher rate for this winter, with 12.9 million payments made to those older people who meet the qualifying conditions. We have also taken precautionary steps to ensure that the health services are well prepared, with local plans in place to deal with the extra demands that this type of weather brings.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10122019000291"></a>Despite these steps, weather of this severity can cause unexpected problems for many people, including those who would not normally see themselves as vulnerable but who might be in serious difficulty if their boiler breaks down or they cannot get to the chemist to collect their medication. The Local Government Association will therefore work closely with local authorities in England, with support from the Government, to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place across the country. Individual local authorities will publicise information locally on how to access these advice services ahead of the Christmas holiday period.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10122019000292"></a>Severe weather poses significant challenges to the energy supply industry. Difficult driving conditions have affected fuel oil and coal suppliers' ability to make deliveries, particularly to more remote areas away from the strategic road network. This has resulted in delivery backlogs which suppliers have been working hard, in difficult conditions, to reduce.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10122019000293"></a>Distributors are doing all they can to prioritise deliveries to vulnerable customers and those running short of fuel. Working with the Government, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers has issued a code of practice to its members to help them prioritise orders to those most in need and to alert local authorities when they are aware of a risk that potentially vulnerable households will run short of heating oil.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10122019000294"></a>The severe weather has also led to a very high forecast of demand for gas, expected to be more than 26 per cent above the normal for this time of year. As a result, the National Grid yesterday issued a gas balancing alert to provide a signal to the market to bring on additional supplies and reduce demand from large users on interruptible contracts. There is no reason to expect any disruption to domestic or commercial customers unless they have interruptible contracts in place. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has today issued a Written Statement providing more information on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10122019000295"></a>Nationally, we will continue to do whatever is necessary to support essential services and to provide advice to businesses and householders on steps they can take to help themselves and others. For example, we have published a snow code to give common-sense advice to householders and businesses to help them safely clear snow and ice from pavements and public spaces without fear of legal action. As an emergency measure, we have relaxed the enforcement of EU drivers' hours and working-time rules to mitigate the effect of the severe weather on critical parts of the supply chain that have been badly hit by the weather. We have published guidance for local highway authorities on the range of actions that can be taken to ensure optimum use of salt stocks. Over the next few days, we will publish updated technical advice based on the latest research findings, so that all authorities can adopt best practice. We have also confirmed to farmers that they can use red diesel in tractors and other equipment to help salt and clear snow from public roads during the extreme weather.</p>

These arrangements will continue in place for as long as necessary through the holiday period. I can assure the House that, wherever government action can help to ease the impact of severe weather or mitigate its effects, we will not hesitate to take such action. I commend the Statement to the House."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10122019000297"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<a name="10122019000298"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="10122019000622"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in the other place. I think that the House will have gained exactly the same impression as was gained on that earlier occasion; namely, that there is great complacency in the Statement in the face of the appalling suffering which so many of the travelling public have endured over this weekend, whether they have been trapped on railway stations without information as to when trains might arrive or caught up in traffic jams without any ability to understand when they might have a chance of escaping. More particularly, the Statement has failed to explain why, at airports, scandalously low levels of information have been given to the travelling public. I thought that the whole point of privatising many of these transport assets was that privatised companies cared about their consumers. There was not much care about consumers over this past weekend, when the advice given to individuals consisted of one telephone number which was inevitably jammed for the whole time that people were trying to get through. There was no alternative strategy for anyone to take.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10122019000299"></a>This will not do. The noble Earl says that his right honourable friend had a meeting with transport bosses today. There is no suggestion that there was any dressing down done about these failures over the weekend; instead, there was a meeting, on which they met on, I suppose, cordial terms to talk about the difficulties that the transport system has suffered. This is not good enough in circumstances where so many people have suffered so much.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10122019000300"></a>Regarding airports, particularly London Heathrow, it is also important that we protect our national reputation. Whether we like it or not, London Heathrow is a gateway to much of the world and a lot of people get their experience of Britain from Heathrow. Consequently, the chaos over this last weekend has produced real difficulties and I would have expected the Government to have responded in rather more forthright terms than the Statement has suggested.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10122019000301"></a>The noble Earl referred to the Quarmby report.  He knows that in the summer that report produced  28 recommendations. He indicated in the Statement that only a certain number of these recommendations have been carried through. We will be able to see, with the full publication of the report, just where negligence has occurred. It will not do for the noble Earl to indicate that the Government had no warning of this. We did learn from last winter; that is why the Quarmby  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_894"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 894</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inquiry was set up. The report was presented in good time-by July of this year. Why, therefore, have the Government not taken more forthright actions?</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10122019000302"></a>There are several points that specialists in the field have also indicated. I would have thought Ministers would have expected this sort of expertise and advice to be available to them in the department and acted upon. What is this nonsense about lorries jack-knifing in the middle lanes of motorways and blocking the whole motorway? Why on earth has it not been recognised that, in circumstances such as the very difficult travel conditions this weekend, some restrictions should have been put, as the AA recommended, upon the movement of lorries so that they stayed only in the inside lane? I recognise the disadvantages and inconvenience to lorry drivers, but, my goodness, that is as nothing to the blocking of the whole M25 or parts of the M40 by jack-knifed lorries.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10122019000303"></a>Why is it, with our rail system, that information is not readily available to customers? You can have railway lines which are only six miles apart and at the station where you ask the question and at which they are experiencing delays on the line, they have no idea whether it would make sense to get across to the other line, which might be running a fairly good service. The system does not know, or the people are not equipped to deliver the service they should. It is a reflection of the very limited resources that have been put into customer care and that is why, in these circumstances where great difficulty occurs, it is the passenger who suffers.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10122019000304"></a>Finally, it was timely, this weekend, that a Member of Parliament and close friend of the Prime Minister should have indulged in a little light relief on the virtues of chaos theory. I am talking about the leading party in the Government, the Conservative Party. He said something like, "We do not think much to planning in our party, we think that planning can be overemphasised and it might be that a certain amount of chaos theory should obtain". Well, no one in the coalition should be preaching chaos theory regarding transport this weekend. A bit of thought by Ministers, a bit of planning, and some of the difficulties that our fellow countrymen and others have faced might have been minimised.</p>

There is no complacency on the part of the Government; we are acutely aware of the challenges. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is giving clear and strategic leadership to all concerned. He does not give a dressing down to operators; he gives encouragement and leadership. The noble Lord made much of the difficulties of communicating in the current situation. Yes, of course there is disappointment, but there are a lot of people affected and it is a very obscure situation.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10122019000306"></a>The noble Lord is right to say how important Heathrow is to the country and, indeed, to the world. One of the problems at Heathrow is clearing the aircraft stands of snow when those aircraft stands are occupied by aircraft. If there is no aircraft in the

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10122019000307"></a>The noble Lord suggests restrictions on HGV operators and drivers. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all commercial vehicle drivers who work so hard in very difficult conditions to keep our shops and businesses supplied.</p>

I stress how important it is to take note of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. The problem that we suffer is a lack of communication. To anybody who listened to the Radio 4 interviews with passengers at Heathrow and Gatwick, the information that was repeatedly conveyed was that none of them knew what was going on.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10122019000309"></a>A few weeks ago, at the beginning of the month, we had similar snowfall and people are really tired of not knowing how our rail network is working in this country. At Victoria Station, it was obvious that none of the indicators was working and the announcements were almost impossible to decipher. Whenever one got the idea that a train was leaving, one jumped into that train, sat for half an hour and was then told that the train was no longer going. One moved on to another train, only to be told that the driver was no longer available. One then moved on to another train where they said it would be another half an hour. By the time one gets home, it has taken three or three and a half hours to travel a distance of 15 miles.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10122019000310"></a>This just will not do. It is time that those in authority provided adequate information to those who use services. That has not happened at Heathrow, it does not happen at many of our stations and it is about time that this matter is put right.</p>

<p><a name="st_269"></a>
<a name="10122019000311"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="10122019000625"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for my noble friend's comments. Ministers were not happy about the situation on communicating the transport opportunities to people two weeks ago. It is inconceivable that these problems will not be considered in the  new year.</p>

<p><a name="st_270"></a>
<a name="10122019000312"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew100"></a><a name="10122019000626"></a>Lord Beecham:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. In addition to talking to BAA, will Ministers also talk to the airline operators about the need for them to inform their customers and to ensure, together with BAA and other airport operators, that every attention is paid to the needs of people who may, unfortunately, be stranded.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10122019000313"></a>Secondly, will the Government look again at stopping the Warm Front programme applications? While it is certainly true, as the Statement made clear, that fuel payments have been made, the programme of insulating homes will be slowed. It is obviously too late, in any event, to make a difference this winter, but given what has happened in the past couple of years, does the Minister agree that it might be necessary to look again at that decision in order that there should not be an hiatus in the insulation programme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10122019000314"></a>Thirdly, on the steps taken by the health service and local authorities, does the Minister agree that it might be desirable to look at whether extra resources might be needed, in certain parts of the country, in order for the health service to cope with the additional demands and pressures that might arise and, indeed, for something like the Bellwin rules-which, I understand, are to be abolished under the new dispensation-to be looked at in relation to local authorities?</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10122019000315"></a>Finally, on a more domestic concern, will the Minister look at conditions within this House and consider whether it is desirable to turn the heating off on a Friday, leaving this place to be extremely cold for the staff and your Lordships on a Monday?</p>

<p><a name="st_271"></a>
<a name="10122019000316"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="10122019000627"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, I think I mentioned in my Statement-I apologise if the Statement does not say it-that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has had discussions with Willie Walsh at BA and I expect that Ministers or senior officials will have talked to leaders of other airlines to work out a way forward in order to minimise the effect on travelling passengers.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10122019000317"></a>The noble Lord talked about the Warm Front scheme. It is slightly outside the scope of the Statement, but I appreciate the current difficulties of houses being very cold. We are experiencing it a little in your Lordships' House. It is a little colder than normal. Fortunately, I am not responsible for the conditions inside your Lordships' House, but I always take the precaution of putting on extra clothes on a Monday morning.</p>

<a name="10122019000318"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew102"></a><a name="10122019000628"></a>Lord King of Bridgwater:</b> My Lords, does the Minister agree that the contribution from the Front Bench opposite was particularly ludicrous in what could become an extremely serious situation? To try to make political capital out of that at this time does no service to the responsibility that people have in this House. The idea that somehow you can guarantee to keep everything running whatever the weather is wrong. I sat on a plane in Zurich airport for eight hours while they tried to de-ice it. It iced up again and then they de-iced it and within a quarter of an hour the pilot came back and said, "Our time is up and we will have to abandon the flight altogether". It is impossible to guard against that.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10122019000319"></a>The seriousness of the Statement that my noble friend repeated is in the weather forecast going forward. There are a lot of very frightened people in this country now, in rural areas and other areas as well. There are worries about supplies of fuel oil, petrol and heating generally, and breakdowns in electricity substations are the sort of problem that can come from very severe weather. The country is entitled to expect from this House cohesive action together; consideration as to how we can tackle what may be some very serious problems in the weeks ahead.</p>

The short answer is that my right honourable friend could not do much more. The weather conditions that we are experiencing are unprecedented. We have not had such a cold December since 1910.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10122019000321"></a>My noble friend mentioned fuel oil supplies. They should be okay. Backlogs are mounting up of several days and we are monitoring the situation carefully. My right honourable friend has already relaxed the drivers' hours regulations for drivers moving essential supplies in order to help reduce the backlog.</p>

<p><a name="st_274"></a>
<a name="10122019000322"></a><b><a name="101220-0002.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="10122019000630"></a>Lord Morris of Handsworth:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement, but I detect a deep sense of complacency-not on the Minister's part but running throughout the Government. While we have heard a lot of excuses, we have not heard any plans or action programmes for dealing with the matter. Are there any steps to set out a list of priority users? Has the OFT been alerted to ensure that oil suppliers do not profiteer in the current circumstances? Can we be assured that the emergency services will not have to compete with other users of oil? Has COBRA met? What plans is it offering to the various people who will be affected? Will the Minister say when we will get some real action rather than soft words?</p>

<p><a name="st_275"></a>

One of the things that we need to avoid is getting out a long screwdriver and sticking it in places where it would be unhelpful.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10122019000324"></a>The noble Lord asked some important questions about fuel supplies for emergency services. I would be very surprised if the emergency services were not careful to ensure that their fuel stocks never go below a certain level so that they do not have to go into the market at precisely the wrong time, which is right now, when we need to avoid panic buying.</p>

If there is an appeal, people respond. Far more important is the problem of low blood supplies. Will the Minister pass on to his colleagues in the Department of Health the need to tell people where they can give blood? In the press there have been notifications that blood stocks are dangerously low, but there is nothing about where people can go in difficult snowbound areas to give blood. Many people will do that. Type O negative is particularly important.</p>

There is a large population of 4x4 vehicles. Some people call them Chelsea tractors. Now they can be useful to society and people can volunteer to help local voluntary groups to move people who cannot otherwise move around. Although the strategic road network is pretty well completely clear, the side roads are not clear.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10122019000327"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned blood supplies. I am not aware of the current situation with blood supplies, but I will pass her comments on to my noble friend Lord Howe. As for heating supplies, I understand that most hospitals run on gas and only a few use oil. I imagine that they would be very careful not to run their stocks down too much at this time of year.</p>

They have been keeping hospitals open. They have enabled the sick to come in and have kept people in who could not go home. The National Health Service has risen brilliantly to the challenge. I declare an interest as chairman of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. It is time for the NHS to receive the praise that it deserves.</p>

Does he accept that many of the pavements in London-and I am sure elsewhere-are extremely slippery. They were this morning. The danger is that the health service will be burdened by even more people who slip and break their arms and legs. Is it not more economic to put more salt on pavements-or in some cases put some salt on pavements-rather than have ambulances and the health service having to bear the burden of what seems to be a niggardly approach to distributing the salt?</p>

As for pavements, local people can clear them. The Statement that I repeated referred to the fact that people can clear the pavement if they want to. But the noble Lord is right to raise the issue of increased levels of injury through slipping. It is a big problem. A fall for people in their later years can be very serious indeed.</p>

I shall be disappointed if he does not. Has my noble friend's department considered legislating for the use of winter tyres, as they do in Scandinavia? Is he satisfied by the supply of winter tyres?

They are effective, but it is a personal choice and it would be peculiar for the Government to take any steps to mandate them.

They did so for many hundreds of people this morning from Scotland to London. As I passed through Glasgow Airport this morning, it was very clear to me just how important Heathrow Airport is to the travel plans, whether for family reunions or business or holidays, of many of my fellow west of Scotland citizens at this time of year. I heard the Minister, in repeating the Statement made in the other place, pray in aid the statistic that Heathrow is used to 98 per cent of its capacity as a reason for the fragility of that environment-and I agree with him. As I understand it, the Government have no plans to increase the capacity of Heathrow, so they must have strategic plans to reduce its usage. Are those going to be part of the discussions that take place between his right honourable friend Philip Hammond, the Minister, BAA and the operators out of Heathrow? If they are not, we are going to face this problem repeatedly every time it snows, and that airport will be closed.</p>

To follow on from the point made by his noble friend Lord Dholakia, does he agree that the most irritating aspect of the delay and dislocation is not the fact that things go wrong, because we can all accept the case that they do, but the lack of information to passengers or customers, or whatever the industry likes to call them? Will he accept that industries such as the railway industry-I suspect that this is true of the aviation industry, too-whether publicly or privately owned, are overmanaged and undersupervised? The largely junior staff who have to face the ire of the public are no wiser about what is going on than  the people concerned. Would he knock a few heads together to ensure that senior managers are there to make decisions and to face the travelling public when things go wrong?</p>

These people are working outside in absolutely freezing conditions to keep transport equipment working, and I think we should all be very grateful to them. Yet again, another noble Lord has raised the issue of the lack of information about what transport services can do. Ministers are acutely aware of this problem; we are not happy about it. I also stress the point that we must not interfere at the moment but, when it is all over, we will be talking very closely with the transport industry to see what can be done in future so that passengers know what can be done.</p>

It seems to many noble Lords strange that Heathrow seems able to cope much less well with the severe conditions than other London airports. As my noble friend said, that was the case with Stansted Airport from Scotland, as opposed to the situation at Heathrow, which had only one runway still operating. Will the Minister press the BAA to ensure that additional resources are made available and that Heathrow Airport itself, a very profitable organisation, is forced to ensure that it can cope better in future? Will he address the issue not just of information to passengers who are stranded but of facilities available to them? Some passengers have been sleeping for three or four nights on cold floors. The airline operators or BAA must make some facility available, be it blankets or pillows or whatever, so that people who have nowhere to go will be properly looked after in the short term.</p>

I am delighted to see how many noble Lords have decided to take part in it, and I know that a number of others, for reasons of snow and the fact that we already had a large list, have decided not to take part. There is a lot of interest in this subject, and it is something on which there is a great deal of agreement both in your Lordships' House and outside. That agreement is partly the point of the debate, because what we need now is some action.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10122019000348"></a>Professional education in the 20th century has done a wonderful job, not least in the United Kingdom. Life expectancy in the world as a whole has doubled in the century, but the outside world has changed, which means that there is a need for a change in education. There is a broad consensus on what needs to happen, and we can see it happening in many of our leading schools already. As Richard Horton, the editor of the <I>Lancet</I>, has put it:</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000435"></a>"health professionals today are not adequately prepared to address the present and coming health challenges-aging populations, chronic diseases, cultural diversity and higher public expectations".</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000410"></a>It is, if you like, the necessary move from a purely doctor and hospital-based model to something much more diverse and local, more community and more person-based. That was a goal of the last Government and I know that it is a goal of this Government. The difficulty as always is to make it happen.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10122019000349"></a>This Question is about global health and the emerging new discipline of global health. Let me explain why I think it is relevant here. I am talking about global health, not international health, which is what we talked about in the last century when we talked about the health of other people. Global health is about the health of all of us-all the issues that affect us all, wherever we are in the world. It is about our interdependence in terms of disease and how it can fly around the world very quickly; in the 14th century, it took three winters for the Black Death to get across Europe, whereas it took three days for SARS to get around the world earlier this century. We are also interdependent in our use of the same staffing and resources and interdependent in terms of the environment  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_902"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 902</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and climate change. All kinds of issues affect our health and we began to understand them much better in this past decade than we ever did before.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10122019000350"></a>The second reason is that the diseases from which we suffer have been changing. There are many more non-communicable diseases, and in that context context itself is vital. We are beginning to understand better the social, behavioural, cultural and economic aspects of global health, and the emerging discipline is about taking on these issues and about understanding and acting on the wider determinants of health. Education needs to do this as well.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10122019000351"></a>Thirdly, global health is about recognising that health is about health systems and how healthcare is delivered to individuals and populations. It is not just the theory of the laboratory and lecture room but the reality of the clinic and the community.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10122019000352"></a>The fourth point that drives very many people is that experience in other countries is extremely valuable to us in the UK. Many who are involved in global health are driven by a passion to do something in poorer countries, but it is good for the UK as well. It develops people personally and they can learn from new examples and new experiences, and of course learn about some of the people living in their own country whose origins may have been far away.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10122019000353"></a>Let me refer to the recent Lancet commission report that was published at the end of November, called <I>Health</I><I></I><I>P</I><I>rofessionals for a </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>C</I><I>entury</I><I>:</I><I></I><I>T</I><I>ransforming </I><I>E</I><I>ducation to </I><I>S</I><I>trengthen </I><I>H</I><I>ealth </I><I>S</I><I>ystems in an </I><I>I</I><I>nterdependent </I><I>W</I><I>orld</I>. The commission was chaired by Julio Frenk of the Harvard School of Public Health, and by Lincoln Chen of the China Medical Board, of which I was privileged to be a member. This was the first such attempt to look globally, with a global set of commissioners, and to learn from innovation everywhere in the world-not just Europe and America-and to do so across all professions on which we could collect data. It draws out some key lessons about how education needs to happen in the future: about how it needs to be interprofessional and transprofessional, going across disciplines and outside them to involve the public. Education needs to be competence-based, systems-based and IT-enabled.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10122019000354"></a>The report also shows how our institutions need to change, breaking down barriers and connecting not just across disciplines but going outside health across locations and countries. Let me mention just one example that brings it alive: the IHI Open School. There are now 80 chapters in universities across world in 28 countries. This is a coming together of medical students to learn via the internet about subjects that are not covered in traditional courses: quality improvement, systems thinking and such like. They are studying in one school, maybe in the UK, but adding to it from elsewhere. This is the sort of model that I think we will continue to see.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10122019000355"></a>The final point about the report is that it talks about transformational education: the effort to create professionals who are able to lead and make change in today's changed world. A brief illustration of the wide-ranging thinking on this in this country can be seen from the activities of two groups: Alma Mata and Medsin. Alma Mata is a 1,000-strong group of junior  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_903"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 903</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>doctors and young health professionals from other disciplines. Medsin is also about 1,000-strong and made up of medical students. They advocate precisely that global health should be included in the syllabus and set out their vision for the doctor of the future, which is very important as they are the doctors of the future.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10122019000356"></a>It is encouraging to see that the establishment is responding, including the Royal Colleges-and we have two former presidents of Royal Colleges speaking in this debate. To take one example, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is very concerned about the lack of support for junior doctors who want to work overseas and who want to include that in their training and not be disadvantaged in their careers by doing so. There are also organisations such as the London International Development Centre, which works with six London institutions and runs, among other things, courses of students as global citizens. There is a very much wider view here about what needs to change. Indeed, developments in partnerships between institutions are very ably supported by THET, and I am delighted to know that Her Majesty's Government through DfID have launched an even more substantial scheme to promote these partnerships.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10122019000357"></a>There is a lot happening in the UK, but this is a worldwide phenomenon and things are moving faster in the US and Scandinavia than here. I can imagine the Minister saying, "Very good, we're happy to encourage this, but what has this got to do with Government and the Department of Health?". My answer is that it really does have an impact on us. I stress that this sort of activity is not just for the benefit of foreigners; it is about creating better health professionals who are better able to care for people of this country with our 21st-century diseases and lifestyles.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10122019000358"></a>I suggest three actions. The first is extremely practical. I ask officials in the noble Earl's department to report to him on what more can be done to help trainee doctors to spend some time abroad as part of their training and to do so in some numbers, not with the odd one or two who take a risk with their careers. That would make this much more mainstream and much more positive.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10122019000359"></a>Secondly, the Minister's department should meet the universities and the professional education schools of medicine and nursing and the wider health schools to consider the findings of the <I>Lancet</I> commission and decide what action might jointly be taken to develop the education of health professionals and to get some impetus and coordination behind the moves that are happening all over this country.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10122019000360"></a>My third request is that the Minister's department provides active support for the involvement of NHS people and organisations in the DfID programme of partnership, recognising that this is a difficult time for the NHS but making it clear from the top that this is good thing for people to be engaged in. It is about the future, and there may even be ways of looking at things like the newly announced early retirement scheme, which might actually help in developing these sorts of programmes.</p>

His natural modesty precludes him detailing his extensive work. He is, in fact, joint chairman of the Global Health Workforce Alliance, which is giving a new impetus to the subject nationally and internationally. His report, entitled <I>Global Health Partnerships</I>, graciously gives credit to the many initiatives in this field, especially to THET, which was set up by that pioneer Professor Eldryd Parry.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10122019000362"></a>Medical students have for years spent several months of their clinical training working in developing countries and gaining valuable insight into global medicine. King's, Guy's, St Thomas's, St. George's and UCL are already running courses on the subject. A great deal is going on, but much more could be done. We can encourage more partnerships to be set up between medical schools in the UK and developing countries, for instance the new medical schools in Ethiopia. The medical schools and hospitals here need to make it easier for our graduates to go to those countries for longer periods, not only to enjoy invaluable new clinical experiences but to help medical students abroad to achieve their goals. They can increase their help to the medical students out there by demonstrating physical signs, new ways of teaching, how to get the best out of their libraries, data collection and so on.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10122019000363"></a>There is unprecedented interest among medical students in helping to develop this field, and good organisations are at work, as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recently drew attention to the need for the NHS to help to plan the work abroad of junior doctors. In Guy's Hospital in 1972 we set up a comprehensive surgical training programme involving a large part of the south-east of England. One of the years of the seven-year programme had to be spent abroad, and that proved very popular.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10122019000364"></a>With the hospital ship part of the charity Mercy Ships, we not only provide free surgical treatment to the poorest of the poor but we teach the local surgeons the kind of operations that are appropriate in their country given their available resources. For instance, in Togo this year three Togolese eye surgeons were taught the best way of removing cataracts without the need for the expensive equipment that is used in  the West and cannot be afforded in Africa. Now one surgeon is at work in the north of Togo, one in the south and one in between, so they cover the whole country.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10122019000365"></a>An example of the excellent work done by many of the doctors in global health is a junior trainee at Guy's Hospital called Abigail Boys. She works for Mercy Ships intermittently and has done so for the past six years. She came across a 13 year-old girl in Ghana whose tumour of her face was too complicated for Mercy Ships to cope with, so she raised thousands of pounds to bring her to the Royal London Hospital, where she had an amazing 11-hour operation, which was carried out successfully by the distinguished surgeon Iain Hutchison, whose wife enhances the Benches

I had a quick look at his biography, and three areas stand out: his experience of the National Health Service, his involvement as a fellow of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and, above all, his political interest in the developing world. It should come as no surprise that he has chosen global health and medical education for this short debate. No longer can we simply concentrate on learning about what is appropriate for the health of people in the United Kingdom; we have to take into account post-war migration and our interdependency with other nations. We also have to accept that the process of globalisation crosses the geographical boundaries of all nations.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10122019000367"></a>The globalising economy relies increasingly on the skills of people wherever they are available, and international migration is a key factor in ensuring that Britain benefits from this phenomenon. I shall give an analogy. Climate change is not restricted to a single nation. Last week we dealt with the outcomes of the Cancun climate conference. For the first time there is an international commitment to,</p>
<ul><a name="10122019000436"></a>"deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions".</ul>
<p><a name="10122019000411"></a>Here is a recognition that a nation cannot act alone. The Medsin UK response on global health acknowledges that the health of people in every nation is interconnected. A global health approach seeks to understand how individuals and population health are determined by global, as well as local, factors.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10122019000368"></a>I realised the need for an international dimension to training when some years ago my wife and I had returned to rural Sussex following a visit to India. After some days, despite having taken malarial precautions, my wife developed a fever. The local doctors could not make a diagnosis and her condition deteriorated. She thought that despite all the precautions she had contracted malaria, and decided to take her temperature at regular intervals. The results demonstrated that she probably had malaria. The doctors were not convinced and took her blood to look for parasites, but they did not find any as they took it at the wrong time of day. She remained undiagnosed and decided to treat herself. She obtained medication and worked out the appropriate doses and timing of the medication. I am pleased to say that, after six weeks of being ill, she made an almost instant recovery.</p>

<a name="101220-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10122019000369"></a>Let me say that many medical colleges have recognised the need for global health issues. My daughter, who qualified at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, decided to go to Brazil for her elective experience. She was fortunate during that period not only to spend time in the cities of that country but to work in  the Amazon rainforest, which brought home to her  the realities of a broader aspect of health, including the impact of poverty on the health of deprived communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10122019000370"></a>There are a number of factors that we need to take into account. I urge the Minister to look at the broader determinants identified by Medsin UK: health financing, human rights, migration and environment. I am tempted to criticise the Government's points-based system of immigration, but I shall refrain from doing so. Suffice it to say that the treatment of overseas doctors by the previous Administration was shameful; we continually moved the goalposts, and many of them suffered serious hardship when having to return to their country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10122019000371"></a>The present cutbacks in university funding at about 6 per cent, which was announced today, are likely to impact on medical colleges. There is already evidence that some universities will no longer be able to afford training in certain disciplines. It is vital that knowledge is shared with countries abroad. Numerous good practices have been developed in countries such as Taiwan from which we can learn. India is making tremendous headway in providing medical tourism. It is also providing medicines at a much lower cost than we do in this country.</p>

When I visited Ethiopia, there were those in the healthcare professions who valued his knowledge and advice. That, to my mind, is the acceptable face of our contribution to the third world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10122019000374"></a>On 5 May 2009, Barack Obama, in announcing a $63 billion programme of global health, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10122019000425"></a>"We will not be successful in our efforts to end deaths from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis unless we do more to improve health systems around the world, focus our efforts on child and maternal health, and ensure that best practices drive the funding for these programs".</p>

<p><a name="10122019000412"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, to whom I am grateful for initiating this debate, remarked that the USA and certain other countries are well ahead of us in developing global health as a universal programme of the country. That is not to say that many universities in our land have not embraced the issue of global health. I declare an interest. I am affiliated with the University of Dundee in many ways. I am proud that the university has a module in year two of medical students' training that gives them knowledge and some experience of global health. We run a summer school on a yearly basis that advances epidemiology and global health issues and we also have a major research programme in the university for developing drugs for the less well known tropical diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10122019000375"></a>There are also other universities, including UCL and KCL, which have also started such programmes. We need to do the same as the United States has done and drive this further, to develop a university consortium of global health in the United Kingdom that promotes learning, education, scholarships and also research. That is something we need to address and it could be addressed by the Department of Health because it is primarily a health issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10122019000376"></a>Both our research organisations, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, have major research programmes and fellowships that drive them. My college, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, has programmes for global health but the constraint has been the ability to find funding for trainees who wish to take part in overseas training as part of their training. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have such programmes. The modules that these trainees undertake overseas are accredited on a case by case basis. The funding, however, is not available and neither is there flexibility in specialist training. That is something that again the Department of Health can assist with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10122019000377"></a>I am privileged to be associated with an international organisation that has developed training and service in areas of obstetric fistula from which some 2 million women worldwide suffer. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, has worked in this area and he referred to his commitment to working with Mercy Ships. He deserves the gratitude of those women in areas in which he has worked for years. We have developed a curriculum for training in this area of obstetric fistula which has now been accepted by all the obstetric fistula surgeons worldwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10122019000378"></a>The organisation also works with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, receiving funding from them of more than $10 million over a period of five years to develop a strengthened health system across the United Kingdom. In that respect, Scotland has a programme with which the University of Dundee is heavily involved, including a programme in Malawi for health systems. Our fifth-year medical students go there for attachment for a period of six weeks on a yearly basis.</p>

Academic health science centres are by their nature well suited to promote and give leadership to this subject since they bring together research into global diseases, medical training-which can now be delivered remotely and is anyway a highly international business-and clinical care. The four members of King's Health Partners-King's College London, Guy's and St Thomas's, King's College Hospital and the South London and Maudsley-already have individually a proud and established history in various areas of global health. We have had a 10-year partnership with the Tropical Health and Education Trust-THET-to which other speakers have referred. This

We also have partnerships with the University of California, San Francisco and two other organisations that have been mentioned in this debate: Medsin, the national student global health network, and Alma Mata, the national postgraduate doctor global health network, both of which were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10122019000382"></a>Being located in south London, where there are such ethnically and culturally diverse communities, this work has local as well as international significance. As others have said, global health these days is not a matter of looking outward to other countries; it begins and has relevance at home. It also has a strategic significance at the national level, which I do not think has been mentioned by other speakers. Quite rightly, investment in reducing inequalities within and between countries is integral to Untied Kingdom and EU global security strategies. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said that action now needs to be taken. King's Health Partners can claim to be taking that action. We seek to bring together the expertise that exists in the various parts of our partnership. We recently agreed to set up a King's Health Partners global health board, in addition to the board of the partnership.</p>

Having recently attended a half-day seminar on the subject at King's Health Partners, I saw what a great interest was expressed. The hall was packed to the gunnels. Like others, I eagerly look forward to what the Minister will say in response to the suggestions that have been made this evening to give a boost to this important and internationally vital work.</p>

I declare an interest as chair of the international medical aid charity Merlin, which operates in the poorest countries after conflict and natural disasters. It is from that perspective that I want to speak this evening.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10122019000385"></a>There is a long and fine tradition of trained British doctors and medical staff working in poor countries, bringing expertise, training medical staff on the ground and saving lives. To take one example, more than 70 NHS staff with different skills have worked with Merlin surgical teams in the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti. This should not be seen just as altruism, important though that is. As the noble Lord, Lord McColl said, it should be encouraged as part of medical training in this country. Like so much in today's world, medicine is global. This country will benefit directly if the doctors and other medical staff working here bring with them first-hand experience of conditions and diseases elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10122019000386"></a>To give one other example, health staff who worked with Merlin on HIV and TB control programmes in Russia and Kenya have gone on to work in an NHS trust that covers Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham,

That is to our advantage, as well as the advantage of those they are helping in other countries. So I do strongly support the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, that medical training and practice in the UK should encourage and certainly not disadvantage those many British medical staff who wish to spend part of their training or part of their professional life working in poor countries. It seems to me heartening that so many medical staff training and working here should want to spend time working in developing countries and it is very much in our interest that we should encourage them in that laudable aim. There are, of course, problems but it really is in our interest to overcome those and to encourage, for example, deans of medical schools  to use their existing discretion to encourage staff to serve in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="10122019000413"></a>Indeed we do, but it seems to me that working in developing countries and the experience our staff get there is an essential part of achieving that objective. We are right to be proud of the quality of our medical staff in this country and we are right to be proud, too, of those who wish to spend time helping others in poorer countries. Those two things should go together and not in any way be in conflict. It is very much in our interest that that should be so and, like others, I look forward to the Minister's comments on that particular point.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10122019000389"></a>Eight years ago I was in Malawi as a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health. We were looking at health provision in that country generally as well as focusing on maternal health. It was of course at the height of the AIDS epidemic in Malawi. I have never forgotten the visit we had to one of the hospitals there. From the distance we saw a pleasant enough building but as we entered the gates we saw people lying on rough, old blankets on the grass outside, brought in by relatives who needed to get back to their own work as quickly as possible, there being no help at all out in the villages outside the hospital. Inside the hospital itself, every ward was packed with dying AIDS patients; on bedsteads, on mattresses under the bedsteads and packed in between the beds. We saw ward after ward of human misery in a hospital totally unable to cope. Those patients received no treatment except some rehydration if they were lucky. It was a scene from hell.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10122019000390"></a>At that time, for a population of around 10 million, there were 43 doctors in Malawi and so few nurses in that hospital that it was coping with well over 100 patients to each nurse. Even with that scant provision there was a 40 per cent vacancy rate. The staff were exhausted  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_910"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 910</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and demoralised and many had left after their training to work in South Africa or Europe where they could be guaranteed decent work experience and in-service training. It was not just the poor salaries that drove them away; and who could blame them?</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10122019000391"></a>The Malawi Government soon resolved to take action and with overseas aid, including, I am glad to say, a good deal from our own Department for International Development, more staff were trained. Salaries were increased combined with contracts to stay in Malawi. Students' fees were paid if they contracted to work for at least three years after qualification and volunteer doctors were brought in from abroad-yes, also from this country-to provide in-service training to staff and better care to patients. Of course the advent of anti-retroviral drugs for AIDS stemmed  the tide of that scourge. Healthcare is now slowly improving in Malawi, but very slowly.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10122019000392"></a>What can we learn from this? First, we must make our doctors and nurses aware of these problems. We can do this by better education at undergraduate and postgraduate level-deans, please note. We must make it easier for young doctors to take a year out in the developing world. The current pressure on them in their postgraduate training prevents this, because it does not count towards their certificate of complete training and the year abroad will not be recognised by the NHS. Sabbaticals are difficult to obtain. I have discovered that they need something called an "out of programme experience", and the bureaucracy involved makes it more like an out of body experience. It is a huge deterrent to young people wanting to go abroad. Hospital trusts will not want to employ locums and there is no national directive to encourage them to release doctors.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10122019000393"></a>The national conscience should dictate that we help developing countries to upgrade their health systems. Their staff have helped our National Health Service for decades at the expense of their own people in their own countries. It is payback time and I hope the Minister can reassure us that action will be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10122019000397"></a>I should briefly like to give one practical example of nursing's contribution to healthcare in this context. I returned just two weeks ago from a visit with my small NGO, the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust, to the hill tribe people in Chin state in Burma. They are of course suffering at the hands of that country's brutal military regime, but many people in Chin's hill tribes in remote areas are denied access to any healthcare at all. An outstanding young man from Chin state grew up seeing women die in childbirth on kitchen tables, and children dying unnecessarily from diarrhoea because of lack of access to healthcare and lack of any health knowledge. He was determined to become a doctor. He qualified in Armenia and immediately returned, having overcome many difficulties as a doctor, and is now training 315 community health workers from villages deep inside Chin state, where there is no healthcare. As much of this training could be undertaken equally effectively by community nurses and midwives, I introduced this resourceful young doctor to the College of Nursing in Mizoram state in India, where the staff are deeply interested in remote-area primary healthcare and have become interested in his programme. Nurses from the United Kingdom are very willing to help to train these community health workers, who are taking back life-saving knowledge and healthcare to the villages that previously had nothing. Many lives have already been saved.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10122019000398"></a>I ask the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government will continue to support the nursing profession's capability to respond to global healthcare needs, both in educational initiatives and in practical terms, such as in international partnerships and secondments, to which reference has been made in the medical field, to those developing countries. Secondments benefit those in the developing countries and employers here in the United Kingdom, because practitioners return with enhanced initiative, knowledge, skills and experience-particularly those which transcend cultural borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10122019000399"></a>I could give many other examples from our experiences Sudan, Nigeria and East Timor inter alia, but I hope that the example I have given from Burma reinforces the importance of this significant subject raised by my noble friend.</p>

I should like to discuss attempts to develop  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_912"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 912</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater awareness of global mental health issues, particularly in postgraduate psychiatric training by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and I declare an interest as a former president of the college.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="1012211000004"></a>With the help of Professor Rachel Jenkins of King's College, a scheme called the college volunteer programme was established about five years ago. We had wanted to set up a programme with VSO, as two other colleges had done, but this was difficult because VSO responds to requests for volunteers and it was not receiving requests for psychiatrists. In a way, that indicates the low priority given to, or low recognition of, mental health issues in many of the countries where VSO works. Therefore, we set up our own programme and gained agreement to the principle of out-of-programme placements abroad, fully approved for higher training. We put in place some safeguards, which included an in-country mentor providing supervision of all placements, with supplementary e-mail supervision from a UK-based consultant who had relevant overseas experience and who would have helped to prepare the volunteer in advance.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="1012211000005"></a>The intention was threefold, as I shall set out, although not in any particular order. The first was to provide a training experience in global mental health for UK trainees so that they would better understand the health perspectives and needs of migrant communities here in the UK. The second was to do that through meeting an identified need in the host country in a sustainable way. Often such needs were identified through our own college members and fellows who live and work in low and middle-income countries around the world. The third was to ensure that trainees would be equipped and motivated to be able to contribute to health services in low and middle-income countries in the future.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="1012211000006"></a>A number of mental health trusts have set up a specific link with a country, and I give as an example the trust where I have an honorary consultant contract-the South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust. While I was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, I talked to the chair of the mental health trust about ways in which he could help us to develop our volunteer programme. We thought that Ghana would be a good country with which to establish a relationship, partly because of its political stability but also because we were aware that the trust employed a number of Ghanaian staff, and the catchment population included many West Africans. The scheme at our trust was helped off the ground by a charity called Challenges Worldwide, which helped to set things up in Ghana. The scheme involved the trainee volunteer forgoing one month's salary to cover the overheads involved in setting up the placement. The royal college fundraises to provide bursaries to support trainees' travel costs. I shall quote two recent trainees who have each spent three months in Ghana. One said:</p>

Does the Minister agree that the value to the NHS  of supporting training placements overseas far outweighs any short-term local costs? Also, can he confirm that all medical postgraduate curricula include core competences in global health issues, and will he comment on what more the professional regulatory bodies can do to ensure that enough appropriately supervised and integrated global health training placements are provided so that trainees have a realistic chance of acquiring some of those core competences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="1012211000009"></a>Good health in one country cannot be maintained if there is widespread ill health and disease in so many others. I have always felt privileged to be able to participate in debates in your Lordships' House when such expertise and personal commitment is shown and, as so many noble Lords have said tonight, in a globalised and interdependent world, one in which disease certainly knows no boundaries, health is a global issue. The rich world has a responsibility to the developing world to support the growth of their health infrastructures and the growth of their medical education.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="1012211000010"></a>The nature of our responsibilities includes without doubt the need for overseas doctors to train in the UK without unacceptable barriers being placed in their way, or expense, and indeed the need for UK doctors to spend time abroad. We recognise that is a legitimate part of their qualifications, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and others. It also includes the need to prepare our own UK-based doctors for the implications and effect of globalisation in our own health service and the UK population. The noble Lord is quite right-our medical training must encompass this challenge and its complexity.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="1012211000011"></a>The previous Government, with no small help, I suspect, from the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, produced <I>Health is global: a UK Government strategy 2008-13</I> in September 2008. In it there was recognition of the fact that a healthy population is fundamental to prosperity, security and stability. It also linked the Government's domestic and international objectives to the issue of improving global health. Could the Minister tell the House, therefore, what the Government are doing to continue this work? Has the department embraced the recommendations contained in that strategy?</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="1012211000012"></a>We can look at the threat that global disease can pose. SARS and swine flu are two of the most dramatic examples where the world had to work together to protect itself. There is no doubt that a weakness in the healthcare in one country can put millions at risk. Nearer to home, however, in the UK, and particularly in London, we only have to think about TB and the communities most at risk. I am reminded of this by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who questioned me many times when I was a Minister about this.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_914"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 914</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="1012211000013"></a>Seventy-two per cent of UK cases of TB are among people born abroad, and about 40 per cent of cases in England are in London. It is vital, therefore, that the health service in London understands the nature of this problem, the communities at risk, and what needs to happen. The increase in migration into the UK means that UK doctors treat patients from all over the world, and medical students must be prepared for this change and understand its implications.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="1012211000014"></a>The report, <I>Tomorrow's Doctors</I>, referred to by several noble Lords, has very wise words on these matters. It says that this is,</p>
<ul><a name="1012211000070"></a>"leading to demands for greater cultural competency in the doctor-patient interaction".</ul>
<p><a name="1012211000051"></a>That is quite right. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="1012211000062"></a>"Medical students have to be prepared carefully for this change, with curricula exposing them to an understanding of why migration happens and specific migrant health issues as well as how to treat a broad range of diseases not routinely seen in the UK".</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="1012211000015"></a>Can the Minister say, therefore, whether TB and other conditions and their management are adequately included in the training of doctors in the UK? Indeed, would the forthcoming change of the Health Education Board mentioned in the document referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, which will be an issue for the House in months to come, encompass the proposal made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and other noble Lords today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="1012211000017"></a>The Government are deeply committed to issues of international development. In this year's spending review we confirmed that, as well as protecting the NHS budget, we will keep our promise to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on aid from 2013, helping the billion people who live in extreme poverty around the world. We are equally committed to doing everything we can to meet the millennium development goals. In particular, we are taking bold action to tackle malaria and to improve reproductive, maternal and newborn health. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, we are currently reviewing the previous Government's cross-Whitehall global health strategy to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in the coming years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="1012211000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, has linked issues of development with those of the appropriate education of health professionals, which itself has enormous implications both for our nation's health and for that of the rest of the world. As he knows, there are many aspects of the education of health professionals, encompassing pre- and post-registration training, as well as continued professional development. The responsibility for setting the standards required for professional pre-registration sits with the professional regulators. The higher education institutes then design training curricula to meet these standards in partnership with NHS service providers and the regulators. The Department of Health, along with the local NHS

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="1012211000019"></a>In terms of pre-registration education for doctors, we look to the General Medical Council for leadership. Its 2009 publication <I>Tomorrow's Doctors</I> provides the framework that UK medical schools use to design detailed curricula and methods of assessment. I was glad to see the framework was well received by the authors of the recent Lancet Commission publication, <I>Health Professionals for a New Century</I>. The framework also highlights the importance of a global dimension. New graduates must be able to demonstrate awareness, from a global perspective, of the determinants of health and disease and of the variations in healthcare delivery and medical practice. Postgraduate medical training curricula are developed by the medical royal colleges for approval by the GMC. Most of the topics highlighted in this debate are covered in the foundation programme curriculum and core competence framework for doctors developed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="1012211000020"></a>We have come a long way since the noble Lord wrote his report on medical training, <I>Global Health Partnerships</I>, in 2007. My noble friend Lord McColl is absolutely right that there is already significant good practice in the UK in terms of incorporating the global dimension into pre- and post-registration training. This is one part of the answer to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, who asked me to consider what more might be done to support this type of activity. Medical students can study global health; they can spend a year studying international health as part of an intercalated degree or can choose to travel to developing countries for the elective component of their undergraduate training. There are also opportunities for post-registration medical doctors to spend part of their specialty training in developing countries, as part of the out-of-programme training and research arrangements. Here, I reassure my noble friend Lady Tonge and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, that, if prospectively approved, training of this type counts towards the certificate of completion of training. Details of this initiative are provided in the <I>Gold Guide</I>, a guide for postgraduate specialty training in the UK agreed by the four UK health departments for core and/or specialty training programmes. This sets out a clear process as a guide for post-graduate deans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="1012211000027"></a>My noble friend Lord McColl stressed the need for taking longer periods overseas and providing greater support for achieving the goals that we have all been talking about. Universities support medical student electives as long as the plans are carefully drawn up to ensure the best possible experience for them and, of course, for the host institution abroad. I emphasise to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, lest there be any doubt in his mind, that we strongly support the principle that trainees should have opportunities to gain experience overseas both for their own benefit and that of the host countries. Also, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, was right to say that there are opportunities for postgraduate medical doctors to spend part of their specialty training in developing countries, as I have mentioned, and these can count towards clinical medical training.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="1012211000028"></a>In answer to my noble friend Lady Tonge, we take on board comments about reducing the level of bureaucracy in this process, and we welcome suggestions for improvement. However, we need to ensure both that service can continue to be delivered effectively in the NHS and that training overseas is appropriately recognised, supervised and assessed, which is not necessarily straightforward in every case.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="1012211000029"></a>Earlier this month, the Lancet Commission published a report, <I>Health Professionals for a New Century</I>. In response to some of its specific proposals, I should like to highlight the progress that has already been made in a number of areas. For example, the Department of Health is taking forward its technology-enhanced learning strategy to promote greater use of information technology for learning, harnessing and sharing global education resources. The Medical Training Initiative allows a small number of doctors from developing countries to work and train in the NHS before returning home. The National Leadership Council works with clinicians from all professions to develop their leadership skills and embed leadership across all undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The Health Partnership Scheme, launched in November by my honourable friend in another place, Stephen O'Brien, will enable NHS professionals to share their skills with nurses and doctors in developing countries through teaching, training and practical assistance. We should also mention the report from the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, entitled, <I>Women Doctors: </I><I>M</I><I>aking a </I><I>D</I><I>ifference</I>. It makes recommendations on a range of issues that include improving access to mentoring and career advice, improved access to childcare, more flexible and part-time training, and encouraging women into leadership positions.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="1012211000030"></a>We must always look to improve the standards of medical education in this country. For this reason, as has been mentioned, we have today published <I>Liber</I><I>ating the NHS: D</I><I>eveloping the </I><I>H</I><I>ealthcare </I><I>W</I><I>orkforce</I>, the consultation on the education and training aspects of the NHS White Paper, <I>Equity and Excellence: L</I><I>iberating the NHS</I>. The White Paper signals a new approach to workforce planning, education and training by,</p>
<ul><a name="1012211000071"></a>"giving employers greater autonomy and accountability for planning and developing the workforce",</ul>



<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_917"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 917</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="1012211000052"></a>alongside greater professional ownership of the quality of education and training. The consultation will enable my department to do the second thing proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, which is to meet with relevant parties to consider the findings of the Lancet Commission report. With the changes set out in the NHS and public health White Papers, the system of healthcare in England is changing, and it is imperative that our system of education and training reflects  that change.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="1012211000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, asked whether curricula include global competences. They do, and in acknowledgement of the case presented by Medsin UK, a global health dimension is included in the 2009 GMC guidance, <I>Tomorrow's Doctors</I>, which states that new graduates must be able to demonstrate,</p>
<ul><a name="1012211000072"></a>"an awareness from a global perspective of the determinants of health and disease, and variations in healthcare, delivery and medical practice".</ul>
<p><a name="1012211000053"></a>In fact, most of the topics highlighted by the report of the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, which I mentioned, are covered in the foundation programme curriculum published this year. All topics are at least partly described in the core competences for doctors in the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges' <I>Common Competences Framework for Doctors</I>, published last year.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="1012211000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, urged that we should find ways to give active support for doctors to take part in health partnership schemes. We agree that we need to support doctors and other health professionals to take part in that scheme and I can reassure him that the Department of Health is working closely with the Department for International Development on this initiative. I mentioned the partnership scheme earlier.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="1012211000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Butler, referred to the role of academic health science centres and I welcome the initiatives taken by the AHSCs, both in teaching and research, in global issues. They can contribute a huge amount but perhaps two things above all: the partnerships which they can and do form overseas and their ability to develop cultural competence in UK graduates.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="1012211000034"></a>My noble friend Lady Tonge referred to the need for ethical recruitment. She is absolutely right. She probably knows that the UK was the first country to produce international recruitment guidance based on ethical principles and the first to develop a robust code of practice for employers.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="1012211000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, made some extremely constructive and important points, as did all other speakers, for which I am very grateful. I shall make sure that these are taken into account during the consultation process.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="1012211000036"></a>In closing, I should like to take this opportunity to invite all interested parties to engage with the consultation to help us develop the recommendations made in the Lancet Commission report and to help shape the future system of education for health professionals.</p>

There are currently two conditions in the Bill: first, that there has been a yes vote in the referendum; and, secondly, in Clause 8(1)(b) that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012211000073"></a>"the draft of an Order in Council laid before Parliament under subsection (5A) of section 3 of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (substituted by section 10(6) below) has been submitted to Her Majesty in Council under section 4 of that Act".</ul>
<p><a name="1012211000054"></a>Without going into detail, that means that the constituency boundaries have been substantially redrawn in accordance with Part 2 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="1012211000038"></a>Our proposal seeks to ensure that, before there is any change in the voting system and any substantial redrawing of the boundaries, proper work is done to ensure that the electoral register is up to date. If that work is not done, you will end up with boundaries being in the wrong place. The electoral quota for the boundary review will be based on the date on which the review begins, according to the new rule in paragraph 9(2) of the new Schedule 2 to the 1986 Act.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="1012211000039"></a>On page 11 of the Bill, new paragraph 9(2), which is a new rule introduced by the Bill, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="1012211000064"></a>"The 'electorate' of the United Kingdom, or of a part of the United Kingdom or a constituency, is the total number of persons whose names appear on the relevant version of a register of parliamentary electors in respect of addresses in the United Kingdom, or in that part or that constituency. For this purpose the relevant version of a register is the version that is required by virtue of subsection (1) of section 13 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 to be published no later than the review date, or would be so required but for ... any power".</p>

<p><a name="1012211000055"></a>I do not think I need to read sub-paragraph (b). New paragraph 9(5) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="1012211000065"></a>"The 'review date', in relation to a report under section 3(1) of this Act that a Boundary Commission is required (by section 3(2)) to submit before a particular date, is two years and ten months before that date".</p>

<p><a name="1012211000056"></a>The effect of all those provisions is that the quota is to be calculated on the basis of the electoral register on the date when the review begins.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="1012211000040"></a>That plainly would not "take into account" underregistration in many areas of the UK. It is no good for the Government to say that they are interested in fair votes if the effect of what they are doing is to ignore the people who should be on the register but are not. The level of underregistration has been of

The redistribution of seats is dependent on the number of electors who are registered and does not take account of those missing from the register. Therefore, it is important to obtain as accurate an electorate as possible. The Boundary Commissions currently have only very limited powers to take other considerations into account, such as population projections, and the Bill requires them to use the registered electorate as the basis for Rule 2 calculations. That again is in new Schedule 2, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="1012211000066"></a>"The electorate of any constituency shall be ... no less than 95% of the United Kingdom electoral quota, and ... no more than 105% of that quota".</p>

<p><a name="1012211000057"></a>There is therefore scope to be 5 per cent above or 5 per cent below in working out how the electoral quota applies in a particular constituency.</p>

<p><a name="1012211000058"></a>and that the report contained,</p>
<ul><a name="1012211000075"></a>"a detailed analysis of the reasons for non-registration".</ul>
<p><a name="1012211000059"></a>The commission drew on a statistical register check carried out on its behalf by the Office for National Statistics. The report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="1012211000067"></a>"According to ONS, the best estimate for non-registration among the eligible household population in England and Wales at 15 October 2000 (the qualifying date for the February 2001 register) lies between 8% and 9%. This compares with 7-9% in 1991. This means that in the region of 3.5 million people across England and Wales were eligible to be on the register at their main residence but were missing from it in 2000".</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="1012211000042"></a>In the commission's first analysis of the performance of EROs in 2009, it noted the limited data available on the rates and number of people registering to vote and commissioned new research on the state of the electoral registers in Great Britain. <I>The </I><I>C</I><I>ompleteness and </I><I>A</I><I>ccuracy of </I><I>E</I><I>lectoral </I><I>R</I><I>egisters in Great Britain </I>was published in March 2010. Its key findings were as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="1012211000068"></a>"The completeness of Great Britain's electoral registers remains broadly similar to the levels achieved in comparative countries. However, national datasets and local case study research suggest there may be widening local and regional variations in registration levels. While there is no straightforward relationship between population density and the state of local registers, the lowest rates of completeness and accuracy were found in the two most densely populated case study areas, with the most mobile populations (Glasgow city and Lambeth). Recent social, economic and political changes appear to have resulted in a declining motivation to register to vote among specific social groups. This is despite the fact that electors now have more options than ever open to them to register. We made it as easy as it was possible to make for people to register. The annual canvass continues, on the whole to be an effective way to update the registration details of electors; but rolling registration, a tool introduced to maintain the register, has not prevented the completeness and accuracy of the registers declining between annual canvass periods. Under-registration and inaccuracy are closely associated with the social groups most likely to move home. Across the seven case study areas in phase two (therefore excluding Knowsley), under-registration is notably higher than average among 17-24 year olds (56% not registered), private sector tenants (49%) and black and minority ethnic (BME) British residents (31%). Each revised electoral register lasts for  12 months, from December to December; during that period, the

The research did not uncover electoral fraud in the case study areas. This may indicate that where instances of registration fraud or malpractice do occur they are likely to be relatively rare local incidents (although it may be difficult to determine instances of intentional over-registration using a survey approach). The research successfully tested new techniques which could help identify some forms of fraud. There is clearly scope to introduce measures locally which would improve the completeness and accuracy of specific registers. However, there are limits to what can be achieved nationally using the current registration system".</p>

<p><a name="1012211000043"></a>That is a summary of the Electoral Commission's conclusions.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="1012211000044"></a>According to data compiled by the Office of National Statistics and the House of Lords Library, for example, 24,000 voters are missing from the electoral register in Sheffield Central. In Portsmouth South, 20,000 eligible voters are missing, making a registration rate of 78 per cent. In Wimbledon, the figure is 80 per cent. That does not mean that 80 per cent are missing; it means that only 80 per cent of the people in Wimbledon who could vote are registered. That is 16,000 missing voters. In Colchester-I take these by way of example-missing voters stand at 14,500.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="1012211000069"></a>"It is young people, ethnic minorities, people living in private rented accommodation and those living in deprived areas which will be disproportionately affected by these changes".</p>

<p><a name="1012211000046"></a>What he said completely reflects the detailed conclusions of the Electoral Commission report, <I>The C</I><I>ompleteness and </I><I>A</I><I>ccuracy of </I><I>E</I><I>lectoral </I><I>R</I><I>egisters in Great </I><I>Britain</I>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="1012211000047"></a>If the Government plough ahead with their plans without addressing the state of the register, they will, in effect, be shutting the door on millions of eligible voters. I go back to the point that any suggestion about fairness should include fairness not just for those on the electoral register but for those who are not on the electoral register. When the previous Government were in power, we set the wheels in motion for increasing the number of eligible voters on the electoral register. We facilitated the introduction of individual voter registration but at a pace that sought to avoid the negative consequences of this when it was rolled out in Northern Ireland.</p>

Could they not check that  the people in the dwellings that they go to are on the electoral register? It seems an ideal time for advance publicity before the referendum planned in May. We have a census taking place at some time around March. I know there is always an argument about swapping information, but this is an ideal opportunity, particularly in the areas where it is known that there is under-registration. There is nothing new in what my noble and learned friend says: the same areas were under-registered 30 years ago. In those special areas an effort could be made by the enumerators to cross-check their results at the end of the day with the electoral register.</p>

Of course what I am saying is well known to everybody. However, he is wrong to say that the matter has remained static for 30 years. According to the ONS, the best estimate for non-registration among the eligible household population as at 15 October 2000 lies between 8 and 9 per cent. This compares with 7 to 9 per cent in 1991, so I think with respect that it is getting worse.</p>

Would he perhaps acknowledge the contribution of his noble friend Lord Wills, who was instrumental in improving the accuracy of the electoral register under the previous Labour Government, ensuring for example the provision of the rolling register, so that hundreds of thousands more voters were added to the register in April this year in order to vote in the general election? The system is now rather better than it has been previously, so the register as of 1 December this year will be more accurate than it was previously, and it is a good register on which to base the next Boundary Commission review-certainly better than it would have been otherwise and no different or worse than the previous five Boundary Commission reviews.</p>

Although the electoral register prepared in April indicated some improvements, the speech that I made earlier indicates the fundamental problems in relation to the register, which the Electoral Commission identified. I would be extremely surprised and concerned if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, departed from the position of the Electoral Commission in relation to that. Yes, we have made improvements, but there is still a long way to go, in particular in relation to the private rented sector, young people and black and minority ethnic groups. There is a very substantial group of people who are not on the electoral register but who could be if an effort was made.</p>

Eventually it should improve the accuracy of the register, but it will take some time in relation to it, and household registration tends to involve more people being registered than does individual registration. We introduced individual registration because we did not like the idea of it being the head of the household who determined whether or not you got registered. My noble friend Lord Beecham is right in saying that because that measure might reduce the number of people registered, the consequence is that you need more effort on the part of the electoral registration officers to ensure that things keep up. Ultimately, you cannot-if the claim is fairness-say that it is fairness in relation to this one aspect but not another.</p>

It would mean that the Government of the day had the highest possible motivation to ensure that there was proper registration and that the sorts of problems to which the Electoral Commission has referred would be dealt with.

First, however, I did not agree with what my own Government did in relation to changing the arrangements for registering for elections. I thought the head of the household system was far better than individual registration, and far more likely to ensure that more people were registered. I am worried about the effect that it will have when we move on to individual registration. I think that 17 or 18 year-olds are less likely to fill in forms, whereas the head of the household could ensure that all of the people of voting age were registered. I think it is a pity that we have moved in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="1012214000020"></a>However, the introduction of the rolling register, as the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, said, has significantly improved the situation.

Because the problems of under-registration were causing concern to MPs in Glasgow, they asked the leader of the council, councillor Gordon Matheson, to carry out an exercise of going around the city to see if people were not registered who ought to be. During the course of just a few months, nearly 36,000 extra voters were registered. That is an astonishing number. If that was carried out in every constituency, in every city, and in every county, then we would get a much more accurate picture of those people who are not now registered and who ought to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="1012214000023"></a>If it is too late, then we need to consider alternatives, but if it is not, we should be getting MPs to encourage councils to carry out this kind of exercise. Before my noble friend Lord Rooker raised it, I, too, had written down the question of the census. That is another opportunity to gather a more accurate picture of those who are eligible to vote. It would be helpful if, in his reply, the Minister would indicate whether it is possible to get the census enumerators, as they go around, to ask an additional question, about registration -the names of the people in the household over 18 or those who will attain the age of 18 by a particular date. They could hand forms out when they are going around, or leaflets. That is my order of preference-to get them registered and take a note of it, then to give them a form and, failing that, to give them a leaflet. That would help.</p>

I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, whom I have known for a very long time, will recognise the validity of the argument that if you are to have a fair election and fair boundaries, you need to ensure that everyone over the age of 18 is taken account of in drawing up those boundaries.</p>

What a good contribution, too, from my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer, and what an interesting intervention from the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. It is that last to which I want particularly to address my remarks. The noble Lord made a point that was completely impossible to dispute: in the past, constituency boundaries have been based on registers, registers by and large have been getting better-at least, we have worked on getting them better; we do not ever have a completely firm idea of how many people are not registered-and the Bill is therefore soundly based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="1012214000029"></a>That, however, is not reality. The reality is that with the Bill, for the first time, we are treating electorates as part of a rigid mathematical formula-5.1 per cent over, you have to be cut down; 5 per cent under, you have to cut back. There is a strict limit of 5 per cent within which the Electoral Commission has to work, and some good examples of the effects of that have been brought before noble Lords by outside advisers. But what we are trying to equalise is not some actual number, a number in reality-it is an extremely approximate guess at the number of electors. Yes, it is the number of people who appear on a list, but we have no idea how that relates in each individual constituency to the number of people who actually should be on that list.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="1012214000030"></a>I can guarantee that, under the provisions of the Bill, some seats will have bits cut off them because they are thought to be over the 5 per cent limit whereas in fact they are not; they will be well within the limit, but they will have a very high registration number. More importantly, you will have other seats which are having bits added into them. They have got a perfectly normal number of people living there but an inadequacy in the register means that they are not all counted. This is perfectly all right under the existing way in which the Electoral Commission works. It works in a way where size is only one of the factors it takes into account. It adjusts for such matters as natural boundaries, geography, local authority boundaries and so on, and it comes by and large to the most sensible view on the most sensible set of facts that are available to it. That does not work for a rigid mathematical formula of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="1012214000031"></a>Half of the solution to this should be to be less rigid about mathematical formulae, both in terms of allowing a greater flexibility around the size allowed to constituencies and by giving a greater weight to the other factors which the Electoral Commission can take into account when deciding the boundaries of a particular seat. We will come later to amendments which are designed to do both those things.</p>

No matter how allegedly better the registers are now, there must be a residual effect of the poll tax. So it may be better but there is a residual damage.</p>

Indeed it is not just the poll tax; there are a number of factors the whole time that cause people to avoid anything that identifies them individuals and which they think the authorities could catch up with. It may be for bad reasons: they may perhaps be illegally in the country or fear they are here illegally; or good reasons: that they fall for some of the liberal myths about the nature of the modern state and think that they may all end up in prison if they are identified. I do not take it by any means for granted that the improvement in the electoral register will continue over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="1012214000035"></a>It is rather like opinion polls. Opinion polls measure less and less because fewer and fewer people are willing to answer the questions because they are frightened that they may be held to task for the answers they give. There is therefore a serious risk of the deterioration of the electoral registers, which makes it all the more wrong that this Bill should have the exact number on the electoral register and the exact number of people in each constituency as its target and also makes it right that, in so far as we can improve these things at all, the amendment moved by my noble friend should be adopted to make them as good as they can be. But that will never be very good.</p>

Prior to the 2005 general election, when I was in the other place, my honourable friend Wayne David, my neighbouring colleague and MP for Caerphilly, and I were absolutely staggered to find that the new register had come out and our electorates had dropped by thousands-I think more than 8,000. We had a meeting with the electoral returning officer who was an official of his association and he explained to us that across the country electoral registration

Some were doing canvasses, some were sending out letters, some were sending out post cards and so on and so forth. The real top and tail of it was this: the council was simply not providing sufficient money for the electoral registration officer to carry out an annual canvass.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="1012214000037"></a>With the best will in the world, rolling registers have helped but they are more of a convenience. I do not think there is a great deal of evidence to show that many more people have actually registered. I am a bit concerned about individual registration-</p>

Does he not recall that in April-the month of the general election campaign-many hundreds of thousands of people, particularly young people, used this rolling register facility to register to vote in the general election? All the reasons why people do not wish to be on the register may apply in the future, while this year, because of the general election, many more people applied for inclusion on it. That is why 1 December might be a very good date on which to base the boundary review.</p>

Taking up the point of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, I am sure large numbers of people-large numbers of young people-registered. At the time of a general election, for reasons that could be national or local, people always speed up their registration. However, I am not entirely convinced that a rolling register will improve the total number of people registered. As I say, I am a little concerned that individual registration might deter people from registering. If it is to be done by a canvass but the whole family is not in the house, what will the canvasser do? Should he or she just take the names of one or two people and register them, while the other three-perhaps grown-up children-do not get registered?</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="1012214000041"></a>My point, coming back to my own experience, is that this simply will not improve registration. I appreciate that our economy and our country are in a difficult financial situation at present. However, registration will not improve unless central government provides the funding and directs local authorities to carry out an annual door-to-door canvass. In the past when we had such door-to-door canvasses, registration was, I believe, much higher. Unless we go back to that and provide the resources for it, it will not happen. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours made the point that the resources are lacking. My experience with my local council is simply that, with the best will in the world, it was not going to put in the resources necessary for an individual annual canvass. Unless we grasp that nettle, we will not improve the total number of people on the register.</p>

I spent hours on my feet in Committee on two pieces of legislation that went through under the Labour Government that introduced this monstrous piece of legislation on individual registration. It will be to our ultimate cost but that is an argument for another day. All I want to say is that I intervened in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton on the question of inner-city constituencies because there is a real problem developing here. Because of lack of registration and this national formula, we will end up with fewer inner-city seats but ones that have vast populations.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="1012214000043"></a>We must remember that inner-city seats involve far more work. I remember when I was the MP for Workington, comparing my constituency workload with that of some of the London MPs. They got three or four times the volume of mail that I did-so much so that they often simply could not provide the level of service that they wanted to in their inner-city seats. I thought I was being heavily pressured by constituents. One of the major problems in inner-city seats is to do with immigration, often involving groups of people who are not registered at all and who cannot register. That is in addition to the general problem of higher population. I simply do not believe that the Government have taken this whole matter into account. They say, "Oh well, local authorities can simply put the resources in", but they cannot. I say again that my own Government failed to ring-fence these budgets. However, if we had known that this legislation was coming, we might well have had to think more seriously about the need to ring-fence budgets in this area. In some ways we are now paying the price for not having done so. I invite Conservative Members to ring up some of the electoral registration officers that I have talked to, who complain that they simply will not be able to deliver on the Government's agenda in this area.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="1012214000044"></a>Finally, when we look at this debate it is important to consider what happens in rural Conservative seats with what I believe to be a far lower level of casework as against the position of city centre seats in London, Birmingham and Sheffield. We should actually consider the different workload. I think many Conservative Members simply do not understand the weight of additional work that arises in those constituencies. I cannot see any way around it. There is nothing in this legislation that is there to help; we have had no undertakings from the Dispatch Box that we are going to get over this problem. My noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton has repeatedly raised this question of higher populations in inner city seats and we have heard nothing from the Government. As this Bill progresses through Committee I think we are going to find that a lot of our debate revolves around that particular issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="1012214000046"></a>Perhaps it will not come as any surprise to your Lordships' House that we cannot accept that there should be a further condition. We are not quite sure what "substantially up to date" means and, quite frankly, no case has been made as to why it should be done with regard to setting this order in motion as opposed to the fundamentally important point-on which I would substantially agree with what has been said not only by the noble and learned Lord but by other contributors-of getting a more accurate electorate. Indeed, I would say that even if there were a no vote in the referendum it should not in any way diminish the wish and the objective of trying to ensure that the electoral register is made as accurate as it possibly can be. It is important that it should be as up to date as possible but I do not believe it should be a condition of the commencement of the AV provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="1012214000047"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the electoral registration officers across local authorities in the United Kingdom already have a statutory duty to take the steps that are necessary to maintain the registers and the commission has a statutory responsibility to promote public awareness of electoral registration and elections and to set and monitor performance standards and electoral services. It is worth noting that the report to which the noble and learned Lord referred, <I>The C</I><I>ompleteness and </I><I>Accuracy of E</I><I>lectoral </I><I>R</I><I>egisters in Great Britain</I>, published in March this year, reported a registration rate in the United Kingdom of 91 to 92 per cent. That compares reasonably well with other countries. Furthermore, the commission's report, <I>Performance Standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain</I>, also published in March, showed that just under 96 per cent of electoral registration officers met the completeness and accuracy of electoral registration records standard this year, a considerable improvement on the previous occasion.</p>

It is constituency sizes that you are trying to equalise on the basis of these registration figures, and 91 per cent overall could easily hide a difference between 80 per cent at the lowest and 99 per cent at the highest.</p>

That is why we are taking forward and progressing towards individual registration. I know that the noble and learned Lord agreed that we were taking along what had been set in motion by the previous Administration, although I understand that there are disputes about that on his own Back Benches. In addition, we are introducing measures such as data-matching schemes to help local authorities gain as complete a picture as possible of eligible voters in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="10122113000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, made reference to the census. It was a helpful suggestion. In a previous incarnation in Scotland, I had some ministerial responsibility for the census, and I am only too aware of the sensitivities attached  to that. I rather suspect that the Office for National Statistics has thought about the degree to which it would be practical to mix the census with another exercise and the effects that that could have. I do  not have the information to hand on whether the ONS has made that analysis, but I would nevertheless be happy to look into that issue. It might also be possible, although I cannot give any definitive answer, for  the information from the census to inform us in the  future. As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, indicated, there are sensitivities about data protection, but  perhaps it may be possible for that information to be available for informing further efforts to improve voter registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="10122113000010"></a>I confirm that we are piloting data matching between electoral registration officers and public authorities to identify people who are not on the register and target them for registration. We have just run a process for applications and the pilots will occur next year. I say to the noble and learned Lord that the boundaries have always been drawn on the basis of the register, and, as he correctly pointed out, the review date will be in two years and 10 months. As the report is due on 1 October 2013, the review date would be 1 December which has just passed, which, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, would be too late. However, I hope he will agree that it is not too late to try to encourage people to get on to the register for the purpose of voting in the referendum and in the other elections which are due to take place next year.</p>

I also point out that, under the Bill, we are seeking to have a review every five years. That would allow us the opportunity every five years to improve and, it is hoped, to take advantage of the improvements to which we are committed and which I know the Administration of which he was a member subsequently supported. My noble friend Lord Rennard paid proper tribute to the work that was done by the previous Administration to try to increase voter registration with a rolling register. These are worthwhile initiatives and we want to continue with them.</p>

I have not noted his precise words on this but he also accepted that it is an important issue because it effectively disenfranchises the groups on which I think we agree-that is, those in the private rented sector, those in the BME community and young people.

My understanding is that it is a common provision in the context of a power to commence primary legislative provisions by order.

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="10122113000027"></a>The Government take the view that there is only one situation in which the power would need to be used: a case where a by-election is called after the AV provisions are implemented but before the first general election to be held on the alternative vote. That situation could arise if it was thought beneficial to commence the AV provisions well in advance of the anticipated next general election. We would wish to do that to give electoral administrators some certainty. In those circumstances, the power would be used to ensure that such a by-election would be held on the basis of first past the post because provision along these lines would ensure that all Members of the other place should be elected using the same electoral system. I hope no one would disagree with that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="10122113000028"></a>The noble Lord has raised the point. The Government take the view that the best approach therefore is to remove the power in Clause 8(4) and instead provide explicitly for the situation as regards the elections prior to the first general election on AV. That makes the Government's intention very clear and removes any room for doubt about how that power might be used. The effect of Amendment 47 on its own would be undesirable. It would remove any power to make the saving provision that we think is sensible in secondary legislation without placing that saving provision in the Bill in its place. It would certainly be our intention to bring forward an appropriate amendment on Report.</p>

I want to address my remarks primarily to them during the course of this debate. Clause 8 deals with actions that the Government must take following the result of the referendum, a referendum that is based on a simple majority. A simple majority vote is what the Government argue is their way of respecting the will of the people. I quote those words "respecting the will of the people" because they were the words that the noble Lord,

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="10122113000031"></a>I go back to 13 per cent. That is hardly what I would call the will of the people. I would argue that that not being the will of the people, the Government should-the Bill says "must"-take certain actions in this clause. I would argue that they should not take those actions. I argue that that 13 per cent figure is particularly relevant-we are back, essentially, to a threshold debate-because last week I had conversations with various electoral registration officers in the north-west of England, and from the conclusions that I drew as  a result of those debates it is quite obvious that when the referendum takes place in various parts of the country next year, there will be some very low turnouts indeed. I cite the case of Manchester City Council because its elections in 2007 broadly reflect the results coming from a stream of cities in the north-west of England. Liverpool, Burnley, Preston and all the cities around that area broadly had the same turnouts in their local election campaigns. I will refer to a return that was sent to me by Manchester City Council for the elections in 2007.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="10122113000032"></a>The relevance of this to the Cross-Benchers is this; I believe that most Cross-Benchers have had no experience whatever of turnouts in elections. The closest that most Cross-Benchers in this House will ever have been to an election is voting in one. They will never have canvassed, they will never have been members of political parties, and their knowledge of these matters will be very small indeed. I draw the Cross-Benchers' attention to some turnout figures so that when they read the record of the debate, they will understand what happens in these inner city seats-seats that will form part of the national results. It takes only 50.1 per cent of the return in these seats actually to win the referendum.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="10122113000033"></a>I will not name the seats in Manchester, but I will go through some of the turnouts: 24 per cent, 21 per cent, 23 per cent, 22 per cent, 27 per cent, 16 per cent, 29 per cent, 28 per cent, 21 per cent, 27 per cent, 20 per cent, 29 per cent and 17 per cent. Let us remember that it needs only half of these turnouts in terms of cast votes to decide in favour. They will in effect approve the biggest constitutional question, in what I think were the words of Mr Clegg, for the last 180 years. I shall go on: 24 per cent, 29 per cent, 25 per cent,  21 per cent, 21 per cent, 21 per cent, making an average of 27 per cent. Those are very low turnouts indeed. I cannot see how it is possible to justify changing the law on such a major constitutional issue on the basis of low turnouts on this scale.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="10122113000034"></a>If I translate those turnouts into the votes that are actually required in Manchester City, a city of a third of a million people, on an average turnout of 27.7 per cent you need only 13.85 per cent of the electorate to approve the referendum. It means that the votes alone of 42,580 people in Manchester, a city of a third of a million people, would determine the result of whether people were in favour of the change in our electoral arrangements to AV. I do not believe that 42,000 out of a third of a million people in Manchester could in anyone's language be described as the will of the people being exercised in the way suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. It is far too low a figure.</p>

Despite what was said in the House of Commons, the reality is that this matter was hardly debated at the other end. There was no great debate because of the way House of Commons business is conducted these days. I hope that the statistics I have produced will get through to those whose judgment may be influenced.</p>

In my submission, there are two things that one needs to focus on. First, it is to be a compulsory referendum in the sense that the Minister is required to introduce the new AV system without any protection against a low turnout. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said that we would trust the view of the people in that respect, but the difficulty about that is that he did not address the argument put repeatedly and effectively that where you are dealing with significant constitutional change, most systems, including ours, build in protections against change that does not have adequate political and popular support.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="10122113000037"></a>This is a constitutional change that does not have the support of Parliament or, as my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours said in the course of the debate, that of any political party. I therefore ask the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, to address the fact that in this way you could have constitutional change that is supported by 13 per cent of the population but is not supported by Parliament or by any political party. Most people would regard that kind of change as easier than normal legislative change, so will the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, address the argument by saying more than simply, "We trust the will of the people."? Some thought must have been given to that matter. He looks bewildered-as he often does in relation to the Bill-but if he can do no better than that, the House will draw its own conclusions. If his argument is no better than that, he should say so.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="10122113000038"></a>The second point about this provision is that the coalition has decided that before AV is introduced the constituencies should be equalised. This is presumably because it takes the view that it would be unfair to have a new electoral system if there is unfairness in the size of constituencies. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has made the point that they are trying to achieve fairness. However, it is obvious that, as the majority of constituencies in this country will be redrawn, it will be unfair to constituencies if they are redrawn on an inaccurate electoral register.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is nodding sagely and I express our gratitude, on behalf of the nation, for his openness in providing that information. The information repays looking at. Take the north-east of England, for example. In the City of

In Manchester Central, 11,820 people are not registered in a constituency in which 78,000 people are registered; in Bradford West, 15,885 people over 18 are not registered in a constituency of approximately 65,000; in Sheffield Central, 60,000 people are registered and approximately 24,000 are not registered; in Leeds North West, approximately 68,000 people are registered and 17,528 are not.

My noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton requested the figures for England; I have asked in a Written Question for the same figures for Scotland, so that I may make the same comparisons.

After five years working with civil servants, I am always very cautious about putting total faith in their drafting, but no doubt Ministers think otherwise.</p>

It is not perfect in any way, but it has two democratically elected chambers-the House of Representatives and the Senate-the President taking part in terms of legislation, while the Supreme Court provides an opportunity to consider whether there is anything that infringes the constitution of the United States. We do not have those checks and balances here; we are rushing the Bill through.</p>

It provides for a referendum on a voting system. If the answer is yes, it should apply at the next general election and there should be fewer MPs and different boundaries. That simplicity should be able to unite us all. Yet in the words of the noble and learned Lord, I am utterly bewildered by the arguments put forward by noble Lords opposite. They complain that there might be a low turnout yet they support amendments that are likely to make the turnout lower by not having the referendum on 5 May. My position is at least as arguable as the noble Lord's.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="10122113000058"></a>The noble and learned Lord said, "Don't argue. We should trust the people". I think "trust the people" is one of the most important and significant labels that we have in this country and indeed in western democracy. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, prayed in aid the western foundation for democracy. What is the western foundation for democracy if it is not to trust the people? Yet with every single amendment noble Lords are saying, "Don't trust the people. They may not come out and vote. If they do come out and vote and they say yes they are probably wrong. Only we can decide". What is even more bewildering is that the Labour Party voted one way in the House of Commons and another in this House. No wonder I am bewildered. What is happening is bewildering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="10122113000059"></a>The charge is that we are bulldozing this Bill through, but we are about to start the seventh day in Committee and we have not yet agreed Clause 8. The House of Commons dealt with the Bill in five days in Committee. It had significant votes on every single aspect of the Bill at some stage. The Bill has been given more time and more consideration in both Houses than most of the Bills produced in the past 13 years.</p>

Not only did they complain about the lack of time, they also produced evidence from Conservative councils about lack of time. Does he also understand the crucial point here is that this is  a constitutional Bill? We have a situation where a Government are changing the composition in terms of numbers of the House of Commons without either an independent assessment first or the agreement of all the parties. That is what makes the Bill much more serious than he is pretending at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="10122113000066"></a>It is widely known what this clause does. It provides for when the alternative vote provisions will either take effect or be repealed, and it is carefully worked out what all the provisions do. Subsection (2) provides that if there are not more yes votes than no votes in the referendum, the Minister must make an order repealing the alternative vote provisions. The two policies are included in this Bill because they are both crucial issues relating to how people are elected to the other place. This referendum will, for the first time, give voters a say in how they elect their MPs and the boundary proposals will mean fairer and more equal constituency boundaries can be put in place for a general election in 2015. Both these policies went through another place with clear majorities, and I very much hope that this clause will stand part.</p>

It simply tweaks the supplementary vote system whereby, instead of using two Xs, it requires the use of numbering of first and second preferences on the ballot paper. I have tabled it as a probing amendment to establish whether the Government accept that my wording meets the high standards of legislative language that the law would require if the Bill were passed with those words included within it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="10122113000075"></a>A fair criticism of my amendment is that it reflects my unyielding persistence in belief in, and pursuit of, a credible electoral system as an alternative to first past the post. That is true, because I remain deeply concerned about the system which the Government have used, the Queensland AV system-the optional multipreference voting system. The advantage of this proposal is that while it might look like the supplementary vote, it is not a classic supplementary vote. You can call it the alternative vote. It gets around the language references to AV already embodied in the Bill. For those who have not been present during the course of our many references to SV and to how the system would work, for ease of reference, I refer them to col. 194 of House of Lords <I>Hansard</I> of 8 December. I would be ill-advised at this time of the evening once again to set out the case for my proposed system. However, I would refer the House to the contributions of Mr Christopher Chope, the Member for, I think, Chichester or Chislehurst.</p>

It goes back to the question as to what is the best AV system to use. The Government have made a choice as to what they think is the best AV system, which is one where you have the right to use a number of preferences, but you do not have to use them all. The second option is the one used in the federal system in Australia where you have to use them all and the third option is the one used in London which is where you identify the top two candidates from first preferences and then you divide all the second preferences from the other candidates between those two candidates. As I read the group-although the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is shaking his head-it seeks to put in those two systems.</p>

These are the questions for the Government. It might not necessarily be in the form or in the shape that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, put it, but as an alternative that the Government can select, after a proper consultation. Ultimately, one way of dealing with this issue would be for there to be a simple referendum on replacing first past the post with AV. Assuming that there was a yes vote-ignore the complications that we talked about earlier on-choosing which of the three systems was best could be done by the Government. There could still be compulsion in introducing AV, but there could be a proper debate with the public and in Parliament as to which is the best system, rather than the way it is done at the moment, which is that the Government have selected a particular system of AV, about which there has been no consultation and no explanation to the public. There are two questions. First, is the drafting right? Secondly, why not incorporate in the Bill the three options and allow Parliament to decide after a public consultation which is the best?</p>

I was rather amazed to have had an impact with my previous amendment and I very much hope that the Government will be able to accept this one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="10122113000091"></a>It is a perfectly simple amendment. It does not go to the heart of the Bill, the core of the coalition agreement or anything like that. It simply says that if someone marks just one preference when they go into the polling booth and, instead of putting 1, they mark it X, that should count. I do not want to labour the point because I see the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, nodding encouragingly. We are in agreement on a lot of things here-we want the maximum number of valid votes in the referendum, as does he-so it is good from that point of view.</p>

Those of us who have been in the other place-that is, those who have been to an election count, and I do not know whether my noble friend has-know that, under the present first-past-the-post system, if someone puts a 1 against a candidate, that counts as a vote because it is a clear indication. So it is bound to be the case under AV that if you put an X against a name, it will count as a vote; the normal rules allow for that.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="10122113000093"></a>I thought that the idea of this was to persuade people to use second choices. This is where the con comes in of it being the "optional" AV system. There will be a campaign out there of people saying, "You don't have to bother with all these numbers-just put an X against my name". That is what it is all about. The argument that AV gets rid of tactical voting is fraudulent, as I hope my noble friend will admit.</p>

In the Bill as drafted an X would not count, and under the amendment that I would like to make an X would count. I must say an X is about the only bit of our electoral system that is truly traditional. It goes way back to the times when many people could not write numbers. First past the post is not the only system that has been in use in Britain. If you look back to the last century there were the university seats and two-member seats in the cities. Nothing else is traditional except the use of X. I am here in the guise of a traditionalist trying to preserve the tradition of the X. The final thing I would say is that, although most people have no difficulty with 1, 2 and 3, older voters and others have perhaps become accustomed to a certain way of casting their vote, and I do not think there is any need to force them to change their mind if they just want to put an X in the right place.</p>

It does seem to be eminently sensible in that people have been putting Xs on ballot papers for a very long time and it is conceivable that they might continue to do so. I am not totally reassured by the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that there is all this flexibility among returning officers. You might not find that this flexibility is there. I would be more comfortable if this was in the Bill and it was made absolutely clear that an X was just as valid as a 1 and vice versa. This is a very sensible amendment which all sides of the House should feel very comfortable about supporting.</p>

It completely undermines the intention behind those who are pursuing this legislation and indeed this system. It defeats the objective. If all the elector has to do is put a cross on the ballot paper, under this system it will invite precisely what has happened in Australia, which was referred to in that article by Rallings and Thrasher which I drew to the attention of the House a couple of weeks ago. They talk in Australia about people plumping. If you allow people just to use an X on the ballot paper, as my noble friend has said, canvassers-in particular Liberal Democrat canvassers, who are always masters of tactical voting-will go from door to door saying, "Don't worry, don't bother, we know it's complicated. All you have got to do is put an X against the candidate you want", completely undermining the system. I am surprised my noble friend did not see this problem inherent in the system when he decided to move this amendment. I do hope that the Government do not fall for this one, because if they do and then say that they have started to be flexible by giving way on amendments, that is not the kind of flexibility-</p>

At all the counts that I have been to, where an X was not used-perhaps a 1, a tick or a signature was used-the votes are counted as doubtful. The candidates and the agents gather round as the returning officer goes through the count of the doubtful votes saying, "Yes, that is accepted" or "No, that is rejected", and so on. Does that sound familiar to those others who have been candidates? It was certainly my experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="10122115000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is making it absolutely clear that if in this election an X is put on the ballot paper, it should count. It is then beyond peradventure or doubt. It is a clear indication of preference. I might have suggested some other indications of preference, such as a tick or some other indication that the candidate who has the mark next to their name-it could be  a cross, a tick or another positive mark, as well as a 1-is the person chosen. I have the greatest admiration for my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. He and  I have been friends since we were elected together all those years ago and we have worked closely together.  I say to him that I do not think it would be the Liberal Democrats but the Tories and us who would go around saying, "Put an X next to our man", or, as an old friend of mine used to say, "Just put a kiss next to the guy you like". That is a little old fashioned, although I see the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, likes the thought of it, which gives me some encouragement. I would certainly support it. This reminds me of the old story about people who would come in and sign an X when you said, "Would you sign here?". I knew someone who put two Xs. I said, "Wait a minute. What's the second X for?". He said, "Oh, that's my PhD".</p>

X has been around for a long time-not just in current elections or the past century's elections. The amendment means that if we allowed people to put an X and everyone knew that, the various people who put ticks, 1s, kisses, sweethearts and all that sort of thing would then know that putting an X is a recognised way of voting. My noble friend is absolutely right about people not being able to read and write. I have my grandfather's wedding certificate-or his wedding lines, as they are called in Scotland. It says, "Bernard McAvoy: his mark here". The mark is an X. If it was good enough for him, it will be good enough for me and my noble friend.</p>

I do not quite follow the point of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. Presumably a candidate could just go around inviting supporters to put a 1 beside their name and leave it at that. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is being a modern-day Viscount Simon of Glaisdale, whom I remember opposing amendments that had been introduced for the avoidance of doubt on the grounds that there was no doubt to be avoided in the first place. However, in this case the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has raised an appropriate doubt that reflects people's experiences. The amendment would be extremely valuable for that purpose. There is one

Particularly if it is a transitional period, many voters who have not got used to the new system might put an X against a name. If there are a large number of those, it would undermine the legitimacy of the system if all those votes were then discarded.</p>

I did not realise how serious my noble friend was about his amendment. I know he supports AV, which I do not; I support PR. It is not our job to sow confusion in the ballot system, which is what this amendment would do. The Electoral Commission will spend a fortune distributing leaflets to every dwelling, informing the voters about the change in the system. They will not be talking about using Xs. I gave the example from my own experience. As every ex-Member of Parliament will know from being at a count, it is the indication of a candidate by the voter that counts. The officers have a whole list of charts, showing what you can put on a ballot paper, what counts and what does not. That is how you get your spoilt votes. Not every vote is like it is. The public do not understand this but the system works and I have every confidence in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="10122115000012"></a>What if the voters put an X against one and, because of all the publicity that has gone on, they put a 2 against someone else? How do you know the X is a 1 in that case? Only an X alone on the ballot paper would indicate a preference for a candidate. That, however, is the very antithesis of what we are trying to do with the alternative vote; it is not my preferred choice but it is a choice against first past the post. I ask the Government not to put this amendment in the Bill because custom and practice dictates, with returning officers, that the vote would count. This would actually sow confusion. Are we going to send back to the other place a Bill that we got from them and say, "By the way, we want you to use Xs."? Come on, that is absolutely preposterous.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="10122115000092"></a>"A voter votes by marking the ballot paper with ... the number 1 opposite the name of the candidate who is the voter's first preference",</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="10122115000018"></a>I understand that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is designed to deal with the situation in which there is only one X on the ballot paper. There is no X, 2, 3 or 4, nor is there X against more than one name. Under the amendment, it would not be possible to count that as a vote in favour or a first preference for the person against whom the X is granted. You would need to be an idiot not to believe that the X against one name and one name only is the first preference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="10122115000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who is an expert in all matters, says that it is perfectly obvious that the returning officer would treat that as voting for your first preference. Well, that would not be consistent with Clause 9(1); I do not have the noble Lord's experience to know how returning officers might deal with it, but I suspect that some would deal with it in some way and some would deal with it in another way. It seems right that if you put an X against only one name, as your intention is so clear the right course for the Bill is that it should reflect that course. I do not think that the drafting of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, quite achieves what he wants because it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="10122115000093"></a>"Where a voter marks a ballot with a cross against the name of a candidate, that cross shall count as if the voter had placed the number 1 opposite the name of that candidate".</p>

<p><a name="10122115000088"></a>That does not deal with the situation in which he has X against more than one name or with the situation in which he has put X, 2, 3, 4 or 5, but this is Committee and the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, was absolutely clear. It was understood by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom, by me and by everyone else in a particular way. I do not accept the actual drafting but I strongly support the intention behind the amendment. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

There was a suggestion that in such cases, far from wanting a candidate, the voter did not want them. Those are circumstances where it would be invidious to suggest what would happen. Certainly when an X is marked against a name, it is clear from the provision in the Bill that the vote would be valid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="10122115000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is concerned -and I understand his concern-that this might lead to undermining the system. I think it was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, who indicated that if there was a yes vote in the referendum, in the run-up to a general election in 2015 there would be advertising making the position clear. There were indications that that actually happened in the Scottish elections where a single transferrable vote requiring numbered preferences was used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="10122115000032"></a>The night is drawing on but perhaps I may relate one small anecdote. I stood in the first ever European election in the south of Scotland and I have the dubious distinction of being the first person ever to lose their deposit in a European election. I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Alderdice will recall that the 1979 European elections in Northern Ireland were carried out on the basis of the single transferable vote, whereas in the rest of the United Kingdom they were carried out on the basis of first past the post. A corner of Galloway in the south of Scotland received Ulster TV, on which the advertising encouraged people to use their vote by marking 1, 2 and 3. In several polling stations in that part of Galloway a number of ballot papers were marked with a 1, 2 and 3, although the election was on the basis of first past the post. However, there was agreement that the number 1 on a ballot paper would be accepted as a valid vote.</p>

<a name="101220-0003.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="10122115000033"></a>Let us not underestimate the voters. There will be ample advertising to indicate that the nature of the election will be a preferential vote system. I do not believe that that will undermine the election or that it will give rise to the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

A helpful way forward-I suggest this to the Minister with due humility-might be if the Association of Electoral Administrators were to write to him and he made available to the House a statement saying that the association would interpret the Bill as it stands with those two provisions in the way that he has suggested they should be interpreted-namely, that a mark against one candidate will be accepted. If he were able to make that small concession, I would happily drop this amendment and not resurrect it on Report.</p>

On balance it looks like you are giving two votes to voters who choose the least popular candidate. You are not giving two votes to the voter who chooses the most popular candidate, or the second most popular candidate, but the voter who chooses the least popular candidate is effectively given two votes.</p>

Why should someone have two votes? It is clear that the alternative vote can be used to ensure that every voter can influence the results in a way that is not possible under first past the post. I freely accept that it can be used. Under this Bill, however, it is not possible to claim that every voter will be able to do it because it is an optional system. You still have the problem of what you do at the end with the vote that gets transferred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="10122115000050"></a>Why should the second vote of the person who has voted for the least popular candidate have the same value as the first vote? This is not original; I read it in some academic text somewhere, although I cannot remember where and I have not been able to go back to it. In my view it is quite simple: why should it have the same value? Why not put the value on it that the voter, or the voters as a whole, created for that candidate? So, if you have five candidates-one, two, three, four, five-and the fifth one is coming out, the second preferences for that candidate are worth a fifth of a vote to whoever they have chosen among the others. If there are only four candidates, you give them a quarter of the vote. If there are eight or nine candidates, and the bottom one finishes ninth, then the second preference is worth a ninth of a vote to the candidate that they have chosen for it. That to me seems fair. You are not giving people two votes, which is what you are effectively doing under the present system, but you are giving them the vote in proportion-that word might not go down too well here at the moment-to where they came on the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="10122115000051"></a>I think that has a fairness appeal to it. It is much fairer than giving people two votes. It seems obvious, it is fair, it is practical and it avoids the central criticisms levelled against the alternative vote, leaving aside whether it is compulsory to use all your preferences or not. One of the central criticisms of it is-let us put names on it-if the BNP candidate comes at the bottom. We may have a view about people who want to put the BNP candidate as their first choice, but why should those people's second choice have the same value as their first choice? It does not really matter who came bottom, but that is the reality we are coming to. That is a very serious criticism against the alternative vote. It was made by Churchill, it was quoted in this House and I think it has some value. So let us do something about it.</p>

That is all. In that case, it might take a little bit longer. I know someone is going to say, "Oh, we can't have decimal points on the vote". Why not? We can count. People understand decimal points. Talking about voters not understanding things, I had people who could not write, but they could fill in a full perm on a football coupon though, and the women could read a knitting pattern, so do not talk to me about people not understanding. They understand the value whether it has a decimal point or not. It is either worth more or worth less. It is fair and very simple, and I offer it at this point in time-23.17. I do not mind when it comes into play. I would like to have some really good arguments about why we should not do this because basically, as is known, I prefer a PR system However, I am trying to make this present system, if this is what is going to be driven through by Parliament-I do not say that pejoratively-fairer to the voter and easier to explain in those television studios when you are on the third degree. I can say one thing for sure: this referendum will not be as popular in the television studios as Mr Clegg was in those first question and answer sessions. The heat will be on and they will be taking apart the system, looking at the nitty-gritty, looking at all the contradictions about what can happen with an optional AV system, which we have explored here over the past six days. The central criticism is the one about the second preference for the least-popular candidate, so let us not give them a full vote. Let us give them the vote where they came on the ballot paper. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="10122115000056"></a>Alex Salmond was allowed to put himself at the top of each ballot paper-"Alex Salmond for First Minister". The situation in Scotland was that the SNP did not win the election. Thanks to the daft list system, it finished up with one MSP more than the Labour Party, which allowed it to claim under a convoluted and twisted voting system that it had somehow won the right for Mr Salmond to be First Minister. Not satisfied with that, in the 2004 election the Labour Party made the mistake of indulging its Liberal partners in the coalition-what was a genuine coalition in Scotland, not a collaboration like we have at the moment. They were on opposite sides of the Chamber. But the Labour Party allowed itself to be blackmailed, cajoled-call it what you like. Almost within hours of the election result, the Labour Party at Holyrood had caved in and given the Liberals PR for local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="10122115000057"></a>They have still got that system until it is changed. The candidates are listed in alphabetical order. My understanding of it is tangled because I kept back from Holyrood. I did not particularly want to get involved in MSP matters, but it affected the political party I am committed to. As far as I can recall-again the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, will correct me if I am wrong-the Liberals and others, mainly the SNP, blocked the situation whereby there was a suggestion that the political candidates should be put into alphabetical order within party blocks on the ballot paper. I accept that I am vague on this but I blame the Liberals for everything else so I might as well blame them for this. Folk looked at the paper and said, "There is the Labour candidate and that is the Liberal candidate, so that is who I am going to vote for", instead of starting at the top alphabetically. The debacle of 2007 was confusing. It was caused by exactly the same proponents of systems rather than democracy and appealing to people.</p>

She was an outstanding candidate, but she had the unfortunate handicap that her surname began with the letter "O". She was at the bottom of the ballot paper and she lost her seat. Even the local Liberals felt guilty, which was quite an unusual occurrence. They said to her that they were sorry that she was the one to lose out to the system. What happened was that the Labour Party won two of the three seats in that ward. The Labour candidate who won was a new candidate in the area, a good councillor in his former area, and he is now a good councillor in his current area. But he ended up with almost double the votes that the poor candidate with the surname starting with "O" got, and therefore she lost out to, I think, the SNP candidate, who has also turned out to be a good ward councillor.</p>

They may well be votes for the BNP or for an extremist party, but it is wrong that in some cases the outcome should be determined by the second preferences of  the bottom candidate. The system put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for addressing this by weighting the votes according to where they come on the list seems a logical answer.

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="10122115000064"></a>I wish to ask my noble friend whether there might be a slight difference between what we were working on and what he was working on. When he moved the amendment, he referred to the value given to these additional preferences being based on the position on the ballot paper. I presume he meant that if a candidate was in seventh position and yet was the third preference of a particular elector, they would have only one-seventh of the value, whereas under the system on which we worked in 1989 they would have one-third of the value. Can my noble friend clarify the position? If he is working on the basis that there are seven candidates and the candidate at the bottom-candidate Peter-is the third preference of the voter but gets one-seventh of the vote for the third preference, I would not be altogether in favour of it. But if it is simply his

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="10122115000065"></a>I understand that a number of academics have also worked on AV and supplementary vote systems since 1989 to establish whether weighting votes in this way would work. The only problem that arises if one does that is that the minority candidates-in this case, the Liberal Democrats say that they would gain more seats under AV-would not gain as many seats. Although AV tends only marginally to be more proportional-it some circumstances, it can be considerably more so-the effect of weighting votes in the way being suggested will be to reduce the likelihood of outsider candidates winning seats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="10122115000066"></a>My noble friend Lord McAvoy was worried about the anoraks. I apologise to him for being one of those rather pathetic creatures, but electoral systems is a particularly interesting subject. It is the sort of thing you go to bed at night thinking about. I welcome the amendment moved by my noble friend and look forward to the response of the Minister.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, I am a great believer in the first past the post system. It may not be perfect, but I suspect that it is rather better than any other system that anybody might like to introduce. Having said that, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has to be right. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lamont that, if you want a fairer system, you should do something to make sure that everybody's second votes under an alternative vote system do not all count for the same and that they are graded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="10122115000068"></a>The problem is that, in its wisdom, the House has decided that we should hold the referendum on the same day as the local elections. I have argued in previous debates that it does not give us a very good opportunity to explain to the country an extremely complex change in our voting system when we are trying to hold local elections and elections for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly at the same time. I hate to say it to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, but to try to explain his even more complex way of doing the alternative vote would take even longer. I suggest that, before we even entertain the idea, we agree that the vote should be held on a different day.  I was quite relaxed about the referendum being held, let us say, a month after the local authority elections. If we are going to go down the path suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, perhaps we need an even bigger gap between the local elections and the referendum, because an awful lot of explaining of this major change in our electoral system will have to be done to the country.</p>

I am convinced that it will be extremely difficult to explain to the country what the AV vote is about. If it is held on the same day as the local elections and all the other elections, it will be virtually impossible. People will not understand the implications of any different voting system if we stick it in on the same day as the local elections. However, that is what the House has decided to do, in its wisdom, and we are therefore in a very difficult situation, making the whole business of what the vote is even more complicated than it was already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="10122115000073"></a>It takes me back to the days, the happy days indeed, when I was sitting on the Jenkins committee. We got many, many proposals on the Jenkins committee for various systems of weighted voting. D'Hondt as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, with his great knowledge of these matters surely knows, is not a weighted voting system. All the many proposals on weighted voting systems had one factor in common; they were invariably written in green ink and therefore we on the commission did not have to spend as long considering them as we might otherwise.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="10122115000074"></a>There are two reasons of substance why this amendment should be rejected. The first is that Churchill's neat phrase does not reflect the reality in many voters' minds. It is not true that the most important choice for voters is who they put first and who they put second and they do not care who they put sixth and who they put seventh. If you take my case, in a constituency where there were some serious candidates and towards the bottom of the ones with a chance there was the Democratic Socialist Crosland Labour-affiliated candidate and, on the other hand, the British National Party candidate. I would feel extremely strongly that I preferred the first of those options, whatever I was doing further

In reality, there is no way of measuring the strength of people's preferences, or the amount of thought they have put into them, and it is therefore better to treat all preferences, as AV does, as of equal weight.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="10122115000075"></a>The second argument has been touched on and it concerns complexity.</p>

In my own constituency of Brecon and Radnor, there are very real choices to be made, due to the fact that the Labour candidate, alas, is not a front-running candidate in that seat. That is a choice that I hope to avoid having to make when AV has come into being and I can put my first preference first and then my other preferences in their order without any danger of defeating my preferred second choice by voting for my preferred first choice.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="10122115000078"></a>I was going on to say that I think the complexity of the Rooker system and the sheer difficulty of explaining it counts very heavily against it. I do not take the view that voters need to understand absolutely everything about voting systems in order to cast their vote, any more than, when I get into my car and turn the key, I require to know all about how the engine works before I drive off. I need to know certain things, such as how to steer, but I do not need to know how the engine works. There are degrees of complexity and, frankly, the Rooker system would be simply impossible to explain. I do not think many people would buy the explanation that was being given. I am sure my noble friend did not have this even in the back of his mind, but one is tempted to think that a complication of this kind is a well-designed sabotage bomb to make sure that the referendum on AV is lost. Therefore, I cannot support the amendment and hope that the House will not support it tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="10122115000080"></a>While my colleagues have been talking about the theory, I have been looking at what might happen in practice if we had an election for the leader of the group of Labour Peers on this side of the House. There are five candidates, Campbell-Savours, Falconer, Foulkes, McAvoy, and Rooker. Those were the only  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_961"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 961</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>five candidates put forward. Alphabetically, Campbell-Savours is number one, Falconer is number two, Foulkes number three, McAvoy number four and Rooker number five. There are 40 electors. Some of them are not here tonight. They are around somewhere and will come in if necessary. If we were to carry out this election under first past the post, the result might be Campbell-Savours 10, Falconer nine, Foulkes eight, McAvoy seven and Rooker six. In that case, Campbell-Savours would be elected and would be our leader. That is the system that we all know. Campbell-Savours would be welcome and we would accept him as our leader and worship him and follow his every lead. He would carry out that leadership with his usual kindness, wisdom and grace.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="10122115000081"></a>However, we could have accepted one form of the alternative vote, which from my recollection of what my noble friends Lord Campbell-Savours and Lord Rooker said in previous speeches, is the Australian federal system in which everyone has to vote one, two, three, four, five. Then we might get this result: 10, nine, eight, seven, six on the first vote. Then Rooker is eliminated and all of his votes would naturally go to Falconer. Noble Lords have seen that in the debates that have taken place. Falconer would now be leading with 15 votes. Campbell-Savours would have 10, Foulkes would have 8 and McAvoy would have seven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="10122115000084"></a>McAvoy is now eliminated. His seven votes are distributed. Four go to Falconer and three go to Foulkes because he cannot quite make up his mind. He is hedging his bets and sees the way the wind is blowing. That leaves 10 to Campbell-Savours-he has not attracted any more votes-19 to Falconer and 11 to Foulkes. But supporters of Campbell-Savours, who is a Foulkes fan, give all their votes to Foulkes, who gets 21 and Falconer only 19. The person who was the third preference is elected. That is the sort of thing that can happen with the alternative vote, as my noble friend Lord Rooker has pointed out on previous occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="10122115000085"></a>So my noble friend Lord Rooker has come up with the most imaginative suggestion. It may be complicated for the counters, as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said. We do not need to worry about the counters, because that will all be done electronically-and we all know how efficient computer systems are at producing election results. Go back to the Scottish elections of 2007 and you will know how really efficient they are. So we do not have to worry about that. We do not really have to worry about having to explain it to the electorate, because they will just vote in the same way-one, two, three, four, five. It is a much more logical system. I agree with my noble friends who have supported my noble friend Lord Rooker-your second preference should not have the same weight as your first preference, and your fourth or fifth preference should certainly not have the same weight as the first preference. On the basis of the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Rooker, he would certainly

<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="10122117000004"></a>This is quite an important amendment. The need for it comes from the fact that, as a result of it being a compulsory referendum, you need to resolve issues about how the alternative vote system works. My noble friend Lord Rooker raises the question that your third, fourth and fifth preferences may not be treated with the same enthusiasm as your first and second preferences and he deals to some extent-although he eschews this in what he says-with the problem that your third, fourth and fifth preference may include unacceptable extremist parties. We do not want their second preferences to determine the vote in the election. We have to address this issue if there is going to be a referendum. We have to address it on the basis that, whether or not you like AV, if the AV referendum wins, how we deal with the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Rooker will determine how we deal with second, third and fourth preferences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="10122117000005"></a>I can see the intellectual force of the position taken by the great intellectual, my noble friend Lord Rooker, but it seems to me to lead to the following problems. First, it says,</p>
<ul><a name="10122117000041"></a>"reallocated ... by the proportion of its preference (that is to say if the candidate was ranked 3 then one third of a vote, if ranked 4 then one quarter of a vote and so on)".</ul>
<p><a name="10122117000040"></a>So if there are 12 candidates, as there are in by-elections from time to time, it could go down to as low as one-twelfth of a vote. That is complicated and it leads

If number one and number two are equal and the twelfth candidate's preferences are given and it is a twelfth for one and none for the other, you win by one-twelfth of a vote. That strikes me as an absurd system of a very high degree of complexity. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has indentified a real problem in relation to AV which has to be addressed in the Bill, because it is a compulsory referendum. We can draw our own conclusions as to whether AV is the right system or not, but this does have to be addressed. While I recognise the problems that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, points out, my own view is that the right course is to go with something that is clear, simple and practical, rather than a system that-</p>

I start by reassuring the House that although I have an interest in electoral systems, I cannot recall ever going to bed thinking about them.  I doubt I will even do so tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="10122117000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has put forward a system that would involve some fractional vote. As I read his amendment, at first I thought, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours understood it, that the second preference got half of a vote, the third preference got a third of a vote, the fourth preference a quarter of a vote, and so on. However, in the light of the comments the noble Lord made on 8 December, his intention may instead be that where there is no winner in the first round of counting, and a further round of counting is necessary, the value of any votes reallocated from the eliminated candidates to the candidates who are still in the count would be determined by the position the eliminated candidate had in the first round of counting. In other words, if the eliminated candidate finished fifth, the value of the reallocated vote would be one-fifth and so on. The fact that there is that dubiety in the amendment-when I first read it, I took it to mean the same as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, obviously did-underlines the complexity that arises.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="10122117000016"></a>My noble friend Lord Lamont said that the important thing, in terms of simplicity for the voters, is that they are invited to number their candidates 1, 2, 3 and 4 and, if there is complexity, that is for the counters to work out. If we went down the road proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, there would be some complexity when we were being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman and we were trying to explain where the one-quarter vote and the one-fifth vote came into it. However, I also take the point that the noble Lords, Lord McAvoy and Lord Lipsey, and others made, that although at one level voters are invited to order their preferences as 1, 2, 3 and 4 so far as they wish, there nevertheless is a requirement that they have some understanding. They do not need to know all the complex details, but they need to have some understanding of how the system will work.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="10122117000017"></a>The purpose of the alternative vote with the system that we are proposing is that it gives equal weight to votes that are still in the count. That meets the clear, simple and practical tests that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, suggested that there should be.

Where some would say that people "part company", I would suggest instead that there is a misunderstanding of the position in failing to make the distinction between a preference and a vote, or in somehow suggesting that if, for the sake of argument, the BNP came last and were first  to be eliminated, it would be the second preferences  of the BNP's vote that determined the outcome. In fact, it would be the voters' second preferences that determined it.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="10122117000018"></a>It was said that everyone should have two votes and it is not right that, at the second count, someone has only one vote, whereas the person whose second preference has been transferred has two votes. In fact, at the second count, the person who expressed the first preference and who is still leading has a vote again. The vote still counts as a full vote in the second count.</p>

The noble Lord has hit it right on the head. The additional preferences, the second preferences, of those voters who voted BNP as their first preference, when transferred, could take the top candidate over the  50 per cent threshold and thereby secure the election of that candidate. At the same time all the other second preferences, or whichever preferences, of all the other candidates would be completely ignored. That is the central flaw in the AV system, which is why Conservatives should be opposing it. The only AV system that gets over that problem is the one that I designed-SV. It is built to avoid precisely that happening, because the second preferences are all transferred in one go to the top two candidates, and you avoid all that nonsense. The noble Lord hit it right on the head.</p>

Those people's first preference will still count. Some people say that you might prefer your second preferences over your first; that is a matter for the individual voter. However, this allows individuals to give their first

Under the present system, anyone who votes for a candidate who wins, which is more than a majority of one, is technically described as a wasted vote, too. We are getting into the debate of the first past the post system against the alternative system. That is a matter for the referendum campaign. We could go round the houses debating the relative merits of the system, as  I will do during the referendum campaign, but what I am seeking to do for the purposes of this amendment is to indicate that the reallocated votes of the fractional votes imports a degree of complexity and it means that votes do not have full value in subsequent counts, which would happen under the system proposed in  the Bill.</p>

With regard to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, as I have indicated, we do not favour an approach that would involve a reallocation of votes on a fractional basis. There are practical considerations. Nor, I understand, does the Front Bench opposite. There could be complications for voters in understanding it. I take the point that all the voter has to do is go into the polling station and write 1, 2, 3, 4. Nevertheless, understanding is required.

I wanted to concentrate on the main cause, which is this one and I freely admit is not run of the mill. I came across a reference-only a reference-to the system in a footnote to some text  I read recently. I thought it was the solution. One way or another, the central flaw in AV has been explained by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, and my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. It will be incredibly difficult to explain to people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="10122117000035"></a>I am not arguing about the text; I know what I understood and I explained what I wanted. It is the vote for the person who comes last, whether they are third, fourth or fifth, that gets transferred. It is true

I might be accused of being completely unfair but I look on that allocation as a new vote. The others have not been altered. These are new votes coming into the system. If there were seven candidates, the one coming seventh would be knocked out. I have assumed that the bottom one would be knocked out but sometimes it might be the bottom two. The reallocation of the second choices of the voters who voted for the candidate who came seventh would be new votes for the top six. In a way, it is not the same election. That is what is so unfair about it. Nobody else's second preference comes into play. As I say, there is an inherent difficulty in this system, which will be apparent only when we come to use it.</p>

You automatically get two votes. They are two votes because the first was for the Monster Raving Loony Party and the second is for someone else, whereas every other voter has one vote because he does not change it at all. The argument stands constantly, which is why AV is such a silly system.</p>

This is why the French have a two-round system. You can see what happens and adjust your vote accordingly. You do not get the chance to do that with this system; it is all or nothing when you put your preferences in. All I am saying is that there must be a fairer system than what is proposed. This will fall apart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="10122117000038"></a>I will conclude on this. Examples have been given of the Scottish by-elections. We have not tried this in 600 or 650 constituencies in every part of the country under the full glare and analysis of every local anorak. I am not an anorak; I resent that term, I must say. This system has not been exposed to what will happen in 2015, assuming five years and assuming this system. That is where it is likely to come apart and there will be a backlash. I am trying to put some more fairness in the system. I made the point earlier about the fairness in the constituencies, the equal numbers. It has to be apparent to people that what is proposed is a fairer system-I might argue about the detail, but I agree with that. This puts a bit of fairness into the way the votes are counted under this proposed AV system. It would not be my first choice but it is genuinely trying to put fairness into the system. I am not saying it is perfect and it would be complicated for the counters. If it is done by computers fair enough; it is not a problem but it might be difficult to explain. I have to say though that it is not half as difficult to explain as the paragraphs the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, read out when explaining the Government's views.

I do not find the debates we have had on this Bill, particularly today's debate, in any way calculated to bring this House into disrepute. It has been a thoughtful, if somewhat protracted debate. Whether the Faustian compact which the parties opposite have entered into might bring politics into disrepute is of course another matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="10122122000003"></a>One thing that surprised me today-as it has on previous occasions-is the remarkable claim that this Bill is somehow the greatest constitutional Bill ever brought since the Great Reform Act of 1832, which we celebrate in Newcastle by having a statue to Earl Grey who promoted that remarkable piece of legislation. Surely it is not to be compared with the extension of the franchise, first of all to all male voters and then eventually to all women voters, let alone the Parliament Act of 1911 which the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, expatiated on with some passion during a previous debate. Nevertheless, we are where we are and we certainly still have much to discuss.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="10122122000004"></a>I could not possibly compete with my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours and his mastery of the electoral consequences of a variety of systems, nor could I imagine acquiring the extensive knowledge that his research has produced. I would however suggest that he slightly errs in saying that Liberals and Liberal Democrats have opposed AV. In fact, 80 years ago this very month an agreement was reached between the then minority Labour Government and the Lloyd George Liberals to bring forward proposals for an alternative vote. I think they were overtaken by rather more dramatic events even than we have experienced recently within a few months of that date. It may have been a different system but it was AV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="10122122000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, who has spoken about theoretical elections among Members on these Benches, will know as I do that the Labour Party has most of its elections conducted on the alternative vote system. Indeed, the use of that system deprived me of the opportunity of joining the noble Lord, Lord Deben, in another place some 35 years ago. I maintained the same vote in three ballots for a selection in Newcastle East, whereas the successful candidate eventually, one Michael Thomas who will be known and remembered fondly by some on the Benches opposite, succeeded in garnering the votes of the unsuccessful candidates. I do not complain about that. In fact, I remain in support of the alternative vote.</p>

I have been a candidate in council elections 16 times- 15 times successfully and once unsuccessfully in a parliamentary election. I have been an instructing solicitor in public inquiries into boundaries and I have given evidence at public inquiries into boundaries-an opportunity which will of course be denied me in future if the Bill goes through in its present form. It will be denied not only to me, which is hardly relevant, but to many other people as well. Nevertheless, I support the principle of the alternative vote.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="10122122000007"></a>However, we come to the method. Under my amendment, we are back to the business of thresholds, which we discussed in another context earlier. Reference has been made by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, and others, today and previously, to Churchill's dictum. Others more recently have also pronounced their concern that votes for very fringe-party candidates may then be redistributed. I heard David Blunkett, for example, expressing that concern on the radio, and others have made that point.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="10122122000008"></a>The amendment tries to minimise that effect. It points to a threshold only above which votes would be redistributed and votes for candidates receiving very small percentages of the vote would not be redistributed. That seems to be a simpler way of dealing with matters. It is comparable to the position of the deposit in parliamentary elections and is preferable, if I may say so, to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Rooker, because, on his formulation, in a three-way marginal such as Oldham, the votes, as it turned out at the last election, are split almost exactly three ways. On the formulation of my noble friend, someone who is only 2,000 votes behind the successful candidate, but very close in percentage terms to achieving a third of the votes, would have had their votes transferred, with only one third being valid, despite their votes having been very close to the candidate with the highest number of votes. That does not seem to be a sensible approach.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="10122122000009"></a>My amendment would in this case not have affected the outcome as between those three candidates, but it is a way of meeting at least some of the objections to the proposition that Monster Raving Loony Party candidates, or the BNP or whatever, might unduly influence the outcome of an election, having achieved only a small percentage of the vote. That is a way of improving the AV system. It is simpler for the electorate, it is simpler also in terms of the count and does not do any violence to the principle of the alternative vote. I beg to move.</p>

There might be, for example, a local campaigner with a specific goal which you strongly support, but you do not necessarily want to waste your vote entirely by supporting that candidate if there is a danger that it will be eliminated. The amendment means that it is less likely, rather than not likely, that the winning candidate will get 51 per cent of the vote. As we know, under the present system, only a third of Members of the House of Commons received as much as half of their electorate's votes. We do not have an exact figure as to what that would increase to under AV, but if you said 86 per cent or 90 per cent, you would probably be right. The amendment would reduce that back down again nearer to the present third. For those reasons, I cannot support my noble friend in his well meant amendment.</p>

On the other hand, romantic candidates, Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidates and the "independent with a cause" candidate can all sound okay but, in a serious parliamentary democracy, is it right that such a small proportion of the vote should be used elsewhere? We are running serious elections for serious and responsible elected positions and, although having the freedom to stand for election and to campaign and so on is an absolute right, I do not think that that type of candidate who polls less than 5 per cent of the vote should be allowed to distort the electoral system and the democratic process. Then again, I keep asking myself why people get involved in that kind of party when it is all a lot of nonsense. Nevertheless, speaking as a realistic politician, I have to say that the amendment is before us and it needs to be discussed. However, if anyone wishes to use their charms on me, I am still willing to be convinced by an objection to my noble friend's amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Deben, in regarding Green Party candidates as more worthy than those of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, is effectively making a value judgment about parties based only on the number of votes that they receive. It seems to me that it is very difficult to see a logical or intellectual basis for saying that 5 per cent or below is not an acceptable figure. Is there a political argument that says that 5 per cent or less is the sort of figure that extremist parties get? Possibly there is but, again, I believe that in relation to an electoral system it is dangerous to start characterising people whom you do not like as "extremist". Of course, we all regard the BNP as extremist but there are other parties that some of us would regard as extremist and others would not. Therefore, although I understand the purpose of my noble friend's amendment, I do not think that it stacks up, so I am afraid we will not support it.</p>

Just because the total is a small figure, there is no reason why the second preference votes should carry any less value. It is also important to reflect, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, that the purpose of a system is to provide a wide choice for voters. Under this system, every vote has equal value and is allocated to the candidate who is ranked highest in the preferences marked on the ballot paper and who is still in the contest. It is only fair to assume that in a second round the person marked as the first preference is the one whom the voter wishes to see come first, and it is important that that vote has full value.</p>

Is that provision still there? If that is the case, I am afraid my noble and learned friend, Lord Falconer, might have to rethink because, if someone is going to lose their deposit, why should the votes be transferred? The threshold for losing the deposit was set at that level for a particular reason. I do not remember when it was set and what the reason was, but presumably it was that the candidate had failed to convince enough electors.</p>

Let us remember that at recent general elections in this country and at a Scottish election in 2003 a candidate posing hospital closures won. It might not necessarily have been obvious at the outset that these people were going to get far more than 5 per cent, but the fact that they are perhaps not mainstream in no way means that they should be devalued. It may well put people off from voting for candidates who appear to be coming from a local campaign, or let us say a non-mainstream party, if it was thought in some way that the second preference was not going to count. The object, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, is to broaden choice, and I fear that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, would not contribute to that broader choice.

<p><a name="10122122000023"></a>so we will have a very different series of announcements during the course of an election. Obviously what happens now is that the returning officer says what votes everyone has in the first past the post system. We know who has won and who has lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="10122122000048"></a>On the basis of new Section 45B(1), I envisage after the first round of counting, in which most prospective parliamentary candidates will not get 50 per cent of the votes, that there will be a public announcement in each constituency of where it has got to.

Thirdly, why not wait until the end of the count to make public how it went at each stage? I should make it clear that I do not for one moment suggest that the individual candidates and their representatives should not be told how each round has gone after each round so that they can legitimately question any aspect of what has happened in that round, but I would be keen to know what the reasons were. That may be perfectly justified, but my goodness me it will make it an extremely complicated and long drawn-out evening and next morning if you insist-I am not saying that this is the wrong thing, I just want to hear the reasons-that at each stage there be a public announcement of where it has got to. This amendment seeks to probe the Government's picture of how this will work, their thinking behind it and how much it will elongate the process.</p>

It is dangerous to include in  a Bill a power to amend primary legislation when you have no primary legislation in mind but think it might be useful later on-particularly in relation to future legislation where you think you might have made a mistake and you then want to use the power to amend it. It appears to circumvent the important scrutiny that this House and the other place give to primary legislation. Will the noble and learned Lord think again about primary legislation? I am happy with secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="10122122000044"></a>I remind those who are not too familiar with the Scottish electoral system that 73 Members are elected by first past the post-that is 71 for all the mainland constituencies and Orkney and Shetland have the special advantage of a having constituency each. That should please the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. So 73 are elected by first past the post based on the votes that individual candidates got in each of the constituencies, and then 56 Members are elected-seven Members for each of eight regions-on a top-up basis based on the vote obtained by the party in that region. I would find it very interesting if someone could explain to me-I ask the Minister because he was the acting First Minister as well as the Deputy First Minister-how I managed to get elected because I could then explain it to the electorate. I am not sure how the votes came to be transferred to me and, ultimately, I was the last person elected on the Lothian list.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="10122122000045"></a>I do not think the electorate understood. It was a fascinating campaign. When I used to stand in south Ayrshire, in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, as a Member of Parliament, I spent right up to-and certainly not beyond-the limit of the election allocation. In spite of the fact that my majority in 1997 was  over 21,000, I still campaigned very hard, went around every part of the constituency, and fought a huge campaign putting my name before the electorate in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. When I got elected to the list in Lothians, I spent nothing on the election campaign. We did not run a huge campaign for me, though we did for the Labour Party and for the constituency members. It is a bizarre system, which even the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, who was one of the main architects of the system-it is a pity that he is not here tonight-regrets having introduced and would like to see revisited. I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, has come round to that point of view yet-I hear the muttering of the Leader of the House-but it indicates how unwise it is to go into systems without fully realising their implications, because there are huge, unintended consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="10122122000046"></a>I have tabled the amendment because the Scottish Parliament was deeply concerned and offended by the fact that it was not consulted about the date on which the UK Government intended to hold the referendum on the alternative vote. The Scottish Government felt the same way-I am more concerned about the Parliament than the Government, but their response was the same. Here we are dealing with Schedule 10. In it it is suggested that the Electoral Commission, and no one else, should be consulted. Until recently-a few months ago-there was no one on the Electoral Commission with any experience of either elections or referenda. That situation has been improved with the addition of four members, including my noble friend Lord Kennedy, George Reid and the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, who is sitting opposite. The commission's knowledge of elections and referendums has been strengthened; I welcome her and my noble friend's membership of it. However, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly should

To one such as me who has been in this House for four or five months, it certainly gives rise to a new experience. It may sound pretentious or boastful, but my instinct tells me that some kind of watershed has been breached tonight, and not for the better. Why are we debating this amendment at this time of night? I do not think that it is the best time to be discussing legislation, and never have done. In the other place, it was one of these things that Oppositions would do to strut their stuff and Governments would do the same. After a decent couple of nights, both sides would behave themselves. Today is unique because we are debating this issue  at almost one o'clock in the morning. We have to look at why and how we arrived here. A big chunk of time was taken out today by three Statements. I am not complaining about that, because they were very important, and it was right that the House should have the benefit of listening to Ministers.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="10122123000001"></a>As I understand it, there was co-operation, through the usual channels-if I am wrong on this, I am sure I will get pounced upon. Because of the three Statements, and in co-operation with the Government, we waived the right to a fourth Statement. Nobody has pounced upon me yet, so I think that there must be something in it. That shows, in my book, that the usual channels on the Opposition's side was responsible for saying that as there already going to be a chunk of time taken out of today's deliberations, therefore it was a reasonable and fair-a much used, or abused word in here at the moment-to waive the right to the fourth Statement.  I think it was right that the Statements were heard; I respected the Government for that. They are under pressure to get the Bill through, yet they have still lived up to their responsibilities as a Government and made these three Statements.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="10122123000002"></a>I do not know what has happened since then. I am not party, first hand, to what has been said and done tonight, but I know enough about the place, because traditionalists such as my noble friends Lord Campbell-Savours, Lord Lipsey and Lord Foulkes have drummed into me the importance of the conventions here and of the conventions being honoured and recognised.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="10122123000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, has commented that I have taken to the place like a duck to water, which means that I have supported the conventions up till now; I agreed with them and saw the need for them because this place is special. I know that he was gently making fun of me and that is fine, that is part of the routine. I hope he was-he did not agree when I said that. I assume that it was said in a jocular way and I certainly accept that. If you are going to poke fun, you have to be able to take some fun back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="10122123000004"></a>However, my understanding, again from the usual channels-my noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton mentioned this at the Dispatch Box, so I am not breaking any confidences-was that there was an understanding/agreement, that going past 10 o'clock  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be fine, but that we would finish at 10.40 pm, which I understand is something called taxi time. I do not know what that means; I take it that that is for the staff. When my noble friend Lord Bassam mentioned that, the Leader of the House just completely ignored him, completely bulldozed him and said we would finish the clause. I do not think that that is right. If there is timetabling to be done-I do not know all the rules in this place, but I will learn over time-would it not have been possible for the Government to have given notice that they wanted extra time so that folk could prepare?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="10122123000007"></a>I have left the Liberals alone up till now, but the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, invites me in. How can any Liberal, with their high sense of duty, their superiority complex over the years, looking down at mere politicians, not only of the Labour Party, but of the Tory Party-they are a cut above, intellectually and spiritually pure-endorse, support and even vigorously lead the behaviour tonight? They ought to be ashamed of themselves, because not only have they endorsed it, they have given enthusiastic leadership to it and it is a breach of the conventions of the House.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="10122123000008"></a>My noble friend rightly mentioned the Scottish Parliament. In passing, and he did not get pulled up for it, he mentioned how Orkney and Shetland had two seats in the Scottish Parliament. I remember at the time thinking, "That's okay for them isn't it?" How anybody can advocate and support that position and maintain a credible reputation is beyond me. Certainly, on this side of the House, it is okay for that part of the world, part of my own country, to get preferential treatment on the basis of two seats in the Scottish Parliament and influence the governance of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="10122123000009"></a>The Scottish Parliament is there and it is coming to be respected more by the Scottish people. To be treated in a cack-handed, offhand way by the Westminster Government only gives succour to the nationalists and separatists and those who think that independence will carry a crescent of prosperity for Scotland, the Nordic countries and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="10122123000010"></a>It was said that the Electoral Commission should be consulted/notified and not the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament was not even consulted about the date of the referendum. That is a complete insult and an offhand way of doing things. It was under the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister-a Liberal. There is a situation where a Liberal has played a leading role in insulting the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="10122123000011"></a>It is not the best kept secret that my personal position prior to Scottish Labour Party decisions and the position of the relevant constituency Labour Party was of complete, total and utter opposition to the

We are a unionist constituency party and all our representatives are unionists and always have been. Behaviour such as has been indulged in by the Liberal Deputy Prime Minister of this Tory-led Government has shown that they will damage the union.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="10122123000012"></a>I can sense from the Scottish non-political public that there is resentment about that. I will be quite honest about this. Scotland is not one homogeneous nation in every single sense of the word. There are different attitudes in each area. I think I am an average west of Scotland person. I would certainly say that  I am not Glaswegian. We are a bit contrary in a sense because as an area we might be critical of the Scottish Parliament. We may be critical of some decisions and the way it sometimes behaves. We may even say, "I wish it wasn't there". Sometimes the west of Scotland takes that attitude. But any insult slung at the Scottish Parliament from somebody from outside the area, especially from outside Scotland and-without being racist in any way because I am British and Scottish-especially from England, gets the contrary side of the west of Scotland people. They then start defending the Scottish Parliament and take umbrage and exception to the behaviour of any critical comments or attacks on it coming from outside Scotland, especially from England. They give succour to the Scottish Nationalist Party and separatists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="10122123000013"></a>For the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, if he is listening, I fully support my noble friend's amendment. It is right that the Scottish Parliament should be recognised. It has been elected and to me that is above all else. It should be given a place in Scottish public life. Quite clearly, it has not been by this Government and not by the Liberal Deputy Prime Minister. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</p>

This amendment would provide for making an order to amend the primary or secondary legislation consequential on amendments made by this clause. Any such award would have to be the subject of consultation with the Electoral Commission and also with the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. The question is, "Why consultation?". I shall address my remarks to the two new noble Lords elevated to this House today, the noble Lords, Lord Lingfield and Lord Dobbs. This is a bit of a baptism of fire for them, really; they must be wondering what they have come into. It is a very good question, and the answer is very simple. We are dealing with a Bill that has been the subject of no consultation whatever. There was no inquiry, no prior scrutiny and no real notice of what was coming, and we object. We are now scrutinising this legislation line by line. Much of this could have been avoided if we had been through a proper process. What those two noble Lords are now seeing is just an abuse of Parliament by way of introducing a Bill in this way. I would advise them-and one hopes that they will stay here for many years to come-that

Because this will go on for weeks, and only because the process that led to this legislation was wrong. That is all that I have  to say.</p>

<p><a name="10122123000030"></a>At the moment, the Minister has to consult the Electoral Commission. Inevitably, amendments made under Clause 9(4) could affect the position in relation to the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament. As to how they might affect primary legislation-I see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, looking troubled by that. He has just said very candidly that he has no idea what primary legislation might be amended by using Clause 9(4). His inability to understand that it might affect the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly is surprising, I have to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="10122123000017"></a>Before you produce an order that amends primary legislation, which currently cannot be identified-I am not criticising the noble and learned Lord for that-and which may not even be passed, because it may include future legislation, what is wrong with consulting the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly? We have had read to us the views of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly on a number of occasions about the fact that they were not consulted about the date of the referendum, which is taking place on the same day as the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly elections. They were plainly upset by that. What is the purpose of not consulting? What is the anxiety about consulting? We are talking about a national electoral system here, and a national vote. Surely the Scottish Parliament might have views that could be taken into account. I ask the noble and learned Lord to take that position into account. Points have been made about what has happened this evening. It is four minutes past one now. My understanding of how the House operates is that the Government Whip and Leader consult and then decide what to do. The Leader of the House today appeared not even to consult his own Chief Whip about sitting until four minutes past one. The reason I say that is because I am told by the Opposition Chief Whip that the noble Baroness was proposing that we went on for one more amendment. It might well have been sensible to go on to four minutes past one, but we have done it without, for example, giving the staff warning in advance and without there being proper consultation. All I say to the Leader of the House, who is much liked in the House, is please consult before going on till five past one.</p>

But the effect of the amendments brought forward by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, would be that, before any order was made under Clause 9(4), the Minister would be required to consult the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, in addition, of course, to the Electoral Commission. As I indicated in my response to the previous amendment, the kind of changes that are anticipated under this order-making power are for matters such as the information that goes on the polling card; information that would go with a postal voting statement; matters which currently reflect the first past the post system, but obviously would need to be changed with an alternative vote, should that be the will of the electorate in the referendum.</p>

Voting systems for UK parliamentary elections is a reserved matter. It was a matter of common ground in the Act that was put forward by the previous Labour Government, which I was happy to support and was supported by the Scottish people; the Government of Wales Act was supported by the Welsh people in a referendum; likewise for Northern Ireland, where it was agreed that UK parliamentary elections are reserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="10122123000022"></a>It is not necessary, therefore, for the UK Government to be subject to a statutory requirement to consult the devolved Parliament and Assemblies before making an order, which will be of a technical nature.

The practice of the Cabinet Office, which leads on electoral policy issues, is to work closely with colleagues in the territorial departments-the Scotland Office, the Wales Office, the Northern Ireland Office-on policy proposals. They would be able to highlight any concerns or issues affecting the particular part of the United Kingdom. I have no doubt that, if the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament had particularly strong views on the wording of a polling card that would be taken into account but I do not believe that it is necessary given the fact that this is a wholly reserved matter. It has been accepted on all sides that it is a wholly reserved matter that requires a statutory requirement. The Electoral Commission is in a different position, because the Electoral Commission has a host of responsibilities with regard to the material that is published and goes out in association with an election. As I indicated, I am sure that if representations were received from the Welsh National Assembly, they would be considered on their merits, but on a matter which is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government, a statutory requirement to consult is not necessary. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

He mentioned that if the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament had particularly strong views, even on a matter that is wholly the responsibility of the United Kingdom, they would be taken account of. I do not know if he was in at Question Time today-no, it was when the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, repeated a Statement about the immigration bar. The Minister will know from his own experience that the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament are very exercised about the particular concerns of Scotland in relation to imposing an immigration bar, but, when I asked the noble Baroness whether the Scottish Government had been consulted, she did not even know.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="10122123000026"></a>That goes against the kind of assurance that the Minister has given. I am sure that he is genuine and that he is right, but there are people like the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones-I do not know if she has ever been to Scotland; she certainly seems to know very little about it-who do not really pay much attention to what is happening in Scotland. This is a matter of importance. I hope that the Minister, since he has a wider responsibility than just this Bill, will ensure that some of the departments are taking account of Scottish issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="10122123000027"></a>My noble friend Lord McAvoy raised a number of issues, particularly in relation to what has happened tonight. I ask him to give some sympathy to the position of the noble Lord the Leader of the House. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for him when every time he goes to a Cabinet meeting or bumps into David Cameron in the Lobby and has to explain why  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_985"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column 985</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he is not managing to get his legislation through? I understand the difficulty that he is in, and it serves him right. No, I sympathise with him. However, I hope that he will also genuinely understand-just as I genuinely understand the pressures that he is under-our concern for parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, which are of absolute importance. He has been on this side of the House often enough, and he will be again-sooner, probably, than he realises. So I hope that he will take account of that.</p>

<a name="101220-0004.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="10122123000028"></a>I welcome the new Members. I am sure that they did not know what to expect. One of them has written a novel about this place, which is how I know there is a toilet behind the Throne; but for that, I would not have known. You learn a lot of interesting things, and I hope that he has learnt some tonight. I really am tempted to push this to a vote, to give them the opportunity on their first day to go through the Lobby, get their name down and get their tick to say that they

I see the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greenland-is it Greenland? Is it Lord Green of Shuttland? I see that the noble Lord is equally enthusiastic about having a voice, since he would be one of the Tellers; I see his happy face every time I go through the Lobby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="10122123000029"></a>I am tempted to vote on this. However, because of the clear and convincing explanation that the Minister gave, and because my noble friend Lady Browning, the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, and George Reid are on the Electoral Commission now, I have much more faith in it better representing some of our interests. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This treaty has not yet entered into force, but will do so once all 27 members of the European Union and the Republic of Indonesia have ratified it. This order is a necessary step towards the UK's ratification.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000004"></a>The principal effect of the draft order is, first, to ensure that the powers under Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 would be available to give effect to any provisions of the agreement; and, secondly, to permit any expenditure arising from the partnership and co-operation agreement to be met from the Consolidated Fund.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000005"></a>We have a strategic interest in developing the UK's and the EU's relationships with Indonesia. As south-east Asia's largest economy and emerging power, its international influence is growing through its membership of the G20 and it is a key country on climate change issues. It is the world's third-biggest carbon emitter,  as well as a major energy producer and consumer. It  is also on course to be the fifth-largest economy in  the world by 2030, which is only 20 years away. We are  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>talking about a new but vibrant democracy and the world's largest moderate Muslim-majority country, which certainly is moving towards being rated as having the most liberal stance in south-east Asia.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000006"></a>The partnership and co-operation agreement should enable us to deepen trade and investment links and make the most of the many commercial opportunities which lie in Indonesia today. It is also a necessary precursor to an EU-Indonesian free trade agreement. I should explain that the agreement has been ratified so far by four EU member states. Others expect their domestic processes to be completed by early 2011.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000007"></a>I am satisfied that the order is compatible with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. This order is important for our nation, for the European Union and for world trade. I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000008"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1012202000077"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order and for the brevity of his presentation, which I shall try to copy. It is good to read a treaty that clearly represents a factor in a good relationship, in this case between the European Union and Indonesia. It includes the sort of good words that you would hope to see in such a treaty, but reading it left me asking what will specifically come out of it, at what pace and through what mechanisms. I wonder whether the Minister could give me some brief insights.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000009"></a>Article 41 of the framework agreement talks about a joint committee that will meet not less than every two years. That does not have a strong sense of urgency about it. The essence of such treaties seems to me to be the rate at which they are taken up and used, with practical steps coming forward, yet in the UK you would expect that to fall to BIS and the FCO, both  of which are seeing a reduction in their resources of  25 per cent. However, frankly, the framework has commitments to work between the Community and Indonesia on virtually every area of human activity. Could the Minister comment on what we will do about Article 5, on terrorism? What specific input will the UK make in terms of resources committed to helping Indonesia and ourselves in that extremely important area?</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000010"></a>There are two other important areas, one of which is Article 34, on migration. All the people in the world have an interest in humane movement and controls of people, and particularly in the stamping out of the evil of people trafficking. I hope that we will be able to make some contribution to Indonesia in that area. Finally, and probably most significantly, is the whole issue of deafforestation. Indonesia has the second highest rate of deafforestation after Brazil; it is about half that of Brazil but many times greater than any other nation. The Indonesian forests are a key part of the ecology of the planet. Anything that can be done through co-operation with Indonesia to lower the rate of deafforestation has to be good for climate change and needs to be done fairly urgently.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000011"></a>I am interested in how the Minister can illustrate the practical steps that will follow once this treaty comes into force, which we all hope will be quite soon.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000012"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1012202000078"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> We too welcome this partnership agreement with Indonesia. As the Minister pointed out, it is the largest Muslim country,  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC103"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column GC103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and this agreement is the first with an ASEAN country so it is very welcome. However-he would expect there to be some howevers in such a comprehensive agreement-there are obviously concerns. First, it is undoubtedly true that Indonesia has made significant progress since 1998 in terms of democratic freedoms and human rights. Multi-party democracy is now established and is increasingly becoming entrenched throughout the country, which is no mean feat given the size of the population and the very different traditions evident there. Nevertheless, the agreement-particularly Article 26-is very weak in terms of human rights. It tries to encompass all the European Union's interests in that area in 56 words-Article 27, on environment and natural resources, runs to a couple of hundred words; I did not have time to record quite how long it was-words that are at best dressed up as hopeful sentiments. Its second paragraph states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1012202000060"></a>"Such cooperation may include ... supporting the implementation of the Indonesian National Plan of Action of Human Rights ... human rights promotion and education",</p>

<p><a name="1012202000056"></a>and so on. Those 56 words go on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1012202000061"></a>"The Parties agree that a dialogue between them on this matter would be beneficial".</p>

<p><a name="1012202000057"></a>This is extremely weak and almost inadequate if it is to be a blueprint for how we approach partnership agreements with other countries, particularly in the Muslim world where there are significant concerns about human rights norms. If this is the first such measure, I dread to think what might happen as we proceed with countries with worse records.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000013"></a>Most human rights organisations agree that abuses by security forces have been especially severe in Aceh and Papua. Freedom House recommends that the two most important steps the Government can take to improve civil liberties are keeping the peace process on track in Aceh and engaging in serious dialogue with local leaders in Papua. The Minister will recall that he was asked to deal with some of these questions only last Thursday, 16 December, as recorded at cols. 726 and 727 of <I>Hansard</I>. He was asked about the inability of foreign journalists to travel in these areas and the lack of any transparent, open media coverage of these conflict situations, despite our having raised these issues at the highest level. This raises suspicions that things may be worse than we might imagine. When asked to say what was the response of the Indonesia Government to the Deputy Prime Minister and the ambassador raising these issues, he replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1012202000062"></a>"Not in detail, except that they recognised we have these concerns".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/12/2010; col. 727.]</p>

<p><a name="1012202000058"></a>Given that we are just one of 26 EU countries that have these concerns and were involved in the lead-up to this partnership agreement being agreed on 9 November, and that these ongoing situations constitute extremely severe and serious conflicts with significant loss of life, I should have thought that the EU would be able to take on board that we have rather graver concerns than those set out in Article 26.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000014"></a>Women's rights are also of considerable concern to us. We understand that at some levels Islamic law is incompatible with civil law and that gender equality  is still a long way from being achieved. Therefore, it is  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not only a matter of our exhorting Indonesia to do better but of using the leverage that we had at the point of signing this agreement to achieve something. Naturally, the agreement is set and we will move forward, but I echo the sentiments of the noble Lord opposite that the proof of the pudding will be in the implementation. A joint committee meeting every two years to discuss articles as weak as the ones that I have described will not create the environment whereby we might achieve great advances in these areas.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000015"></a>Finally, Article 44 on resolving differences allows for a party to opt out,</p>
<ul><a name="1012202000063"></a>"except in cases of special urgency".</ul>
<p><a name="1012202000059"></a>Given that we are discussing a country that, even after it embraced democracy, has a record of imposing a state of emergency, it does not instil confidence in one to think that these cases of special urgency will be exceptional. Clearly, we can expect that they would be exceptional in a conflict situation but I hope that, as we go forward with this agreement, we will make representations to the Indonesians that we expect them almost never to be invoked.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000016"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="1012202000079"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, and my noble friend Lady Falkner, for their comments on this issue. We are dealing very briefly with a vast range of issues connected to a vast country. I shall first address the acute points made by the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, about the detail. We have the agreements; where is the detail; if I may use the colloquial, where is the beef?</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000017"></a>Let me describe to the noble Lord four policy areas for closer co-operation-one, in particular, on which he concentrated-which have been agreed already but which the PCA will boost, reinforce and create a new forum in which we can carry them forward. First, on trade and investment, we will, under the PCA, explore new areas of co-operation, including research and development, and a series of sectoral committees will help to identify opportunities and more rapidly defuse irritants in key sectors of commercial interests, which is always a very valuable asset, because small irritants can turn into great barriers if one is not careful and does not handle them very positively indeed.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000018"></a>Secondly, on environment issues, the climate change question is a shared political priority. As I said earlier, Indonesia is the world's third largest carbon emitter, and we will use the PCA to boost co-operation in key environmentally sensitive areas, such as fisheries and afforestation-which the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, rightly raised. A partnership agreement with Norway earlier this year, which the UK supports, should put in place a framework with Indonesia to reduce deafforestation and degradation rates. I fully accept that a lot more work is needed to make the framework robust. The UK committed in December last year-a year ago-to support the achievement of Indonesia's climate change objectives through a five-year, £50 million programme. That is particularly relevant when it comes to deafforestation. It is likely to include significant partnership with the province and district governments of Papua, where the potential for emission reductions, development gains and the checking of deafforestation is very important.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000019"></a>In answer to the general question about the detail, the third area that is very important for us is education. Indonesia and the EU will seek to boost a co-operation agreement in the education field through existing programmes, such as the Erasmus Mundus scholarship programme, which funds Indonesian students to study in the EU; and through a new initiative, such as educational fairs, co-operation on research and other programmes. That will all be reinforced within the PCA forum.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000020"></a>Fourthly, on the area on which my noble friend Lady Falkner rightly concentrated-although when I say that it is fourth, one could say that it is first, because there is no priority of numbers here-the EU-Indonesian human rights dialogue was launched on 29 June last year. My noble friend rightly observes-she is tireless in her accuracy and her work on this front-that rhetoric and saying where we have got to is not enough, and that a lot more work is required. The dialogues are under way already.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000021"></a>The PCA is reinforcement for what has been raised in the dialogues. The aim is regularly to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern related to human rights, including through annual meetings of senior officials. It is an avenue to discuss issues such as that which we discussed in the Chamber of your Lordships' House only the other day-the situation in West Papua, in which there is a great deal of proper and understandable interest. The next dialogue will be in June next year. Beyond that, the existence of the partnership agreement will provide opportunities for pressing further. My noble friend is quite right that one can aspire, for example, to greater access for journalists to the situation in West Papua, or that human rights issues are investigated. We can aspire to see that appropriate dialogue toward some settlement of the West Papuan scene is progressed. Those are aspirations, but carrying them forward requires the most constant, intimate exchanges based on trust and respect.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000022"></a>We fully support the territorial integrity of Indonesia as a great nation, but obviously, like everyone else, we want to see the West Papua situation resolved and human rights respected wherever possible. We will carry on with the procedures that I described to your Lordships last week of raising the issues. But more than that, once the PCA comes into force-of course, it has yet to be approved in the other place-we will have an additional forum in which we can reinforce these views, press them, turn them into real actions and carry them forward.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000023"></a>I thank my noble friend and the noble Lord for their comments. I believe that further engagement of every kind with Indonesia will help us to achieve  in our country greater prosperity because of the  huge opportunities of a vast, new consumer market, with an estimated 35 million to 40 million people with incomes in the range of the European Union's average level of income. This is an enormous, ready-made consumer market, which will grow bigger because the total population is many times that.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000024"></a>It is important to strengthen our ties with Indonesia on the security agenda, about which we have not talked much, but which is very important. It is important to do that while supporting all the ongoing work and

In an effort to further improve international co-operation we are now seeking to designate Japan as a participating country for the purpose of various sections of that Act. This designation is required so that the UK can comply with the provisions of the EU-Japan mutual legal assistance agreement. The UK opted into the Council decision to conclude the agreement on 17 March 2010 -that is to say, under our predecessor Government. The UK opted into this agreement because it will provide significant benefits for the UK in our mutual legal assistance, or MLA, dealings with Japan.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000026"></a>Until now, MLA has been conducted with Japan on an informal basis relying on international comity. I am sure that all noble Lords will be familiar with the concept of international comity-I have been for the past two hours since the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, gave me an informal tutorial in the corridor. This is the first comprehensive framework for MLA between the UK and Japan. It will be of huge benefit in ensuring that requests are dealt with in a timely and efficient manner, and will provide several advances in the range of MLA available, including specific provisions on banking evidence and taking evidence via video link.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000027"></a>The UK must now ensure that it has the necessary secondary legislation in place so that it can fulfil its obligations under the agreement. Article 18 of the agreement enables one party to request the other to ascertain whether banks within their territory possess information on whether a suspect is the holder of an account and to produce records of any such accounts, transactions or recipient accounts. The powers in domestic law through which the UK can comply with these

These provisions are, however, applicable only in relation to a "participating country".</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000028"></a>Under the scheme of the 2003 Act, in order for the UK to seek and provide MLA to a country in accordance with these provisions, that state must fall within the definition of a "participating country", which is contained in Section 51(2)(b) of the 2003 Act. A country falls to be regarded as a participating country under that section if it was a member state of the European Union on the date on which the relevant provision of the 2003 Act was commenced, or if it has been designated as a participating country in an order made by the Secretary of State. To ensure that the UK can comply with certain obligations which arise under the agreement, it is therefore necessary for us to designate Japan as a participating country under Section 56(2)(b) for the purposes of Sections 32, 35 and 43 to 45 of the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000029"></a>Designation for the purposes of Sections 32 and 35 of the 2003 Act will allow the UK to deal with incoming requests for customer banking information and account monitoring information made by the authorities in Japan. Designation for the purposes of Sections 43 and 44 of the Act will allow the UK to make requests for such information to Japan. Section 45 provides that requests for assistance made under Sections 43 and 44 must be sent to the Secretary of State to be forwarded to the relevant authority, unless they are urgent.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000030"></a>Japan is not the only non-EU country designated for those provisions. We have, for example, similar arrangements with Norway and Iceland, as EEA members, and with the United States.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000031"></a>The UK is committed to improving the provision of mutual legal assistance, which is a key tool for ensuring that cross-border crime can be combated and that justice is achieved for British victims of crime. The agreement is a further effort to improve international co-operation and the order, which enables us to meet the terms of the agreement, will therefore be of benefit to British victims of crime. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000032"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1012202000082"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I welcome the order, which the Opposition are happy to support-as the noble Lord no doubt learnt from my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland in what must have been an exciting tutorial a couple of hours ago. As the Minister said, it relates to the Crime (International Co-operation) Act, which the previous Government introduced to enable the UK to participate in improved arrangements for international co-operation in the fight against terrorism and other crime.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000033"></a>As the Minister informed us, the UK opted in to a Council decision to conclude a mutual legal assistance agreement between the EU and Japan. The agreement seeks to improve international co-operation. I understand from the Explanatory Memorandum that, until now, mutual legal assistance has been conducted with Japan on an informal basis. I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on how well that has worked in the past few years. What outcome does he expect from the

What discussions have been held between the UK and Japan to ensure smooth implementation of the agreement? We welcome such agreements. Are there discussions between the EU and other countries to extend the number of participating nations? Any information that the Minister could give on this matter would be much appreciated.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000034"></a>These agreements are clearly important, given the development of cross-border crime. International crime affects us all. Greater freedom to travel and live in other countries and the growth of international trade mean that crime is no longer confined by national boundaries, but the impact of international crime is often felt on a local scale. It is the larger criminal gangs who facilitate local crimes in the UK-for example, by supplying goods or drugs. Drug smuggling is one of the main cross-border crimes and the main activity  of serious and organised criminals, but the problem is not confined to drug trafficking. Other cross-border crimes have an impact on society more widely, such as people trafficking, counterfeiting, money-laundering and cigarette smuggling. Terrorism is, of course, an ever present concern for all of us.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000035"></a>The best way to tackle international crime is to work closely with other countries. In the past, too many obstacles to international investigations have served only to protect the criminal. The success of co-operation between the many countries involved in these agreements is essential in order to combat such crime, which is why we very much support the intentions of the 2003 Act and the order. However-this point has been made both in the passage of the 2003 legislation and in debate on previous orders-it is important that there be confidence in the judicial and police systems of other countries partaking in such agreements. It would be helpful to know from the Minister how confident the Government are that satisfactory standards are in place and being maintained by the countries subject to the agreement, and that they will continue to be monitored in future. Overall, though, we are happy to support the order.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000036"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="1012202000083"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I have not had the benefit of a tutorial from any colleague, in this House or otherwise, on international comity, although I was surprised to see that dealings had occurred "on an informal basis"; this does not seem the sort of subject that should be dealt with informally. Be that as it may, we are told in the Explanatory Memorandum about consultations carried out before the order was put forward. The Serious Organised Crime Agency is not mentioned, and I would be interested to know whether it was consulted. Perhaps it comes under some umbrella that is mentioned. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, the sort of serious crime with which SOCA deals is very much something to be targeted.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000037"></a>The noble Lord has asked almost all my questions, so I will not repeat them unless it will be for anyone's convenience for me to talk a little longer; I have noticed some notes going to and fro. I will ask my noble friend about the position the other way  around; I may have missed something on it. Are there mutual arrangements in Japan? I can deal with this

Whichever countries come within this arrangement, it is clearly important that there is a balance and that we can expect the same assistance from the other country involved.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000038"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="1012202000084"></a>Lord Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for the questions that they have raised. This is a complex area that we will come back to when we are discussing the EU Bill, in which the extension of mutual legal assistance-otherwise known as mutual criminal assistance-will come up in the context of the much more extensive co-operation that we have within the EU under what was the Third Pillar and is now part of the Lisbon treaty, for which Britain has various opt-ins and opt-outs. I was briefed to say that this is an EU-Japan rather than a UK-Japan agreement because it is much more convenient for the Japanese to negotiate with 27 countries as a group rather than with individual countries. I was also briefed to say that there are a number of UK bilateral agreements, including with India and a number of other Commonwealth countries. This is an area in which the European Union and the member states have shared competence, and at the moment we have a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements. I understand that at the moment there are no other negotiations under way between the EU and other member states. I am tempted to suggest to the noble Lord opposite that he might care to start putting questions down on which other countries we might usefully consider that the EU should negotiate with; but that would make more work for the Government, so of course I will not suggest it.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000039"></a>British officials have met the legal attaché at the Japanese embassy to ensure good implementation. While we are talking about the Japanese problem, one of the problems with the informal co-operation under the principle of international comity was that the Japanese had some sovereignty concerns, particularly about video conference links taking evidence from the territory of one country in the territory of another, which are therefore much better covered by this agreement. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that SOCA was consulted on this issue. We apologise  that it is not mentioned here.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000040"></a>Previous experience in terms of numbers of requests is that the British have received much more information from the Japanese so far than they have received from us. We have many more requests of them. The video-link evidence has been a particular problem, but the banking evidence is also one for which, as the international financial system becomes much more complex, the agreement now gives a much firmer framework for future consultation.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000041"></a>I strongly agree with the noble Lord opposite that questions of people smuggling are becoming increasingly important. There is a whole range of areas in which serious crime is now almost automatically trans-national or international crime. The likelihood is that, under Governments of different characters, we will have a succession of agreements like this. All of us cling to national sovereignty, but as crime increasingly crosses frontiers, we have to have agreements like this.</p>

The effect of this order would be to control the export of the drug sodium thiopental to the United States of America. It prohibits the export of sodium thiopental to the United States unless the exporter has first obtained a licence from my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000044"></a>Sodium thiopental is an anaesthetic widely used in the United Kingdom and Europe, but it is also used in several states in the United States of America to anaesthetise prisoners prior to execution. For several months there has been a shortage of sodium thiopental in the United States, which has caused at least some individual states to seek supplies of the medicine elsewhere. There is evidence that the state of Arizona obtained the sodium thiopental used in a recent execution from the United Kingdom. On 28 October 2010, Leigh Day &amp; Co, solicitors acting for Mr Edmund Zagorski, a prisoner on death row in Tennessee, wrote to my right honourable friend in another place inviting him to place controls on the export of sodium thiopental. While affirming the United Kingdom's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances, my right honourable friend declined to impose export controls on the drug. His primary concern was that he should not take action which might cause delays in the export of a medicine which some patients may need.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000045"></a>The High Court granted permission to Leigh Day &amp; Co to conduct a judicial review of my right honourable friend's decision. In light of this, he reaffirmed on 12 November his decision not to impose a control. He reiterated that there remained a possibility of significant legitimate trade in this important medicine and that  it was unlikely that an order to control its export would be effective in preventing any execution. The first hearing of the case took place on Wednesday 17 November. On 22 November, the court indicated  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it would dismiss the claimants' arguments that my right honourable friend was under a duty by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights or the common law to make an export control order. The court refused to grant interim relief, which would have required him to make a control order. The court adjourned the claimants' public law challenge, which was due to be heard on Monday 29 November. In the mean time, however, all parties sought to clarify the extent of any possible lawful trade in sodium thiopental. Having consulted United States lawyers, they all agreed that, under applicable federal law, it is not currently lawful to import sodium thiopental into the United States for medical purposes. Moreover, in the course of the legal action, it was established that sodium thiopental is at present hardly ever used for legitimate medical purposes in the United States of America-although, as I have indicated, it is used widely as an anaesthetic around the world. These two discoveries mean that an order controlling the export of sodium thiopental to the United States of America should not, in fact, have any adverse impact on patients in the United States of America or on UK exporters.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000046"></a>The order before us reflects the particular circumstances of the United States of America and applies only to that country. The United States of America is unique in that sodium thiopental is not currently used there in medicine but is used for capital punishment. An order which controlled the export of sodium thiopental more widely would have affected legitimate medical trade in a way that this order would not. On 29 November, my right honourable friend decided that these new developments significantly strengthened the arguments in favour of a control order. Such an order would serve to underline the United Kingdom's moral opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances without affecting legitimate trade. My right honourable friend therefore announced that he would make an order under Section 6 of the Export Control Act 2002, controlling the export of sodium thiopental from the United Kingdom to the United States. The order came into force on Tuesday 30 November. From that date, any person seeking to export sodium thiopental from the United Kingdom to the United States of America requires a licence issued by the Export Control Organisation, which will refuse a licence if the stated end use is execution, or if it considers there to be an unacceptable risk that the drug will be diverted for use in execution. In the latter case, it would assess the risks case by case in the light of all relevant factors. A breach of the order is a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000047"></a>Noble Lords may wish to note that the control order covers both the direct and indirect export of sodium thiopental from the United Kingdom to the United States of America. The indirect control applies when the destination is not the US, but the exporter knows that the goods will be re-exported and that the ultimate destination is indeed the United States.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000048"></a>The order was laid before Parliament pursuant to the procedure in Section 13 of the 2002 Act and, unless approved by a resolution of each House within 40 days, it will cease to have effect. Orders made under Section 6 last for a maximum of 12 months. On the basis of the facts that I have outlined, I conclude by

I welcome the Government's full explanation and clarification that the order will require a Secretary of State licence, whether it is direct or indirect control, which is important. I also welcome the assurance that there will be a monitoring and review process. I cannot help but ask one question, as a result of my O-level chemistry that I never got. Like the Minister and the Explanatory Memorandum, I always refer to the drug as sodium thiopental, but I notice that the order reverses that and refers to thiopental sodium. From mere curiosity, I am wondering why that is the case. I hope that those behind the Minister who know the answer to everything will tell us why the words have been reversed. That aside, I welcome the Government's decision.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000050"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="1012202000088"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> My Lords, I, too, support this somewhat bizarre order, which I am sure noble Lords from all sides will welcome. I have three questions resulting from the Explanatory Memorandum. As someone who spent an early part of my life working as a lawyer campaigning against capital punishment in the United States, I would be interested to know which two states have used this drug to effect execution rather than simply to anaesthetise the condemned person before execution.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000051"></a>Secondly, it is obviously clear from the action taken by the lawyer for one of the people on death row that he or she believes that if this supply can be stopped there would be an advantage, presumably, to either postponing or stopping the execution of his or her client. If export of this drug from the United Kingdom does not take place, are we aware as to from where the relevant execution chambers will obtain the drug? Will this have a major effect on executions in the United States or is there a simple alternative source of supply?</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000052"></a>Thirdly, the fact that this order is being brought indicates that presumably there has been export of sodium thiopental in the past from the United Kingdom to the United States. Do we have any idea what the volume of that has been? Will this have a direct effect on drug companies which have been exporting it or is this simply a theoretical order that will have no practical effect? I obviously overwhelmingly support the order.</p>

<p><a name="1012202000053"></a><b><a name="101220-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="1012202000089"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Young, and my noble friend Lord Razzall, for their questions. I can answer the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Young, fast and easily. Both versions of the drug's name are in common use. But, with his O-level chemistry background, it is right that the noble Lord should check and I am delighted that he is able to support the amendment.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000054"></a>My noble friend Lord Razzall asked where else the drug can be obtained. It is manufactured in Austria and Italy. We have no information about suppliers outside the European Union. I am afraid that we will have to write to my noble friend as regards where the

We do not have that information at the moment. With my noble friend's past interest-I understand my noble friend said that he has campaigned in the United States against the death penalty-obviously that information will be of interest to him.</p>

<a name="101220-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="1012202000055"></a>My noble friend also asked what volume has been imported. We have no figures on imports to the United States of America. It cannot lawfully be imported to the US for medical purposes, so the volumes must be

I hope that these are helpful answers. If there are no other questions, I conclude by reiterating that, on the basis of the facts outlined in the opening statement, I commend the order to the Committee.

I have therefore worked with the Minister for Security in preparing this Green Paper to reflect our new approach. We have also included cybersecurity as a separate section, because it is a new and fundamental challenge.</p>

We will take action to protect our operational advantages and freedom of action, but only where essential for national security.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1012203000017"></a>In the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in April 1998, the UK Government undertook to explore the scope for achieving more widespread availability of the Irish language television station, Teilifis na Gaeilige (TG4) in Northern Ireland. The UK Government  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS145"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fulfilled this commitment by the construction of a new transmitter at Divis. This, combined with the analogue overspill signal from transmitters in Ireland, means that TG4 is currently available on a free-to-air basis to approximately 60 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1012203000018"></a>Once the analogue signals in Northern Ireland and Ireland are switched off by the end of 2012, arrangements need to be put in place to enable TG4 to be received in a digital form. In this context, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Irish and UK Governments in February 2010, committing them to working together on the technical arrangements for post-switchover provision of TG4. The two Governments are pleased with the amount of progress made since the signing of the MoU in ensuring and expanding the provision of Irish television services, including Irish language services, in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1012203000019"></a>Following a broad range of technical work, the two Governments have now agreed that the most effective way to provide for the continuing provision of TG4 is by building a new, low-power TV multiplex in Northern Ireland. In addition to carrying TG4, this multiplex, which will be part of the UK DTT system, will also carry RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2. It is hoped that this will further increase the coverage of these channels in Northern Ireland, enabling approximately 90 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland to receive their services on a free-to-air basis, either through overspill as before or via the new multiplex.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1012203000020"></a>The existing analogue signals will be switched off on a co-ordinated basis in Ireland and Northern Ireland at the end of 2012 and much more work needs to be done between then and now. Digital UK, the not-for-profit organisation that is leading the digital switchover in the UK, will be ensuring that viewers in Northern Ireland have all the necessary information to help them make the switch to digital and know what sort of equipment to buy if they want to receive these services.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1012203000021"></a>Other arrangements that need to be put in place include the establishment of a joint venture between RTÉ and TG4 to run the multiplex which will be licensed under the UK's Wireless Telegraphy Act of 2006 by Ofcom at the request of the UK Government. This will be a not-for-profit company. In addition, the licensee will have to put out to competitive tender all the elements of the multiplex operation which are contestable and the multiplex will be operated on a not-for-profit and open-book basis.</p>

Last week I met the working group established to conduct the review and we agreed a set of high-level findings and next steps. This group included members of the motorcycle industry, trainers, riders' representatives, road safety and local authority  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS146"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bodies as well as DSA and DfT officials. I will be placing the report on the department's website <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a> and in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1012203000024"></a>While there is more work to be done on the detail, the review has helpfully identified a set of changes to the test which have the potential to deliver my objectives for a new motorcycle test. My goal is to see the practical test delivered as a single on-road event in a way which will maintain riding standards, protect safety and increase accessibility of the test to all candidates. The work delivered by the group includes a new hazard avoidance manoeuvre which-subject to further trialling-can be carried out on the road, as well as ways to perform the other specified manoeuvres on the road. The working group has also suggested that the slow manoeuvres (manual handling, slalom, figure of eight, U turn and slow ride) might better be examined at training centres, ahead of the main test, by delegated examiners employed by the training industry. It could be followed by a single-event, on-road test conducted by DSA, including the remaining manoeuvres and the other elements of the road-based test. This approach needs further development with the training industry.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1012203000025"></a>The next step for the review will be to hold wider trials, with test-level candidates, to verify the standards, suitability and safety of the new manoeuvres, including a number of on-road sites, to establish the criteria for safe on-road testing. This will be followed by public consultation on the proposed changes. We will aim to implement a new test by the end of 2011 or early 2012, including on-road testing initially in priority areas which are poorly served by the current network of off-road test centres. Any changes to the manoeuvres would be implemented for all tests at all locations. Subject to further work on safety, cost and value for money, there would be a phased introduction of on-road testing, moving to general adoption as soon as possible. Changes to the test will need to be monitored and kept under review to ensure that the review objectives are delivered in practice.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="1012203000045"></a>Many households across the UK without access to the natural gas grid rely on deliveries of heating oil  to heat their homes. Heating oil is also used by smaller commercial customers, notably with demand focused in the agricultural sector.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="1012203000046"></a>Overall, UK heating oil demand is around 3.7 million tonnes per year with domestic demand accounting for some 60 per cent. Demand is seasonal, with around two-thirds of heating oil consumed between October and March.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="1012203000047"></a>The recent severe weather has significantly disrupted the distribution of heating oil to customers across the UK, particularly, but not only, in Scotland. The severe weather, notably low temperatures and heavy snow, has caused considerable disruption to road networks, which has affected suppliers' ability to make deliveries particularly to more remote areas away from the strategic road network. This has resulted in delivery backlogs, which suppliers have been working hard, in difficult circumstances, to reduce.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="1012203000048"></a>There are around 200 fuel distributors in the UK, which work hard throughout the year to supply their customers. Many of these companies are small businesses, some with perhaps only two or three delivery vehicles. A tanker will make an average of 16 domestic deliveries per day covering some 180 miles to make these deliveries. The bulk of the time in making a delivery is taken up  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS149"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the travel between the vehicle's base and the customer and between customers. Some larger suppliers hold their own stocks at smaller depots but others pick up from fuel terminals "off rack", purchasing product on the spot market. Modern road tankers deliver fuel to the customer's storage tank via a dedicated fuel delivery system.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="1012203000049"></a>Tackling this backlog is challenging for the industry at a time when, due to the cold weather, it has been facing significantly higher demand than is usual at this time of year. This challenge has been exacerbated by delays to deliveries due to the state of the road network in parts of the UK and customers bringing forward deliveries that would usually have been made in the new year. However, prompt action to relax regulations on drivers' hours has enabled drivers to work for longer each day making more deliveries and helping to manage the backlog.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="1012203000050"></a>Distributors are doing all that they can to prioritise deliveries to vulnerable customers and those running short on fuel. Working with DECC, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers has issued a voluntary code of practice to its members to help them to prioritise orders to those most in need. We are also putting in place arrangements with distributors, through the relevant trade associations, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers and UK Liquid Petroleum Gas, for distributors to alert local authorities when they are aware of a risk that potentially vulnerable households will run short of heating oil. Similarly, we have asked local authorities and other local responders to be aware of these risks and, taking account of local circumstances, to consider what assistance they can provide to potentially vulnerable households who may need support over the Christmas and new year period.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="1012203000051"></a>Hospitals do not tend to use heating oil, although a reducing number of NHS organisations are reliant on gas oil for stand-by use, fuel for generators, boiler maintenance or dual-fuel needs. Hospitals normally operate with higher levels of fuel reserves at this time of year and, at present, we understand that there are no reported problems owing to a lack of gas oil deliveries to NHS trusts.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="1012203000052"></a>The severe weather has also led to a very high forecast of demand for gas today. Last night this led National Grid to issue a day-ahead gas balancing alert for Monday 20 December at 6.28 pm. The GBA trigger level for today (20 December) is set at 452.40 million cubic metres. National Grid currently expects demand for the day will be 461.57 million cubic metres (though it should be noted that this figure is constantly updated). This figure is 97 million cubic metres above the normal seasonal demand (more than 26 per cent). The fact that expected demand was higher than the trigger level obliged National Grid to issue the GBA.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="1012203000053"></a>The gas balancing alert (GBA) is a tool that National Grid uses to make sure that there is enough gas in the system. The GBA has the effect of signalling:</p>
to shippers to increase supplies on to the network, eg by increasing flows through imports and releasing gas from storage; and,

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="1012203000054"></a>As such GBAs are simply a part of the portfolio of mechanisms that help the market to operate effectively. When each of the GBAs was issued last winter, the market responded well, closing any potential gap between supply and demand by bringing on additional supplies and reducing demand from large users. There is currently no expectation of any disruption to domestic customers or to commercial customers unless they have interruptible contracts in place. That said, we are never complacent about security of supply and National Grid continues to keep us informed as the situation develops. We are making changes through the Energy Bill to further improve the security of gas supply, by conferring powers on Ofgem to sharpen commercial incentives for the effective management of low-probability high-impact events.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="1012203000055"></a>The issuance of a gas balancing alert by National Grid today is also a reminder of the significant efforts being made by system and network operators, shippers, suppliers, storage operators and other participants in the gas market to deliver sufficient gas to meet the heightened demand brought on by the current severe weather.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="1012203000057"></a>I would like to inform the House about recent developments on the FiReControl Project. This is the third part of the last Government's resilience programme and set out to replace the standalone control rooms in England's Fire and Rescue Services with a national network of nine control centres. The aim was to improve national resilience, interoperability and efficiency as well as to enhance the technology available to the Fire and Rescue Service.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="1012203000058"></a>Many honourable Members will be aware that, for some time, the project has experienced delays and delivery problems. The progress of the project has caused serious concern, and so in June this year I made it clear to the main FiReControl contractor, Cassidian, (formerly EADS Defence &amp; Security), that the main IT system must now be delivered to time, cost and quality. At this point, we activated a key milestone in its contract requiring the main IT system to be completed in three control centres by mid-2011. We told Cassidian that no additional taxpayers' money could be invested in this project, nor would delivery of a system of reduced quality or functionality be acceptable.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="1012203000059"></a>Following extensive discussion with Cassidian, we have jointly concluded, with regret, that the requirements of the project cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe. Therefore, the best outcome for the taxpayer and the fire and rescue community is for the contract

Cassidian and the Department for Communities and Local Government have reached an acceptable settlement over this, although the details will remain commercially confidential.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="1012203000060"></a>I know many people in the Fire and Rescue Service and in fire and rescue authorities have devoted considerable time and expertise to this project, especially those who have served on governance and working groups, directors of the local authority-controlled companies, advisers from the Chief Fire Officers' Association, Fire and Rescue Service secondees to the project and other staff involved from the fire and rescue community, and many technical and resilience experts. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all these people for their contribution.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="1012203000061"></a>Over the next few weeks we intend to identify the extent to which any legacy assets from the project, including the control centre buildings, can be used for the benefit of the Fire and Rescue Service and local communities in future. We will also be making arrangements for maintaining products already delivered.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="1012203000062"></a>The department will cease funding activities directly associated with the project as quickly as is compatible with organising an orderly closing down of the project. We recognise that fire and rescue authorities will now wish to review their control arrangements in the light of today's decision. This Government do not intend to impose any solution for the future of control room services. We will, however, start to consult the fire and rescue sector soon on how best the Government can support it, if at all, in developing alternative plans based on the principles of localism, ensuring public safety, building up national resilience and delivering value for taxpayers' money. These continue to be our overriding priorities.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="1012203000063"></a>I know that the uncertainty around the future of this project has been frustrating and unsettling for the fire and rescue community and those closely concerned with their interests. My objective has been to deliver operational certainty for the Fire and Rescue Service and financial certainty for the taxpayer. Today's decision will deliver that objective and I will continue to keep the House informed of progress.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="1012203000065"></a>I am announcing today the Government's publication of <I>Implementing Fulfilling and Rewarding Lives</I>, guidance for local authorities and NHS organisations to secure implementation of the autism strategy. I launched this guidance at a conference convened by the National Autistic Society on 17 December 2010. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library. Copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office and to noble Lords from the Printed Paper Office. This statutory guidance has been published in fulfilment of the requirements in the Autism Act 2009 that the  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS152"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State publish a strategy on services for adults with autism in England by 1 April 2010, and issue statutory guidance no later than 31 December 2010.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="1012203000066"></a>The strategy <I>Fulfilling and Rewarding Lives</I> was published on 3 March 2010. This Government have made a very clear and firm commitment to drive forward work to tackle the disadvantage which people with autism and their families sadly so often face, and to step up the pace to deliver that strategy. The purpose of this guidance is to secure the implementation of the <I>Fulfilling and Rewarding Lives</I> strategy. It gives guidance to local authorities, NHS bodies and NHS foundation trusts on issues set out in the Autism Act. This guidance will help these bodies to develop services that support and meet the locally identified needs of people with autism and their families and carers, and enable local transparency and accountability.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="1012203000067"></a>As set out in Section 3 of the Autism Act, this guidance is to be treated as though it were guidance issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Service Act 1970 (LASS Act). This means that local authorities must "follow the path charted by the guidance, with liberty to deviate from it where the authority judges on admissible grounds that there is good reason to do so, but without freedom to take a substantially different course". Though the LASS Act does not directly apply to NHS bodies, the Autism Act makes clear that for the purposes of this guidance "an NHS body is to be treated as if it were a local authority within the meaning of the LASS Act".</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="1012203000068"></a>The guidance focuses on the key areas required by the Act, in each case identifying what health and social services bodies are already expected to do, and setting out any additional requirements introduced by the strategy. An underlying principle is to avoid new burdens. This guidance has been informed by an extensive consultation on draft guidance between July and October this year. The Secretary of State has a duty, under the Autism Act, to keep the strategy under review: as part of this, the guidance will also remain under review and will be updated as required.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="1012203000075"></a>This Government are committed to ensuring that new-build homes post-2016 do not add extra carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, while ensuring that the costs of building new homes do not prevent appropriate and sustainable development.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="1012203000076"></a>We have confirmed that the national regulatory requirements will include a high level of energy efficiency, which has been incorporated into a revised Code for Sustainable Homes, to encourage practical experience. In July, we asked the Zero Carbon Hub to advise on the national benchmark standard for on-site measures. I have now received the Hub's initial findings; I am grateful for the work of the Hub with developers, green groups and other partners on this study. This is an important piece of work which will help us shape final decisions on the regulatory thresholds. We will also need to take account of decisions on the Renewable

We will announce our conclusions next year.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="1012203000077"></a>Localities can already plan for zero carbon development today, using powers in the Planning and Energy Act 2008, where it is reasonable to do so and is consistent with national planning policy, including relevant requirements on feasibility and viability, and relevant regulation. Many local authorities are already demonstrating their desire to drive performance in this area.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="1012203000078"></a>Many interested parties have argued for a community energy fund, enabling zero carbon to be met partly through contributions to a fund used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, allowing developers to meet their carbon obligations cost-effectively. In this respect, the recently confirmed Community Infrastructure Levy provides a mechanism for local authorities to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions locally, through investment in local renewable energy infrastructure that supports development in their area. It will be important that any approach operates in a way that demonstrates transparently that real carbon savings are achieved. We will now work with local authorities and industry on how best to do that.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="1012203000079"></a>It will be important that people are able to take the best decision for their area. We recently launched Community Energy Online to support local authorities and others who want to introduce local energy schemes. We will also work to incorporate material on local energy planning into a local standards framework, providing accessible, robust options to underpin local choice.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="1012203000080"></a>New homes are an important part of new development, but not the whole picture. I can announce that we will follow a similar process for new non-domestic buildings as for new homes. The Government's policy is progressively to raise the national regulatory requirements for non-domestic buildings between now and 2019, enabling them to be zero carbon from 2019. We will maintain consistency between the domestic and non-domestic frameworks as far as it is practical, but will consider taking a different approach on some elements, where the diversity of the non-domestic stock or the nature of the commercial market justifies that. We are today publishing on the department's website the findings of the consultation exercise on policy options for zero carbon new non-domestic buildings that was concluded earlier this year.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="1012203000081"></a>We are currently undertaking detailed technical work to underpin the development of future national regulatory standards. We expect also that off-site measures could be supported using the same approaches as for homes, and will investigate this possibility further so it will be open for local areas to use a community energy fund through the Community Infrastructure Levy to achieve the zero carbon standard for non-domestic buildings should they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="1012203000082"></a>In future our homes-indeed, all our buildings-will need to be cleaner, greener and cheaper to run. This Government will continue to deliver the tools to make this a reality.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="1012203000102"></a>I am today publishing the department's work plan on major infrastructure planning reform. This Government believe that securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to deliver sustainable growth over the coming decades and is an integral part of our efforts to rebuild the UK economy and to provide new jobs. We cannot expect to meet the needs of tomorrow with yesterday's infrastructure and we cannot secure essential investment without a planning system designed to meet this need. The work plan sets out the steps that we are taking to deliver this reform.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="1012203000103"></a>It is right that decisions on infrastructure of national importance should be taken by democratically elected representatives and not by an unelected quango. The Localism Bill therefore provides a legislative framework for the abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) and the creation of a major infrastructure planning unit (MIPU) in a new, more streamlined and efficient planning inspectorate. The MIPU will be responsible for examining applications for major infrastructure development and providing high-quality advice to Ministers.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="1012203000104"></a>For the majority of schemes, decisions will be taken by the Secretary of State responsible for the policy: the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change will take decisions on major energy infrastructure and the Secretary of State for Transport will take decisions on major transport infrastructure.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS158"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="1012203000105"></a>We envisage that applications relating to hazardous waste will be determined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and that applications relating to waste water and water supply will be determined jointly by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. This is in line with the position prior to the establishment of the IPC.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="1012203000106"></a>The Government are determined to ensure that a return to ministerial decision-making does not mean  a return to slow and protracted consideration of applications. It supports the fast-track approach established through the 2008 Planning Act-that is to say that decisions will be taken within 12 months of commencement of an application's examination. We will set up a ministerial group to oversee the effectiveness of the regime and explore whether additional efficiencies can be made to speed up the process further.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="1012203000107"></a>The work plan confirms the Government's intention to press ahead with the development of national policy statements and indicates a timetable for their production and designation. The Government have made clear their position on additional runways at London's three major airports; their priority is to create a sustainable framework for UK aviation rather than to produce a national policy statement at this time.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="1012203000108"></a>National policy statements should have the strongest possible democratic mandate and, subject to the passage of the Localism Bill, they will in future be subject to approval of the House of Commons following parliamentary scrutiny by the House of Commons, the House of Lords or a Joint Committee of both Houses. For those national policy statements that are currently subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, it is the Government's intention to adopt a similar, informal approach for parliamentary approval to that set out in the Localism Bill.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="1012203000109"></a>National policy statements will continue to be the primary documents by which decisions are made on schemes that fall within the 2008 Planning Act regime for major infrastructure. Decisions must be made in accordance with them, although the Secretary of State will also have to take into account any other matters considered both important and relevant to the decision. Those matters can include policy contained within the new national planning policy framework, on which I have made a separate Statement to the House today.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS159"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="1012203000112"></a>The coalition agreement states that the Government will publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework that covers all forms of development and sets out national economic, environmental and social priorities.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="1012203000113"></a>The planning system is vital to the rebuilding of Britain's economy. We need to reinvigorate our construction and development industries and the investment that goes with them and to ensure that we develop and protect our national assets. We need a planning system that encourages the idea that development can positively benefit a community. We need a planning system that enables local people to shape their surroundings in a way that, while heeding national objectives and constraints, is also sensitive to the history and character of a given location. We need participation and social engagement enabling communities to formulate a positive vision of their future development.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="1012203000114"></a>The Localism Bill sets out a legislative framework for achieving these goals.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="1012203000115"></a>The Government have made it clear that, with the exception of nationally important projects, planning should be a local matter. The role of central government is to determine and define environmental, economic and social priorities for the country and to design a planning system that helps to ensure a pattern of development that matches these priorities and local aspiration. This role is currently fulfilled through legislation and through the suite of planning policy guidance notes (PPGs) and minerals policy guidance notes (MPGs), and, more recently, planning policy statements (PPSs) and minerals policy statements (MPSs).</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="1012203000116"></a>These documents, which run to over 1,000 pages, set out central government policy on various aspects of development and land use to local planning authorities, which must legally have regard to them when drawing up their local development frameworks. They are also often relevant to making decisions on planning applications. They cover broad policy themes such as planning aspects of climate change, housing, renewable energy, flood risk, green belt and waste, as well as procedural themes such as how to compile local development plans.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="1012203000117"></a>The Government believe that the current suite of planning policy statements and guidance notes is too centralist in its approach and too long and cumbersome for councils and developers to use effectively. There is no overarching integrated statement of the Government's priorities for the country and the role that planning can play in delivering them.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="1012203000118"></a>Therefore, the Government will produce a simple national planning policy framework setting out their priorities for the planning system in England in a single, concise document covering all major forms of development proposals handled by local authorities. All the national planning policies set out in PPSs, MPSs, PPGs and MPGs will be integrated into a single document.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><a name="1012203000119"></a>The national planning policy framework will set out the Government's views on how the planning system in England can contribute to the delivery of a prosperous, competitive and attractive country based on the values of freedom, fairness and responsibility. The framework will set broad economic, environmental  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS160"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and social priorities and how they relate to each other, but will ensure that the majority of planning decisions are made at the local level, with the minimum of interference from Whitehall. The framework will also set out a strong basis for economic growth and a presumption in favour of sustainable development, as well as any further policy needed to establish and implement neighbourhood plans.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="1012203000120"></a>The Government will apply the following principles when considering what the framework should contain. The framework will be:</p>
localist in its approach, handing power back to local communities to decide what is right for them;used as a mechanism for delivering government objectives only where it is relevant, proportionate and effective to do so; anduser-friendly and accessible, providing clear policies on making robust local and neighbourhood plans and development management decisions. 
<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="1012203000121"></a>In the past, Governments have issued vast swathes of non-statutory guidance in addition to policy. However, such guidance can unintentionally take on a force that constrains rather than helps practitioners and users on the ground. This Government, therefore, believe that we should keep central government guidance to a minimum. Accordingly, the Government will radically reduce the amount of guidance that they issue and will work to withdraw or shorten existing guidance wherever they can.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="1012203000122"></a>The Government will publish and consult on a draft of the new national planning policy framework in 2011. We will invite Parliament to hold a Select Committee inquiry on the framework during the consultation period, so that it is subjected to additional democratic scrutiny.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="1012203000123"></a>For the time being, national policy statements (which are separate statutory documents published in accordance with the Planning Act 2008, setting out the Government's policy on major infrastructure projects such as nuclear power stations and ports) will not be included in the framework. Further detail on our approach to major infrastructure is set out in the work plan on major infrastructure planning reform, which I am also publishing today. Copies of the work plan have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the department's website: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/</a></p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="1012203000124"></a>This Government have a commitment to greater transparency and openness in developing their policy. To begin the process of writing the framework, therefore, and in advance of formal consultation on a draft, I invite organisations and individuals to offer their suggestions to the department on what priorities and policies we might adopt to produce a shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national planning policy framework. Details of how to do so have been placed on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. I would be pleased to receive proposals by 28 February 2011. The department will also organise a number of round-table discussions with key organisations to promote debate on the framework.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_16"></a>
<a name="1012203000125"></a><b><a name="101220-wms0001.htm_spmin11"></a><a name="1012203000521"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform (Mark Harper) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="1012203000126"></a>A bar on sentenced, serving prisoners voting was first put in place in 1870. Successive Governments have maintained the position that, when an individual breaks their contract with society by committing an offence that leads to imprisonment, they should lose the right to vote while they are incarcerated.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="1012203000127"></a>Five years ago, in a case known as Hirst (No.2), the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the existing statutory bar on convicted prisoners voting was contrary to Article 3, Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights-the right to free and fair elections. The Court ruled that barring convicted prisoners in detention pursued a legitimate aim, but that a blanket ban was not proportionate. In its judgment, the Court acknowledged that the right to vote under the First Protocol was not absolute, and that contracting states to the European Convention had to be given a margin of appreciation-a broad discretion-to decide what limitations on that right would be proportionate.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="1012203000128"></a>That judgment was handed down in October 2005. The last Government stated clearly and repeatedly that they would implement the judgment, published a timetable for legislation, and issued two consultation papers about how to do so. But they did nothing. The result is that the United Kingdom stands in breach of international law obligations-obligations that we expect others to uphold-and prisoners are bringing compensation claims as a direct result of the last Government's inaction.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="1012203000129"></a>In November 2010, the European Court of Human Rights handed down a further judgment against the UK, Greens and MT. In that judgment, the Court set a deadline for the introduction of legislation of August 2011. There are in the region of 2,500 claims before the European Court of Human Rights which have been suspended pending implementation. We have been given a window to act and it is right that we do so. If we do not, we only increase the risk of damages.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="1012203000130"></a>It is plain that there are strong views across Parliament and in the country on the question of whether convicted prisoners should be entitled to vote. However, this is not a choice: it is a legal obligation. So the Government are announcing today that we will act to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. In deciding how to proceed, we have been guided by three principles: first, that we should implement the Hirst judgment in a way that meets our legal obligations, but does not go further than that; secondly, that the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote; and, thirdly, that we should seek to prevent the taxpayer from having to face future claims for compensation.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="1012203000131"></a>The Government will therefore bring forward legislation providing that the blanket ban in the existing law will be replaced. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence  


<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS162"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of four years or more will lose the right to vote in all circumstances, which reflects the Government's clear view that more serious offenders should not retain the right to vote. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence of less than four years will retain the right to vote, but legislation will provide that the sentencing judge will be able to remove that right if they consider that appropriate. Four years has in the past been regarded as the distinction between short and long-term prisoners, and the Government consider that permitting prisoners sentenced to less than four years' imprisonment to vote is sufficient to comply with the judgment.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="1012203000132"></a>The right to vote will be restricted to UK Westminster Parliamentary and European Parliament elections only, and will not apply to other elections or referendums. That is the minimum currently required by the law (a case considering whether Article 3, Protocol 1 applies to elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently before the European Court of Human Rights: the Government's position is that it does not). Prisoners will vote by post or proxy, and will be entitled to register to vote not at the prison, but at their former address or the area where they have a local connection.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="1012203000133"></a>We believe that these proposals meet the objectives that we have set out of implementing the judgment in a way that is proportionate; ensuring the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote; and seeking to prevent future claims for compensation. We will bring forward legislation next year for Parliament to debate.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="1012203000134"></a>While the franchise is reserved for Westminster, the implementation of this policy will clearly have implications for Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the administration of justice is devolved. The Government will work closely with colleagues in the Scottish and Northern Ireland Administrations before legislation is introduced on the practical implications of the approach.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="1012203000135"></a>Governments have an absolute duty to uphold the rule of law, and at this of all times we must avoid risking taxpayers' money in ways that the public would rightly condemn. In the light of this, and of the legacy left by the last Government, the only responsible course is to implement the judgment, and to do so in a way which ensures the most serious offenders continue to lose the right to vote.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_17"></a>
<a name="1012203000136"></a><b><a name="101220-wms0001.htm_spmin12"></a><a name="1012203000522"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Baroness Wilcox):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Universities and Skills (David Willetts) has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="1012203000137"></a>The Haldane Principle means that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken by researchers themselves through peer review. This involves evaluating the quality, excellence and likely impact of science and research programmes. Prioritisation of an individual research council's spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers. The coalition Government support this principle as vital for the protection of academic independence and excellence. We all benefit from its application in the UK.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS163"></a><b>20 Dec 2010 : Column WS163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a><a name="1012203000138"></a>Over the years there has been some uncertainty over the interpretation of the Haldane Principle. After consulting senior figures in the science and research community, the Government now offer this further clarification. This Statement on the Haldane Principle applies to science and research which the Government fund through the research councils and national academies. HEFCE has statutory independence. The Haldane Principle does not apply to the research budgets of government departments, which are used to fund research to support their departmental policies and objectives. That said, departments work closely with the research councils to ensure that the research they fund is aligned with that funded by the science and research base and delivers maximum value to the taxpayer. More generally, research councils need to ensure that the views of those with an interest in the potential outcomes of the research are sought when setting their overall priorities.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="1012203000139"></a>The Government do, however, need to take a view on the overall level of funding to science and research and has decided to protect and to ring-fence the science and research budget for the next four years. This decision is evidence that the Government recognise the strategic importance of science and research to our future growth, prosperity, culture and heritage.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a><a name="1012203000140"></a>There are areas where Ministers should have no input: Ministers should not decide which individual projects should be funded nor which researchers should receive the money. This has been crucial to the international success of British science. At the other end of the spectrum, there are decisions that ultimately must be for Ministers, albeit informed by external advice; these include the overall size of the funding for science and research and its distribution between the research councils, the national academies and higher education research funding.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_120"></a><a name="1012203000141"></a>In addition, every Government will have some key national strategic priorities such as addressing the challenges of an ageing population, energy supply or climate change. The research base has an important role to play in addressing such priorities and the research councils, with the support of independent advice, have proposed research programmes to tackle them. It is also appropriate for Ministers to ask research councils to consider how best they can contribute to these priorities without crowding out other areas of their missions. But it is for the research councils to decide on the specific projects and people to fund within these priorities, free from ministerial interference.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_121"></a><a name="1012203000142"></a>Similarly, Ministers have a legitimate role in decisions that involve long-term and large-scale commitments of national significance. These include the construction of large research facilities, where Ministers have to approve business cases, and involvement in international research treaties. Public funding from the research councils for both these categories of research spending must be dedicated to supporting excellent research, irrespective of its geographical location. In many cases the location will be an obvious decision, given clusters of relevant research capability. Ministerial views on such business cases should be formed with the aid of advice from the research councils.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="1012203000143"></a>It is important that Ministers, where they are involved in making strategic decisions on the funding of research, take account of advice from a wide variety of expert sources including academia and industry, both nationally and internationally. The Government recognise the contribution to our national life and to the UK economy made by research and teaching in the full range of disciplines including physical sciences, social sciences, life sciences, environmental sciences, engineering and the arts and humanities.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a><a name="1012203000144"></a>The Government value the multiplicity and variety of sources of funding from the public, private and charitable sectors. These contribute to the provision of a rich and diverse environment supporting the research community across all disciplines. Overall, excellence is and must remain the driver of funding decisions, and it is only by funding excellent research that the maximum benefits will be secured for the nation.</p>

For the first time, HE research funding in England has been included within this ring-fence, providing overall stability and certainty to the research base.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="1012203000148"></a>Allocations for resource are set out in table 1, below, and allocations for capital are in table 2.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="1012203000149"></a>This Government are committed to efficiency, prioritisation and reform. We shall delay capital investment to maximise investment in research projects and in people undertaking research. The Government intend to announce during 2011 the allocation of funding to a small number of further projects on the 2010 large facilities roadmap</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_128"></a><a name="1012203000150"></a>Savings from improved efficiency will be recycled directly within the ring-fence. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will reform its quality-related (QR) funding for research with a greater focus on research excellence and reform higher-education innovation funding with a greater focus on business interaction.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_129"></a><a name="1012203000151"></a>Collaboration is one of the key themes of these allocations. There will be significant collaboration among research councils, and among universities, tackling issues of national importance, often working with  the TSB.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="1012203000152"></a>There will also be greater coherence among HEFCE and the research councils. For example, HEFCE and the research councils will work together so that support and incentives to bring universities and business closer together are delivered coherently.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="1012203000153"></a>These allocations provide funding for the arts, humanities and social sciences as well as STEM to pursue vital research. Outstanding researchers in all fields will be funded to pursue curiosity-driven work and to define their own areas of scholarship. We are also putting the new UK Space Agency on a firm footing.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="1012203000154"></a>The allocation will allow research councils, HEFCE and the national academies to maintain the flow of talented new researchers and maintain national capability. It will enable them to provide researchers with access to key large-scale research infrastructure, both here and abroad. Funding bodies will concentrate on research centres of proven excellence, with the critical mass to address national challenges and compete internationally and the expertise to collaborate with business.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para469"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_469"></a><a name="1012203000493"></a>The coalition Government are firmly committed to protecting the security of their citizens and to restoring and protecting civil liberties.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para470"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_470"></a><a name="1012203000494"></a>The UK, in common with many other EU member states and third countries, places considerable value on the collection and analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data (that data collected by carriers in the exercise of their business) for the purposes of combating terrorism and organised crime. The appropriate use of PNR data is vital in keeping the public safe.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para471"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_471"></a><a name="1012203000495"></a>In line with this view, the Government continue to press for an EU PNR directive that includes provision for intra-EU flights. The Government also believe that clear PNR agreements between the EU and third countries play a vital role in removing legal uncertainty for air carriers flying to those countries, and help ensure that PNR information can be shared quickly and securely with all necessary data protection safeguards in place where appropriate.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para472"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_472"></a><a name="1012203000496"></a>We are firmly committed to consistency in our approach to civil liberties and will seek to translate our domestic agenda to the EU level-purpose limitation; rigorous evidence-based arguments; the principles of necessity and proportionality; stringent data protection safeguards, especially when handling sensitive personal data; independent data protection oversight; and, of course, full compliance with EU law and the EU treaties.</p>

<a name="101220-wms0001.htm_para473"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_473"></a><a name="1012203000497"></a>On 21 September the European Commission (EC) published a Communication on the global approach to transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries (which proposed a set of common principles on sharing data with third countries) alongside a package of draft negotiating mandates for PNR agreements with Australia, Canada and the United States. In response to the Commission recommendations, on 18 October the Council presented a draft Council decision to authorise the Commission to open negotiations for PNR agreements with Australia, Canada and the US, together with draft negotiating guidelines (collectively referred to as negotiating mandates).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_474"></a><a name="1012203000498"></a>We fully recognise the importance of working with partners outside the EU, given that the threats we face are global in nature. Notably, we will continue to engage closely with the US on PNR and data protection, both of which are crucial to our ability to co-operate with the US on improving US and EU security. We will, though, ensure that the exchange of data with such partners remains subject to rigorous data protection safeguards. After due consideration of the importance of civil liberties, data protection and security concerns, the Government have decided to opt in to negotiating mandates for three PNR agreements with Australia, Canada and the US as they believe they will pave the way for EU-third country agreements that will strike the right balance between civil liberties, data protection and the security of the EU. As these mandates are currently restricted so as to preserve the EU negotiating position, they are not therefore depositable within Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_475"></a><a name="1012203000499"></a>The Government will continue to work with the scrutiny committees when considering whether to opt in to Council decisions to sign and conclude each third-country agreement. I will also in due course update Parliament on the Government's opt-in decisions at these later stages.</p>

EAM allows Ministers to activate special assistance

<p><a name="wms_stpa_477"></a><a name="1012203000502"></a>When the policy was first introduced in 2004, EAM could be awarded to any British victim of a terrorist incident abroad, regardless of whether or not the person had travel insurance. However, in June 2008 the Government at the time decided to impose restrictions on EAM eligibility, excluding those victims who did not have travel insurance. I have decided to overturn this decision and restore EAM for all British nationals affected by a terrorist attack overseas, regardless of whether they have travel insurance. Acts of terrorism are singularly heinous crimes, usually targeting innocent people at random. It is right that all British victims of terrorist attacks overseas can receive the same level of support from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_478"></a><a name="1012203000503"></a>EAM only covers incidents overseas that are deemed to be acts of terrorism by Her Majesty's Government. They do not replace travel insurance. British nationals travelling overseas are strongly advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance. Those that do not and are involved in accidents or incidents often deeply regret it when faced with huge bills.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_479"></a><a name="1012203000504"></a>Key elements of the Exceptional Assistance Measures are:</p>
the measures will only be activated as a last resort, where financial assistance is not made available through other means: i.e. from the Government of the country where the incident took place, insurance providers or other agencies and organisations, and in a situation we deem to be terrorist in nature;assistance under these measures will not be made available to those who have travelled to a country or region for which the FCO had advised against all travel;the measures do not cover medical care in the UK or long-term care in relation to conditions relating to the effects of the terrorist incident; andthese measures will be activated on a case-by-case basis by ministerial decision.

The review looked specifically at the conduct of senior individuals at the bank, the acquisition of ABN AMRO in 2007 and the 2008 capital raisings. The FSA conducted the review with assistance from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>

<a name="101220w0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="1012207000029"></a>On 2 December 2010 the FSA announced that a supervisory investigation had confirmed that RBS made a series of bad decisions in the years immediately before the financial crisis, most significantly the acquisition of ABN AMRO, and the decision to aggressively expand its investment banking business. However, the review concluded that these bad decisions were not the result of a lack of integrity by any individual. The FSA did not identify any instances of fraud or dishonest activity by RBS senior individuals, or a failure of governance on the part of the board.</p>

The former is being extended to men and women aged 70 to 75, the latter to women aged 47 to 73. Those above the upper age limit will continue to be able to self-refer for screening.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a><a name="1012207000107"></a>We are also introducing a new screening technology to the NHSBCSP programme: flexible sigmoidoscopy. This can detect abnormalities before they become cancer, as well as helping to detect cancer early. Experts estimate this technology will save around 3,000 lives a year. £60 million has been provided for a four-year rollout and, subject to the approval of the UK National Screening Committee, pilots will begin next year.</p>

In September, we announced that £9 million would be provided through the national awareness and early diagnosis initiative to support 59 local campaigns that will work to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of bowel, lung and breast cancers and to encourage early presentation at a general practitioner (GP) surgery. A further £1.75 million is being provided to pilot activity in two regions to test the viability of a possible national signs and symptoms campaign on bowel cancer.</p>

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has developed a guideline on the investigation and management of endometriosis for healthcare professionals and an associated patient information leaflet, both of which are available on the RCOG website.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_99"></a><a name="1012207000137"></a>The evidence relating to diagnosis and use of scans in endometriosis is discussed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline. Visual inspection of the pelvis at laparoscopy is the gold standard investigation to diagnose endometriosis. Compared with laparoscopy, transvaginal ultrasound has limited value in diagnosis except for confirming or excluding endometriotic ovarian cysts. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is a useful test to diagnose or exclude endometriosis compared with laparoscopy.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1012207000259"></a>"Devices used to stop operational functions of the appliance, if any, shall be distinguished from other manual devices by means of shape, or size, or surface texture, or position, etc. A tactile or an audible and visual feedback shall give an indication that the device has been operated".</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_179"></a><a name="1012207000247"></a>It will be published by the British Standards Institution within the next couple of months. Given the above requirements in BS EN 60335-1:2002 and the recent enhancement of BS EN 60335-2-6:2003 specifically for vulnerable groups, we will not be seeking to enhance the requirement in Clause 7.9 of BS EN 60335-1:2002 as indicated.</p>
