Some 3.5 million jobs in Britain are directly attributable to our membership of the EU, as is the fact that we receive over 25 per cent of all foreign direct investment coming into European countries.</p>

We are a significant beneficiary of being part of a larger, more prosperous and safer Europe. It creates jobs and trade and it gives consumers more choice and better prices. That is clearly in the national interest.</p>

Since we have a very significant trade deficit with the EU&#151;a deficit that has grown hugely in the last decade&#151;is it not true to say that there are more jobs in the EU dependent on trade with the UK than the other way round?</p>

But I repeat my assertion that the EU is a positive contributor to job creation in the UK and that is what matters to this country: people having jobs with secure employment prospects. I only wish that the Benches opposite could understand that.</p>

However, if we were concerned to increase infrastructure expenditure in the UK, does he agree that we could take a leaf out of the EU book&#151;namely, from the European Investment Bank&#151;and create a UK investment bank for long-term infrastructure expenditure that could attract funding both from institutions and from individuals?</p>

However, the EU, through the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is a significant source of support for infrastructure expenditure. This year, EIB funding to the UK will exceed &#163;3 billion, compared with &#163;2.2 billion last year, and is likely to increase to &#163;4.2 billion or so next year, largely as a result of the sterling efforts of my noble friends Lord Mandelson and Lord Davies. There are many cases where significant expenditure is taking place in the UK as a result of European support. I shall cite just one example. In my home county of Cornwall, the very exciting Wave Hub to create energy opportunities is being financed by European money.</p>

We shall be interested to hear the experiences of airlines which buy it. Meanwhile, our research is making progress, led by Cranfield University, to ascertain what substances, and in what concentrations, may be in cabin air during fume events. That information should help identify appropriate solutions if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="st_26"></a>

Is the Minister aware that since June 2000 I have been pressing Ministers in both Houses to take this issue a great deal more seriously than has previously been the case? However, Ministers seem to have been in perpetual denial about the seriousness of this in terms of the health and safety of both cabin crews and passengers. Will the Minister now accept that the decision by BAe would seem to indicate that it now takes this problem a great deal more seriously than it has in the past because it is investing money in these systems? Taken with the Breakspear research into fume contamination and the chronic medical effects on crews and passengers, will he now meet a deputation of those most directly affected with concerned Members of your Lordships&#146; House?</p>

However, he is quite wrong to imagine that the Government do not take it seriously. The Government responded to the report by the Committee on Toxicity in 2007, which said that the evidence was inconclusive and no connection between pilot ill health and cabin air could be proved or disproved, but that more research was needed. That was informed by BALPA as well. As a result the Cranfield study was set up, and we hope to get the first findings from that next year. We are not in any way complacent about the issue; we accept that some people experience unpleasant smells during the course of a flight and that there are occasional fume events that create those unpleasantnesses.</p>

Have the units been tested when there has been a contamination event? If so, has the output from the filters been characterised?</p>

<a name="91027-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09102776000030"></a>It is important that we know what is in a fume event when it takes place. The purpose behind the Cranfield study is, first of all, to establish whether there is anything there that needs to be dealt with. Until we know that, it would be premature for us to say that a particular filter was the right solution. We know that they remove volatile organic compounds, and they are very good at removing bacteria and viruses. We are also aware that organophosphates are present in hydraulic engine oil. We need to establish whether there is contamination from the engine oil into the cabin, and that is what the Cranfield study is looking into.</p>

<ul><a name="09102776000405"></a>&#147;a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds including benzene&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09102776000324"></a>and finishes by saying, &#147;including organophosphates&#148;. We know that organophosphates are extremely dangerous; Gulf War syndrome is one example of that, and we have seen shepherds affected by dipping their sheep. So why are the Government dithering when the health of tens of thousands of people is continually being affected by these events on commercial airlines?</p>

She is an experienced and well respected expert on aviation safety. The examination being conducted there is being done with the co-operation of airlines. It is the only work of its sort that is being conducted in the world, and that work is well over half-completed; we expect to get the findings next year. We do not yet have conclusive evidence that there are organophosphates that are harmful to health, but if that turns out to be the case then action will be taken straight away.</p>

The most recent figures for 2008 show that 97 contaminated air events were reported to the CAA out of 1.2 million passenger and cargo flights by UK carriers. Twelve pilots out of 20,000 have lost medical clearance for reasons that they attribute to cabin air. With regard to passengers, out of 29,000 complaints put to the Air Transport Users Council since January 2001, one has related to air quality.</p>

It is indeed the case that consumers should be able to choose lower or higher-strength wines. However, it is not for the Government to decide what products retailers should make available.

My noble friend&#146;s second point related to taxation. I can say with some accuracy that that is above my pay grade and is a matter for the Chancellor.</p>

Is the Minister aware that only from this month has the industry been permitted by EU regulations to reduce the alcoholic strength of wine for sale in Europe, but only by up to 2 per cent? Will the Government support the industry&#146;s campaign to relax the rules further so that more lower-strength wines can be marketed legally in the UK?</p>

The 2008 wine reform allowed EU producers access to wine-making rules used by third countries and new technologies used internationally, but, as she said, only to reduce alcohol in their wine by up to 2 per cent. We see this as an important development. I am pleased to tell the noble Baroness that we will continue to work within the EU to increase the scope for dealcoholisation of wines. Unfortunately, not all in the European Union favour these developments, because new technologies are seen as betraying traditions of European wine-making. So we have to recognise that old and new skills have to live side by side and that people must get every opportunity to improve their competitiveness in this market.</p>

What is the department doing to encourage pubs to serve wine in 125 millilitre glasses&#151;small glasses&#151;so that people who want to enjoy a glass of wine and stay within the limits can do so safely?</p>

Wine glass sizes are larger than they used to be, and the majority of pubs, bars and clubs now offer 175 millilitre or even 250 millilitre glasses by default. That makes it difficult to moderate intake, and it may influence less healthy drinking norms. The important matter is that customers should be able to go to pubs and clubs and should be able to ask for wine in the 125 millilitre measures. We are very concerned about that and are having a consultation with the Home Office about a mandatory code for retailers to do precisely that.</p>

Today we return to an issue raised in Committee by my noble friend Lady Turner: the continuing problem of poor take-up of council tax benefit among pensioners. We have listened to the debate and examined the evidence&#151;for example, the research provided for the Return to Rationing? campaign led by the Royal British Legion. We accept that many of the ex-service community aged over 65 would find it easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle if they took up their entitlement to the financial support available to them. In particular, as I am sure noble Lords are well aware, the Royal British Legion has focused on the impact that a simple name change&#151;from council tax benefit to council tax rebate&#151;could have on both take-up of the entitlement and, more widely, pensioner poverty.</p>

<a name="91027-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09102776000072"></a>I pay tribute to my noble friend, who has an amendment to move after this, and to the Royal British Legion for all its dignified efforts in highlighting this important issue. Improving the take-up of such entitlements as council tax benefit and pension credit is a key component of our strategy to ensure that pensioners in Britain no longer live in poverty. The Government have taken real action to tackle pensioner poverty, helping 900,000 pensioners out of poverty since 1998, but we know that we need to do more and are committed to doing so.</p>

<a name="91027-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09102776000073"></a>In Committee there was considerable support from all sides of your Lordships&#146; House for a name change along the lines suggested by my noble friend. As promised, the Government considered all the arguments carefully over the summer. Having done so, we agree that a name change, from council tax benefit to council tax rebate, would reflect the true nature of the benefit. A change has the potential to improve the take-up of this important entitlement. We respect that many pensioners, for various reasons, are reluctant to claim a benefit, despite the fact that council tax benefit is, in essence, a rightful reduction in the council tax that they are liable to pay, and despite the fact that claiming it could help to lift them out of poverty. This is something on which the Government intend to act. We believe that we should do whatever we can to remove any obstacles to claiming a rightful entitlement. Indeed, we are the first Government to mount a major programme of take-up activity across pensioner benefits. As such, I am very happy to state that the Government intend to make this name change to &#147;council tax rebate&#148;. I wish to put that clearly on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09102776000074"></a>As we made clear in Committee, though, the introduction of a name change is not a trivial matter for the 380 local authorities that administer the benefit. There are practical administrative implications and potentially significant costs to central and local government; for example, in making changes to IT and references to the benefit in all manner of forms and leaflets. We need to get this change right and therefore need to carry out further work to better understand how best to go about doing so and the implications. We will work closely with local authorities and key partners such as the Royal British Legion and Age Concern to carry out this work as swiftly as possible. Given the need for this further work, though, I am afraid that we can neither make the name change in this Bill nor set the precise timetable for doing so. The amendment we have tabled therefore provides an order-making power which will allow a name change to be made quickly once we have completed the additional work needed.</p>

<a name="91027-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09102776000075"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the Delegated Powers Committee reported on the amendment before us. While content with the delegation in principle, the committee had concerns with the proposed arrangements for parliamentary control. As drafted, the power would be subject to affirmative procedure on its first exercise, and thereafter subject to negative procedure. The committee recommended that any order which changes the name of the benefit should be subject to affirmative procedure. It is not the Government's intention to chop and change their mind by choosing one name and then another. However, I am very happy to undertake to come back at Third Reading with a further short amendment to implement the committee's recommendation.</p>

<a name="91027-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09102776000076"></a>I know that this amendment does not fully meet our shared desire for this change to be made straightaway; neither does my noble friend&#146;s amendment, which we will consider shortly. I hope that the amendment we have tabled and the strong commitment that we intend to make this change, and to do so as quickly as possible, are reassuring to my noble friend, all noble Lords and the Royal British Legion. I beg to move.</p>

When I first saw the amendment, I was not very happy with it as I thought that it was not positive enough. I have been in touch with the Royal British Legion, which has issued briefing to me and, I believe, to other Members of the House. As far as I can see, all the amendment does is to commit to a change at some time in the future, but not necessarily immediately. It does not say what name would replace the term &#147;benefit&#148;. My noble friend rightly says that some veterans do not claim the benefit to which they are entitled because they do not want to claim a benefit. The British legion has made extensive inquiries, done a lot of research and holds the view that changing the name of the benefit to &#147;rebate&#148; would result in a large number of people claiming it who do not now do so. Therefore, the legion thought that Amendment 63 would be the simplest way to deal more immediately with the problems that these veterans and many pensioners have as regards

As the Minister said, the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, also deserves congratulations on bringing this issue to the attention of your Lordships. The Royal British Legion has been highlighting for some time the peculiar case of the benefit that is really a rebate. If the simple process of changing the description from benefit to rebate allows more pensioners to feel able to take up what they are rightfully owed, we welcome this as an important step to cutting pensioner poverty. We are pleased to take on trust what the Minister said about the commitment to making this change. My right honourable friend David Cameron has pledged to support this change, and I will be pleased to inform him of what is effectively cross-party support for the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09102776000081"></a>I am sure, although I would not expect the Minister to admit it, that the change is probably the result of a titanic struggle in the Treasury, between that part that has to look after pensioner poverty targets and those who jealously guard the coffers. I am delighted that the Minister was on the winning side, and in this case the right side, of the battle. I hear what he said about the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s recommendations, and I am prepared to accept the consequent changes at Third Reading. With those remarks I, and we, reiterate our support for the amendment.</p>

The department must not think that, because it is renaming the benefit, suddenly people are going to run into the arms of the local authority and start making claims afresh without further campaigns at a national and a local level. That work goes on from time to time, and my experience is that the department tackles these things in waves. Sometimes a campaign is being run over a period of time and you can check its effectiveness.</p>

Council tax is going to become much more of a burden on low-income households over the next three to five years. In our innermost hearts we all know this. Any Government of whichever stripe&#151;or the department or the local authorities that are in charge of this&#151;should take the opportunity of the change to run a sustained campaign of public take-up, irrespective of what the benefit is called: otherwise, in the next three to five years, council tax will become a real burden for many low-income families.</p>

He is absolutely right that, in itself, it is not all that we need to do. We have heard powerful arguments about take-up campaigns, so I will not use the time of the House to run through them. The aim is to enable people to make one claim with one phone call for council tax benefit and housing benefit. There will be home visits, and we have provisions in the Bill to use data to reach people more effectively. Those efforts must continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09102776000088"></a>Let me make clear what I intend to do at Third Reading. The amendment that I proposed to bring forward has regard to the recommendation of the Delegated Powers Committee. At present, the power in the amendment will be subject to the affirmative procedure on first use, and negative procedure on second use, if there should be one. The Delegated Powers Committee recommended that the procedure should be affirmative throughout, and we will accept that recommendation. I did not propose&#151;and would not wish to mislead my noble friend Lady Turner or the noble Countess, Lady Mar, by suggesting&#151;that we would do anything further at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09102776000089"></a>I will stress one point that we may revisit when discussing the next amendment of my noble friend Lady Turner. The option of simply putting a name change in the Bill does not have the immediate effect of changing council tax benefit to council tax rebate. Any such provision would need to be subject to commencement provisions. Under the Bill, those provisions are commenced when the Secretary of State judges that it is appropriate to do so. Moreover, the Secretary of State would commence them under a commencement order, which is not a parliamentary process and would not be subject to the affirmative procedure. The fact that an alternative name is written in the Bill does not mean that things would happen straightaway&#151;the procedure would have to be introduced in a commencement order by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09102776000090"></a>That is a parallel situation to introducing and using the power that we have in the amendment. The powers that we have in the Bill around commencement orders would enable transitional provisions to be brought forward, and would enable adjustments to secondary legislation, but they would not enable adjustments to primary legislation. There is a raft of secondary and primary legislation containing the term &#147;council tax benefit&#148;. Perhaps here I am pre-empting the debate that we will have later. The amendment would not be sufficient to enable us to do everything to introduce the change that we all want. It says nothing about how expeditiously the change could be made. There is probably a lot of legislation for which the Secretary of State has not commenced provisions. There is no compulsion on the Secretary of State to take this route.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09102776000091"></a>Therefore, I honestly do not believe that it is as effective a route as the one that we have outlined in these provisions. I believe that these measures give the Royal British Legion what it wants&#151;and, indeed, what we all want&#151;in a way that is, with great respect, more effective than the amendment that we are about to debate. Perhaps we will come back to that shortly. I am grateful for the support for this amendment and believe that we have a shared view of what we want to achieve.</p>

However, it seems that the text of his amendment does not go quite far enough. Indeed, I have been in touch with the Royal British Legion about the text and that is also its view. It thinks that the Government&#146;s wording will not have a very immediate effect, whereas with the change that it recommends, as suggested in this amendment, there would be a chance of an immediate effect in the legislation, which is what the Legion is anxious to achieve.</p>

That is very important. Despite what has been said by the Minister and despite the support given for his Amendment 62, I do not see why we could not give some indication that what we were really after was the wording in Amendment 63. If that were on the record, it would clearly indicate to everyone that it is believed that veterans should be able to have their money via a rebate rather than a benefit. According to the research that the Legion has conducted, that would make an enormous difference to a lot of pensioners, many of whom are in relatively poor circumstances, and it would be of enormous benefit to a large number of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09102776000100"></a>I shall start with the question raised by the noble Countess, Lady Mar, about what is different here from how we dealt with, for example, incapacity benefit and changed the arrangements to the employment and support allowance. That was done through a detailed legislative process. The noble Countess will recall that we had lots of debates in Committee and in your Lordships&#146; House. It was a full journey to deal with that legislation. I emphasise that simply putting a name change in the Bill in the way suggested of itself does not achieve anything. With those provisions there we would need to move further. We would need arrangements by which those provisions are commenced. Simply because they are proposed, as my noble friend suggests, does not mean that they will have immediate effect. Other things need to happen for them to come into effect.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09102776000101"></a>I reiterate that it is not just a question of dealing with the general power of changing the name from council tax benefit to council tax rebate. There is a whole raft of other administrative, secondary and primary provisions that have the name in them which would have to be addressed. There is not provision in the Bill if the amendment were accepted to cover all those issues. I urge noble Lords to accept that doing it by way of the power that we have taken is a better process because it is subject to wider parliamentary scrutiny. In each case we have to work with local authorities and the British Legion. A lot of administrative work goes on behind all this&#151;300-odd local authorities administer council tax.</p>

I think it would be possible to do it from the beginning of the next financial year, which is a full six-month period. If he were able to give some indication to the House about how long it might take, he might have an easier ride in persuading the House that the amendment is flawed.</p>

There are costs involved in changing IT systems; it is not straightforward. Whatever my answer to that would have been, in a sense it is the same whether you do it by way of power in the fuller way that we suggested in our amendment, or by the Secretary of State having to apply a commencement order but with lack of powers to deal with all the stuff that should surround it. That is the difference.</p>

As noble Lords will recall, during our debates in Committee I reaffirmed the Government&#146;s commitment to align adult community care services with the right to control in the trailblazers. We made that commitment clear in the welfare reform White Paper. Adult community care services were excluded in the legislation to avoid duplicating existing community care and direct payments legislation.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09102776000108"></a>During Committee, we listened carefully to the concerns noble Lords raised, and I recognised the importance of making clear in this Bill our original policy intent of aligning adult community care with the right to control in the trailblazers. That is why during the summer months we worked closely with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and RADAR to develop this legislation. I believe that moving the exclusion for the purposes of the pilots effectively strikes the balance between putting in the Bill our commitment to alignment without compromising existing community care legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09102776000109"></a>We have developed these amendments in co-production with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and RADAR, and I thank them for the work they undertook with us to enable these amendments to be tabled.

Without that input, we would not be where we are heading today. I am also delighted that the amendments have attracted support across the parties&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, have put their names to the changes and demonstrated the cross-party commitment that exists for this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09102776000110"></a>Turning to the amendments, there are three components that I believe are central to meeting the concerns raised here in Committee and also in the other place. First, Amendment 72 inserts Clause 36(3A) which removes the exclusion of adult community care services for the purposes of the pilot schemes. This is entirely in line with our original policy intent to test the effectiveness of alignment through the trailblazers.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09102776000111"></a>Secondly, Amendment 73, which inserts a new clause after Clause 39, explicitly refers to the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to issue directions under existing community care legislation. This is a key component because we can achieve the delivery of alignment through directions under existing enactments. Alignment means delivering the effect of the right to control to individuals in receipt of adult community care services.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09102776000112"></a>Thirdly, Amendment 73 includes an order-making power that would enable the removal of the full exclusion of community care services at a later date, without recourse to primary legislation. A decision whether to remove the exclusion of community care services will be made once the trailblazers have been evaluated, and in line with decisions relating to wider rollout.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09102776000113"></a>As we discussed during Committee, a decision will be taken on whether to extend the right to control based on the evidence from the trailblazers, in particular whether the trailblazers deliver better outcomes for individuals, better value for money for the taxpayer and are affordable. The Law Commission&#146;s work on providing a clearer, more cohesive legal framework for adult social care will also be taken into account.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09102776000114"></a>Community care is a matter which is devolved in both Scotland and Wales. Therefore the power to decide whether the exclusion of community care in relation to Scotland and Wales should be permanently removed will rest with the Scottish and Welsh Ministers, respectively.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09102776000115"></a>The amendments demonstrate our commitment to alignment but take account of the Law Commission&#146;s ongoing review of the legislation covering adult social care. They make clear the Government&#146;s intention to deliver the significant improvements that disabled people are looking for in joined-up self-directed support. I beg to move.</p>

While many of us were having our summer holidays, the Minister and his officials were working&#151;day and night, I am sure&#151;over the summer with disabled people to bring back government amendments that truly reflect the aims and ambitions of the right to control. The amendments have been grouped separately, but I hope that the House will not mind if I speak very briefly to both. I was in the Chamber at 10.30 last night and, frankly, I have run out of puff.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09102776000117"></a>Both amendments have taken my original amendments, the ones that I worked very hard on with disabled people and RADAR on social care alignment and right to control definition, and incorporate both of them more than adequately and, actually, far more than I expected.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09102776000118"></a>This section of the Welfare Reform Bill has the potential to empower disabled people to become more active socially and economically by putting them in the driving seat of their support. There are hard times ahead for everyone who needs extra support to engage in their communities. More than ever, we need the right to control that support so that every penny is spent on what we know&#151;what disabled people know&#151;will make us independent and ready to take our part in society, whether that be work or other social responsibilities, such as bringing up families or volunteering. Both amendments take us towards that goal. They demonstrate a model of co-production between disabled people and government legislators and policy-makers. People think of co-production and think, &#147;Is this a new buzzword by Jane Campbell?&#148;. It is not because, for disabled people, co-production means simply that: we produce together. We are not just involved, we are not just consulted, we are there as equal partners in the outcome.</p>

<a name="91027-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09102776000119"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and his officials for showing not only how co-production can be done, but actually genuinely doing it.</p>

I think she said that she would hand them out at Report. As she said, and as the Minister said, the amendments herald a real shift in power from the state to disabled people and pave the way for the right to control to become the genuine one-stop empowerment shop that we all want it to be. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, the Minister, and RADAR, on working so hard to blaze a trail for the amendments. Let us hope that they are the shape of things to come.

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09102776000122"></a>This amendment pulls in one of the most important areas of plannable expenditure on disabled people, in the shape of community care services. It was always most peculiar to pilot a right to control that explicitly excluded this expenditure. An individual needs to have control of the full gamut of services in order to reshape them effectively; otherwise he or she will not be freed from dependency and bureaucracy. In fact, it makes far more sense to base the right-to-control approach on community care services, which are likely  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be required on a sustained and long-term basis, rather than on the more transitory requirements surrounding support for disabled people to secure employment, where the Bill was proposing a right to control. The late conversion smacks of the resolution of interdepartmental differences and, perhaps, difficulties in achieving joined-up government&#151;this time not between the DWP and the Treasury but between the DWP and the DCLG. Once again the Minister has come out on the right side.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09102776000123"></a>Less congratulatory, I re-emphasise a point that came up last week in Question Time when the Minister asserted that we on these Benches are planning to close down Access to Work as a result of our strategy to streamline welfare-to-work programmes in our work programme. I was able to assure him then that that is not the case. He should really leave the detailed exposition of our strategy to us rather than extrapolating it himself. The key distinction to make here is that the main components of our work programme incorporate mandatory elements, just as the Government&#146;s Pathways to Work and Flexible New Deal do. Clearly, welfare programmes that include mandatory elements are, at first blush at least, unpromising candidates for right to control. The programmes included in the right to control, such as Access to Work, are essentially voluntary, which makes them suitable for this approach. Clearly there is unfinished business here in terms of establishing the dividing line between voluntary and mandatory activity. I shall read with interest the Government&#146;s response to the consultation process on defining the eligibility for the right to control which we are promised later this year.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09102776000124"></a>To revert to the narrower matter of the inclusion of adult social care, it would be churlish to complain about the timing of the amendment. The Government have considered the matter and come up with the right proposal, which we wholeheartedly support. I must register our thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, who has worked so hard with officials over the summer to obtain this result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09102776000126"></a>On the exclusion of adult community care services, as we sought to explain in Committee, it was never the intention that they should be excluded. There were issues about how that should be reflected in the legislation, and that point in particular has driven this change. We have ended up where we always wanted to be. I accept what the noble Lord says about Access to Work&#151;we should leave the detailed exposition of his policies to him. Once the detail is in place, perhaps he will take the opportunity to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09102776000129"></a>In Committee debates on the Bill in this House, there was broad support for ensuring that the intended structure of the right to control was more clearly signalled in the Bill. The original wording of Clause 33 was deliberately broad to allow trailblazing authorities the flexibility to be innovative and to test the best ways  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of making the right to control work. It would have been sufficient to realise our commitments, but perhaps did not lay out those commitments as clearly as it might. Having listened carefully to the debates in Committee, we recognise that there is a balance to be struck between flexibility and clarity, which is why I bring this amendment before noble Lords today.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09102776000130"></a>The amendments are designed to retain flexibility in the delivery of the right to control while reflecting clearly the commitments made in the welfare reform White Paper. It clearly indicates in primary legislation that the disabled person will be at the centre of the right-to-control process. As noble Lords have said, we have worked closely with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton, in developing these amendments. Once again, my noble friend Lord McKenzie and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, for demonstrating their support for the amendments. This kind of consensus underlines the importance that we all place on this policy.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09102776000131"></a>Amendment 68 sets out the key components of the right to control process. In particular, it is a better reflection of our intentions in three key areas. First, the amended text makes it clear that authorities will be required to inform a disabled person of their right to control and the amount of money that is available for their support. This is entirely in keeping with our White Paper commitments, and will ensure that all disabled people in the trailblazing areas who are eligible for the right to control will be given the opportunity to access it.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09102776000132"></a>Secondly, the amendment reflects our White Paper commitment to partnership working. It makes it clear that authorities will be required to work with the disabled person throughout the support-planning and review processes. This will ensure that the disabled person is truly at the centre of the process and that their support plan reflects their individual needs and ambitions.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09102776000133"></a>Finally, the amendment reiterates the Government&#146;s belief that disabled people should have choice and control over their support, whether they take a direct payment, choose to receive authority-commissioned services, or a mixture of the two. The amended text makes it clear that, where a disabled person allows an authority to arrange all or some of their support, the authority will be required to follow the individual&#146;s support plan where reasonably practicable.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para10"></a>

This group makes it crystal clear that the disabled person, not the local authority, is in the driving seat when it comes to taking a decision on whether the right to control is appropriate.

This means that the arrangements will be brought into line with the way that the Government are proposing to proceed over the power to take away people&#146;s driving licences. It will ensure that a proper report is made on how the arrangements are working in practice which this House can consider and on which it can take a view.</p>

<a name="91027-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09102776000139"></a>The subject was intensively debated in Committee and I will rehearse the arguments in as succinct a form as possible. The power for officials to remove people&#146;s passports has been sought by the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission because the sanction has been found to be effective in other countries in persuading non-resident parents to pay up the child maintenance they owe. Great concern about this power has been expressed in the House. In Committee, my noble friend Lord Goodlad informed us that the Constitution Committee had concluded that suspending a person&#146;s right to hold a passport should be the responsibility of judges, not civil servants. I will not repeat all the powerful arguments he made reflecting the views of the Select Committee, except to remind the House that the conclusion was based on a recognition that the right to leave and return to one&#146;s country is recognised as a fundamental right in international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09102776000140"></a>This Bill represents the second occasion on which such a provision has been included. Just last year, the Government withdrew a similar proposal in the light of these concerns. We on these Benches accept that the proposal is designed to tackle some of the most recalcitrant of non-resident parents and to be used only as a last resort. Our amendment is drawn up in this way to check that such wide powers are properly used. CMEC took over the responsibilities of the Child Support Agency less than a year ago, so we are not looking to invest a tried and tested agency with these powers. The Child Support Agency was widely and officially criticised for inefficiency; the concern is that CMEC will make mistakes and target with these powers an unacceptable number of non-resident parents who do not owe maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09102776000141"></a>In Committee, the Minister tried to justify the different treatment of the powers over driving licences and passports. In his justification for a sunset clause on driving licences, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="09102776000377"></a>&#147;Clause 43 is intended to enable the DWP, the commission, the Department for Transport and the police to gauge whether there is any greater risk associated with an administrative as opposed to a court-based power to disqualify a person from driving, as well as evaluating its effectiveness in gaining compliance with child maintenance responsibilities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102776000327"></a>Exactly, one would reply. So why do not these arguments apply to passports? He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09102776000378"></a>&#147;I do not see a compelling case to justify piloting the travel authorisation passport power. That is because the concern raised by the committee&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="09102776000406"></a>&#147;primarily about the constitutional appropriateness of the measure, could not be addressed simply by a pilot in any event&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/7/09; cols. GC 148-49.]</ul>
<p><a name="09102776000329"></a>I imagine this distinction must puzzle the House as much as it puzzles me.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09102776000142"></a>Surely the point of a pilot is to find out whether powers work or are subject to abuse. What is the difference? Do we not want to evaluate the effectiveness of the power of passport removal in,</p>
<ul><a name="09102776000407"></a>&#147;gaining compliance with child maintenance responsibilities&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09102776000330"></a>I use the Minister&#146;s phrase exactly again&#151;just as much as we do for driving licences? Is it perhaps because, in the case of driving licences, various government agencies need to get their ducks in a row? Are the administrative concerns of various government agencies more important than the genuine and powerful concerns of this House? No. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has not yet earned the right to be taken on trust. Let this House have the opportunity to examine how these powers work in practice. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09102776000144"></a>I took a slightly different route to reach the same conclusion. There have been significant changes to the workload in CMEC. When we set it up 18 months ago, one of the biggest changes related to the fact that the whole of Section 6, as it was then known&#151;the people coming in through the income support route&#151;was a  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1123"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>vast administrative, bureaucratic weight that the old Child Support Agency had had to deal with. It never got off the bit; it was treading water the whole time trying to keep up with incoming cases that were not worth having. We had arguments about that.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09102776000145"></a>The significance of the change is that CMEC should be a much easier administrative organisation to run. Therefore, the complaint that there was not the capacity to deal with the administrative on-cost of the extra time and effort involved in going through the court process in its entirety is now much less applicable, because the organisation has a much smaller administrative workload.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09102776000146"></a>This would have been much safer if CMEC had worked for some time, not just a year or 18 months. The noble Lord, Lord Freud, is right: it is still in its relative infancy. It is a shame that CMEC&#146;s quarterly statistics are published only tomorrow; it will be interesting to see how it is getting on and I look forward to reading them in some detail. I have no great expectation that the trends of residual debt and all the other things will have changed much. This will take some time.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09102776000147"></a>If CMEC and the child commissioner had looked at this, run it for a few years and then come back to Parliament with some data showing a trend that we could follow that demonstrated that there were significant numbers of low-income families with children who were not getting support from parents who could pay but would not, that would have been substantially different. I yield to no one about the need to get that child maintenance to those hard-pressed families; anyone who took part in the passage of the Bill could see that the case was made that, in some cases, more urgent and active steps needed to be taken.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09102776000148"></a>The House took a serious look at this and sent it back, so for CMEC to come back the following year and ask Ministers to try to promote it again is pushing its luck, if I may use that colloquialism. I slightly resent that. A two-year sunset clause is entirely appropriate; in fact, I would have liked a slightly longer one, but I understand the importance of keeping the driving licence and passport provisions in tune with one another with regard to the two-year period. However, if we are to go through the whole process of pursuing these non-resident parents, I think that it will take more than two years to amass a body of data that will be useful to present to the House to see whether the sunset clause should be triggered. Subject to the fact that I would have liked the period to have been slightly longer because we would have had more data to work with, it is right that the amendment should be tabled and I shall certainly vote for it.

It is important that we make it clear to all potential fathers, particularly to young men, that they will suffer severe penalties if they do not pay their child maintenance&#151;that means, if they have a child. The default situation at the moment seems to be that, if you have a child and you have not really made any commitment to it, then you just forget about it. The previous Government brought forward the child maintenance Bill, but it has not worked. Then there was the other Bill&#151;I forget its name&#151;which

We now have a third attempt to make this thing work and I reckon that it is about our last chance. It is incredibly important that young people, particularly young fathers, are given the strong feeling that it is the opinion of our society that a father is equally responsible as the mother for a child who is brought into this world.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09102776000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, referred to somebody&#146;s right to leave and return to their own country unimpeded. That is right, but we should remember and recognise, as did the noble Lord, that the provisions kick in only when there has been wilful default and every other avenue for collecting money from the non-resident parent has been unsuccessfully explored and where the individual has the resources to deal with their commitments. The individual has it absolutely within their power to pay up and to regain their travel documentation or their driving licence. If they think that their assessment is wrong, they can appeal to the magistrates&#146; court, which stays the proceedings.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09102776000155"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, complained about bringing this back a year later. We said when we debated the provision in relation to the child maintenance Bill that we reserved the right to return to it. Effectively, we conceded the point only as a means of wrapping up the other issues that were still on the table. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, whom I see smiling, will remember our exchanges on that. We have never conceded this point.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09102776000156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that because Section 6 compulsion has gone, the organisation should be better able administratively to get to the courts. However, the other side of that coin should be an acceptance that CMEC will be more on top of getting the sums right and making sure that the collection procedures are as powerful as they can be. Therefore, there will be fewer residual cases to which the provisions might have to be applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09102776000157"></a>While all sides of the House can, I believe, agree on the need for the commission to take robust enforcement action where arrangements to pay child maintenance break down, I acknowledge&#151;it has been repeated today&#151;the differences of opinion among noble Lords about the specific measures detailed in Clause 42 and, in particular, their effectiveness in securing compliance with child maintenance obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09102776000158"></a>I hope that I can seek to allay any such concerns by accepting the amendments in principle and thereby giving Parliament the ability to review the travel authorisation provisions in the same way as already provided for in relation to the driving licence provisions by Clause 43. While the wording proposed in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is adequate for this purpose, I should be grateful if he did not press it at this stage so that I can return to the House with a more suitable form of amendment at Third Reading. The amendment that we would look to introduce would ensure that a report on the operation of the driving licence and travel authorisation powers must be put before Parliament within six months of the end of a two-year review period. Based on the success of the measures, the Secretary of State would have the option of making the administrative system permanent or reverting to the existing court-based powers. Any decision to maintain the administrative system would need to be made by an order subject to the affirmative procedure and noble Lords would thereby have an opportunity to debate the success of the measures prior to a permanent administrative system being introduced.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09102776000159"></a>The driving licence and travel authorisation provisions are two significantly different forms of enforcement with potentially very different impacts on the persons affected. It is therefore right that the piloting aspects be provided for in separate clauses. This will be the crucial difference between what we propose to bring back and what the noble Lord has tabled. It would enable, if required, a decision to be made in one way in respect of travel documentation and another way in respect of driving licences. There is some doubt as to whether that could be achieved by the existing wording, so it would be the essential difference in what we would bring back. I am satisfied that piloting the two provisions separately may enhance Parliament&#146;s ability properly to review the outcome and to decide whether the commission should retain such powers permanently.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09102776000160"></a>As has been referred to, the Government have until now resisted such an amendment. We consistently said that it was unnecessary, given that the primary aim of the driving licence pilot was to test the impact on road safety and implications for third parties, whereas the travel authorisation provisions contain no such risk. We stand by that view. However, we recognise the secondary objective of the pilot&#151;the noble Lord referred to it&#151;which is to measure how effective the administrative powers are in securing maintenance payments. On that basis, I am content that the travel authorisation powers should also be made subject to a pilot.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09102776000161"></a>I do so in part in recognition of the long way that noble Lords opposite have come on this issue. It has been an interesting journey, from outright condemnation of the administrative approach during the passage of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, to supporting the Commons earlier in the passage of this Bill and now to making the proposal before us today. However, it would be churlish to press that point. While perhaps not always a coherent approach, I welcome noble Lords&#146; movement towards the Government&#146;s position and so am content to make the change to the Bill that they propose. We are happy to move closer to their position on this point. On the

I am not going to spend a lot of time on this. We have rehearsed the arguments on why it is desirable to give the House a chance to have another look at this matter. The Minister summed it up, although it was perhaps not what he meant to say, when he said that CMEC should be able to do things with less pressure on it now because of the variance in administration. That is exactly the point that we want to look at. It should be able to, but does it? In practice, what the Government propose&#151;looking at a separate pilot in two years and six months, or as near to that timetable as you can get in getting Bills through&#151;would satisfy our requirements to have the oversight.

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09102776000164"></a>These are technical amendments, necessary to effect new Sections 2B, 2C and 2D in the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953. These sections cover the processes to be followed in cases where unmarried parents are acting separately, because they cannot or will not register jointly in the usual, co-operative way. I explained in Committee the background to these proposals so I shall try not to repeat myself unnecessarily today.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09102776000165"></a>In brief, the amendments seek to ensure that the processes to be followed by parents under our new proposals are as streamlined as possible. Under the joint birth registration provisions, most parents will register together, as they do now. However, in those exceptional cases when parents cannot or will not register the birth together, they may be required to provide information separately to the registrar. In some of these cases, the mother will give the registrar her required information in advance of the father providing his details. At this time, she will also give details of the father to the registrar, so that the registrar can contact him and require him to co-operate with the registration process. These amendments ensure that the mother will not be required to return again to the register office to sign the register once the father has been contacted. Instead, she will discharge her duty to sign the register by signing a declaration when she first attends. Therefore, when the birth is registered, once the father&#146;s information has been obtained, the entry will be considered to have been signed by the mother.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09102776000166"></a>We are currently in the process of developing detailed regulations&#151;in close co-operation with the General Register Office&#151;and it is essential that our regulation-making powers are sufficiently flexible to enable us to develop processes that are as straightforward as possible for those involved, particularly the parents themselves. We wish to avoid introducing, through these proposals, any unnecessary burdens for parents or registrars. For that reason, I beg to move.</p>

The principal difference in the two amendments is that the one I moved in Grand Committee would have precluded the father from being on the birth certificate if the mother said that she or her child was at serious risk of danger from the father. This amendment recognises that all children have a right to know their birth heritage, so the father's name would be registered, but he would not necessarily acquire thereby full parental responsibility if the mother believed that the father posed a risk to her child.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09102776000168"></a>In the Bill, if the unmarried mother alone registers the birth and does not provide crucial information about the father such as his current address, he cannot be contacted and cannot be registered because no data will be considered by the registrar that cannot be verified. However, the loophole that we seek to close is this: if the father contacts the registrar separately and before the mother registers the birth, giving his name and address and, later on, when the mother comes to register the child's birth perhaps inadvertently she confirms the father's name, the father has acquired full parental responsibility. The mother might say, &#147;Yes the father is John Brown but I don&#146;t know where he lives and I don't want to know because he is a violent man&#148;. The register might have no option but to say, &#147;But John Brown came in yesterday and gave me his address, saying he was the father of the child. You have just confirmed that, so he has now acquired full parental responsibility. If you had come in before him, I could have taken into account the fact that you do not know where he lives and do not want to know because he is a violent man. But now you have confirmed that he is the father, we have his address and he has now automatically acquired full parental responsibility&#148;.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09102776000169"></a>Under the amendment and in order to close that loophole, if the father sought to register the birth separately and before the mother, the father's name would still be on the child's birth certificate but he would not automatically acquire parental responsibility. He would need to apply for that responsibility through the courts under Section 4 of the Children Act 1989. That is the first safeguard for the mother and child.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09102776000170"></a>The second safeguard in the amendment is to ensure that the mother does not maliciously invent a story of domestic violence to stop the father from acquiring parental responsibility. We are saying that the mother would be required to make a legal declaration in a  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1129"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prescribed form to the registrar explaining that she had reasons to fear for her safety or that of her child. That declaration would be supported by an approved professional such as a midwife, health visitor, social worker, GP or other such person. Such approved professionals should have had training in child protection, domestic violence and abuse matters, and understand both the nature and effects of psychological and physical violence on mothers and children.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09102776000171"></a>Turning to the Government&#146;s arguments against this kind of safeguard, in Committee the Minister said that registrars do not wish to take on the quasi-judicial role of deciding who is and is not fit to exercise parental responsibility. We do not want that either. We are simply saying that, where serious concerns are raised by the mother, in the form of a legal declaration about violence or abuse, and are supported by an approved professional, it is safer for the child if the father applies to the court for parental responsibility. If the Bill is passed in its current form, the responsibility could pass to the mother to apply to the court to restrict the father&#146;s exercise of his parental responsibility&#151;not something that she would wish to be burdened with, having just given birth.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09102776000172"></a>The Minister also said that registrars do not ask married mothers whether they prefer not to have the father&#146;s name on a birth certificate, or whether they would prefer to limit the father&#146;s parental responsibility. I found this an extraordinary statement, and one that does not recognise the serious concerns of those in the field, such as the NSPCC and Gingerbread. They are worried about this loophole in Bill, which I have spoken about. The word &#147;prefer&#148; does not come into it if the father is violent or abusive.</p>

<a name="91027-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09102776000173"></a>Finally, the Minister said that if there is a genuine problem, the Government should take a proper look at the evidence that exists to address any problems in a coherent way. The NSPCC has many case studies to illustrate why it thinks that there is a problem, but this is not the place or time to read any of them out. The NSPCC says that the rights conferred as a result of parental responsibility can be manipulated and present a threat to children. Parents with parental responsibility have the right to a say in all important matters in relation to the child, including the child&#146;s name, education, medical treatment and decisions about where the child lives. The case examples given to me clearly show that there are circumstances in which the courts consider that the potential to misuse parental responsibility is so great that it would not be in the child&#146;s best interests for it to be awarded.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91027-0006.htm"/>


<a name="91027-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09102776000174"></a>In general, courts are minded to award parental responsibility to unmarried fathers, since they can use other measures to address child protection. For example, the court may award an unmarried father a parental responsibility order, but refuse an application for contact and introduce a prohibited steps order to prevent him taking certain actions. The NSPCC is concerned that, under the Bill, fathers in the case examples that it has given would automatically acquire parental responsibility, even where registrars are informed about the mother&#146;s child protection concerns, and without the opportunity for rigorous scrutiny and the introduction of other measures to protect the child that courts can introduce.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09102776000175"></a>To sum up, the proposed exemption will affect only a very small number of unmarried fathers, where they have contacted registrars independently of the mother, and she has made a legal declaration&#151;supported by an approved professional&#151;that he poses a risk to her and her child. In these circumstances, unmarried fathers can still acquire parental responsibility by making an application to the court under Section 4(1)(a) of the Children Act 1989, as they are currently able to do. This is safer for children than automatically awarding parental responsibility when child protection concerns are raised. Registrars should inform fathers that the option to apply for parental responsibility is available to them. We would also encourage some flexibility so that, if the courts consider that it is inappropriate to award parental responsibility, fathers are able to reapply for parental responsibility at a later stage. I beg to move.</p>

I remind the Minister that I took part at an earlier stage of the Bill. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, for taking up this issue on my behalf, as I was involved in the transatlantic airline bombing trial and was not able to be here. However, previously I spoke of my concerns about domestic violence and how elements of it could be addressed in the Bill. I thank the Minister for his sensitivity to the issue and for having addressed some of my concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09102776000177"></a>In light of the concerns expressed by noble Lords in Grand Committee, we looked again at how we could address their fears. Concern was expressed that vindictive mothers could block willing fathers from taking paternal responsibility. We wanted to find a formula that could address that, because such women exist and it would be silly to deny that. It is right and proper that the Government should seek to embody in law the responsibility that parents, especially fathers, must take for their children. Indeed, there is growing concern that insufficient attention has been paid to paternal responsibility in the past; we agree with that. However, our concern, and that of some major charities and organisations that deal with domestic violence, is the small number of cases in which violence is clearly involved. Research shows that domestic violence often rears its head when women are pregnant and that it often accelerates in the months before the arrival of a newborn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09102776000178"></a>We are concerned that a new mother who has just delivered a baby is expected to go through the courts to seek to remove the paternal responsibility, which is automatically inserted if the father has registered the birth. We are asking that the opposite should apply&#151;namely, that a father against whom there is evidence of abuse has to be proactive in securing paternal rights. He should have to go to the court to obtain a remedy and to have his paternal responsibility invoked. The amendment would secure that. The father would automatically be given parental responsibility, but not if the mother made an independent declaration supported by an appropriate professional. Therefore, safeguards would be in place and the provision would be invoked only where the woman who had given birth really

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09102776000179"></a>I endorse what the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said. No one imagines that this measure would be used in many cases, but in serious cases where there is a particularly controlling and abusive father one has to ensure that these steps are taken to prevent his using his declaration as yet another metaphorical stick with which to beat his partner. I ask the Government to look again at this measure. I say immediately that I am very conscious of how alert the Government are to domestic violence issues, but those of us who deal with these cases in the courts know that abusive partners and fathers often try to secure rights that perhaps should be limited. The amendment would put the burden on the father, rather than on the mother, to go through this process.</p>

First, I apologise to the House that I have not been here so far during the passage of the Bill. This is a discrete issue about which I feel quite strongly. In principle, I support the registration of the birth of a child in the names of both parents, but there are a few exceptions. Those were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, who set out the case for the amendment extremely coherently and eloquently.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09102776000181"></a>A small minority of fathers misuse parental responsibility to the risk of the mother and child. I understand that in Committee the Government said that there was no risk to mothers and children from parental responsibility. I have to say that I disagree, from my own experience as a judge trying these very cases. I have tried a series of cases where, under the present law, fathers had to go to court and had to ask for parental responsibility. In a number of cases, I have had to say no. I remember one case vividly. It involved a girl from Liverpool whose father was a sexual abuser who abused her as a child. Her uncle was a sexual abuser who abused her and the child she bore. She went to live with a man who turned out to be a sexual abuser and she had to move again. She found yet another man to be the father to her child and he, too&#151;can you believe it?&#151;was a sexual abuser. The case came before me because he was violent to her and he was abusing the small child, and social services said that they had to take the child away from the mother. These cases happen.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09102776000182"></a>I know of another case where the girl was living with a man who made her pregnant. He was extremely violent towards her. She ran away to a refuge, where she was anxious, for obvious reasons, that he should not know where she was and he should not come near her or the child, who was born while she was in the refuge.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09102776000183"></a>Under the government proposals, if that man went separately to the registrar and asked to have his name added, he would automatically acquire parental responsibility. He would search the mother out and he might well be violent toward her. But it is perhaps more worrying that parental responsibility gives the man rights as well as responsibilities. He would have a right to tell her where he wanted the child to go to school. The importance of that is that, if he knew

He could also be violent towards the child. Fathers, even fathers who love their children, are from time to time sufficiently violent that some children die. We have a record in this country of the death of something like two children a week by their father or stepfather. That is a very small minority, but the automatic granting of parental responsibility carries with it a risk from violent fathers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09102776000184"></a>It is the child who is more important than the mother, but if the mother thinks that she will be injured&#151;she may be&#151;or thinks that the child may be injured, the care that she is giving to the child is less good than it should be, because she is always fearful of what might happen to both of them, and so the welfare of the child suffers from that fear.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09102776000185"></a>If the Government believe that the automatic granting of parental responsibility does not carry a risk for a small minority, I can tell them from my own experience as a judge that it really does. Whether this is the right formulation of the way to protect the mother and child, I do not know. I came late to this. I was alerted to the amendment and felt that I should express my view. I strongly advise the Government to look at this lacuna in their proposed new law to address the risk that another mother and child will be injured, or a child will be killed. This is a very serious matter and I support the amendment.</p>

I am concerned about violence among some minorities, particularly in cases of forced and polygamous marriages, where the women have very few rights. Women who run away with a child are considered to be dishonouring the entire clan and family. It is not unheard of for gangs of uncles and brothers to murder women who have been abused and beaten and to take the child away. Although these women and children are in a minority, they have rights and must be protected.</p>

The amendment would prevent the automatic acquisition of parental responsibility by the man who makes a declaration to the registrar that he is the father, if the mother, supported by an approved professional, declares that she has reason to fear for her safety.

An interesting conflict is developing here with evidence given in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley. She said that the Government knew of no compelling evidence that registering the birth and acquiring responsibility make a man violent or exacerbate violent behaviour. That would seem not to be the same experience as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, outlined in her hard-hitting testimony.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09102776000190"></a>The Minister went on in Committee to say that the violence of these men must be dealt with independently of the birth registration system. I concur with that. Any violence or threat of violence must be dealt with quickly, fairly and comprehensively. However, I do not think that we will achieve that goal by adding into the mix an extra complication to the birth registration process. The issue of parental responsibility is fundamentally important. Responsibility should be removed only by the courts and not, as the amendment of the noble Baroness would allow, by a decision taken by the registrar of births, even if it is on the advice of a professional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09102776000204"></a>So far we have not seen convincing arguments for adopting a different approach to this small percentage of fathers, particularly in light of the figures from the British Crime Survey which I quoted in Committee and which indicated that the women most likely to be affected by domestic violence are those who are divorced or separated from their husbands, not those who are single or co-habiting.</p>

While this is not necessarily a question of parental responsibility, perhaps it does highlight the need for some schools and other organisations to improve their practice. It is helpful for such examples to be brought to our attention. However, it does not follow that the question of whether or not unmarried fathers should be given parental responsibility should be determined through the birth registration process at the earliest stage of a child&#146;s life. Decisions about removing or restricting parental responsibility are extremely serious and should be made only on the basis of clear evidence and by means of a process that is able to take account of evidence across the board.</p>

That is why, under our new provisions, no steps will be taken by a registrar to contact the child&#146;s father in cases where the mother has stated that she fears harm as a result. However, at the same time, the provisions recognise the importance of a child&#146;s right to know his or her identity, to be acknowledged by both parents and to know that both parents take responsibility for him or her. That is why they do not prevent a father coming forward of his own accord in order to have his name recorded as the child&#146;s father.</p>

In the case of births where parents are not married to each other, 85 per cent are already registered jointly. The policy will therefore affect only a very small percentage of unmarried parents. But these provisions are not about the parents. Although they do strike a fairer balance between the rights of each parent, they are about the child. Debates in Committee touched on the importance of a father being involved in his child&#146;s life and the difference this makes in terms of outcomes. This is our focus.</p>

<a name="91027-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09102776000213"></a>I mentioned a loophole which the Minister has not addressed at all. It is the circumstance in which the father contacts the registrar before the mother&#151;the mother perhaps inadvertently having said that he is the father. The father, perhaps an abusive and violent man, then acquires full parental responsibility for the first time. I included in the amendment the safeguard that the mother must have a professional supporting her so that she does not make a malicious declaration. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09102776000214"></a>I thought that the amendment produced by the NSPCC was extremely neat. This is a new situation. We cannot say that that has nothing to do with the birth registration, because the Government have made it part of it by putting it in the Bill. I am extremely tempted to test the opinion of the House, but I know this House. As the Minister has suggested a meeting, immediately everyone wants to go to the meeting to put the case, so I know that the momentum will have gone out of the vote. But I ask the Minister whether such a meeting might lead to a government amendment at Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09102776000215"></a>If it does not, I am still tempted to test the opinion of the House, but if the meeting is genuine with the possibility of an amendment, I will withdraw the amendment. I ask the noble Baroness to intervene to tell me whether there is the possibility of finding an amendment at Third Reading to reflect the debate that has taken place today. The comments made, especially by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, who knows about the matter, should not be ignored.</p>

<a name="09102776000229"></a><b><a name="91027-0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09102776000591"></a>Lord Harries of Pentregarth:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful for the opportunity to introduce this short debate. I do so as patron of the Ecumenical Council for Corporate Responsibility. Its recent report on migrant workers focuses particularly on the responsibility of companies, but its concerns go wider than this to include government regulation in this field, which is our concern this evening.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09102776000230"></a>As we all know, when workers are vulnerable, it means that their work is insecure and low paid and they are at high risk of employment rights abuses. A typical example is a London cleaner who said, &#147;I work for an agency. I&#146;m &#145;self-employed&#146;. They pay me &#163;2.29 per room. I can&#146;t clean enough rooms to make the minimum wage. There is no sick pay or holiday pay, and I have to pay for my own cleaning materials and uniform out of my wages&#148;. Some 2 million people in this country are in vulnerable employment, and migrant workers form a very significant percentage of them. Most obtain work through one of the 17,000 employment agencies that form the largest and most fragmented agency sector in Europe and are worth some &#163;25 billion. These agencies employ more than 1.25 million workers,  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1140"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about 4.5 per cent of the workforce. They are particularly relevant to migrant workers. More than 700,000 EU immigrants have entered the UK since May 2004, and a very good number of them are employed through these agencies.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09102776000231"></a>Since the Morecambe Bay disaster in February 2003, when 23 Chinese cockle pickers were drowned, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has been set up to prevent similar tragedies. Its remit covers the agricultural, forestry, horticultural, shellfish gathering, food processing and food packaging industries. There seems to be general agreement that in these sectors the GLA has had a significant impact. It licences about 1,230 gangmasters and has some 180,000 workers on its database. Abuses that were once quite common have been greatly reduced. There are still some further actions the GLA can take to ensure that its work is even more effective, but I shall not consider them in detail this evening.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09102776000232"></a>However, the trade union Unite is concerned about two issues in particular. First, although the Government have signed up to the European directive, current drafts for implementation of that directive are still lacking in many areas. This means that unscrupulous employers can exploit loopholes. Secondly, it believes there need to be much stronger linkages between the various employment rights enforcement agencies, greater resources and priority put on enforcement. In addition, there is still the major problem of unlicensed agencies in its sector; perhaps 25 to 40 per cent of gangmasters within its remit are at present unlicensed.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09102776000233"></a>However, the setting up of the GLA has shown that in areas where abuses were once very prevalent, they have now been significantly reduced and curtailed. The implication of this is clear. Where there are abuses of vulnerable migrant workers in other areas, an effective means of stopping them exists. There are abuses in other areas of employment, particularly in the construction, hospitality and care sectors. Unscrupulous gangmasters, thwarted in their original areas of employment, have shifted their focus.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09102776000234"></a>There is also the phenomenon of what have been labelled phoenix companies, whose licences have been withheld but which quickly emerge under another name to employ workers who are vulnerable. Many of those workers will be made to work for long hours on less than the minimum wage in unsatisfactory conditions, perhaps with exorbitant deductions for accommodation or transport.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09102776000235"></a>There are many such examples. I shall briefly cite two, one of which is from the construction industry. &#147;I was working 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, as an apprentice plumber. I was being paid about &#163;1.84 an hour. My employer said this was normal and I should be grateful. Then he attacked me because I asked for a copy of my terms and conditions&#148;. One agency charged a worker &#163;250 for his clothes: a pair of trousers, two T-shirts and a sweatshirt. He called it his Versace gear.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09102776000236"></a>When this issue has been raised before, both in this House and in the other place, the Government have said that the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate has the responsibility for dealing with such abuses and is capable of doing so. I do not like to be critical, and I  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>know that the EAS inspectorate is currently running a &#163;1.25 million campaign to raise awareness of employment rights among vulnerable agency workers, but, to date, Oxfam and other researchers have found migrant workers to have little or no knowledge of either the EAS inspectorate or their employment rights. Indeed, not a single migrant worker was aware of the EAS inspectorate before the visit of a researcher. The EAS inspectorate is still poorly resourced, with only one inspector for every 700 agencies. There is little support among businesses for its work because of the lack of enforcement, and it has succeeded in recovering very little money for illegally withheld workers&#146; wages.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09102776000237"></a>This is a technical field in which I have no competence, but I can report that those who do&#151;relevant trade unions, Oxfam and others who have done the research&#151;believe that the only effective remedy for the abuses in the construction, hospitality and care industries is to extend the remit of the GLA to cover them. The GLA has shown that it works effectively, it has the confidence of businesses and, as a bonus, it actually recovers significant amounts of VAT for the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09102776000238"></a>As I say, there is significant exploitation in the construction industry. Estimates of the numbers of construction workers with unclear employment status vary from 200,000 to 1 million. I shall cite an example of the kind of abuse that has been uncovered. &#147;I&#146;ve done jobs in all parts of the country: Leicester, Leeds, Manchester. You&#146;re taken in the back of a van, and sometimes I don't even know where I've been when I get back. The vans are overcrowded, unsafe, uncomfortable. The gangmaster phones you and says &#145;Come to a certain place, a certain road junction at 5 am&#146;. So you go and wait. Sometimes you work for a week, including Saturday and Sunday, and might get just &#163;50. You don't get a wage slip; it&#146;s cash in hand. The transport to and from the jobs often eats up most of the money. Often you sleep on the site. The gangmasters have a way of hooking you in. You work for a week and they pay you, but next week they won't pay you. They ask you to come back next week and they pay you for this, but they still owe you one or two weeks&#146; wages so you can't really leave them&#148;. There is also, of course, a great lack of health and safety among such vulnerable workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09102776000239"></a>This kind of abuse is no less prevalent in the hospitality sector. Many hotels no longer employ people directly but prefer to go through an agency. One union organiser noted that the hotels must be aware of the exploitation because, &#147;It&#146;s happening so frequently right under their noses in almost every hotel&#148;. One cleaner reports, &#147;I&#146;m cleaning rooms in a small hotel with 20 rooms. I got the job through an agency when I was still in Spain. The hotel pays me &#163;25 for eight hours&#146; work. They pay me cash in hand, with no wage slip. I know they should pay me the minimum wage, but what can I do? The agency won't defend me or help me with this&#148;. She is charged exorbitant prices for accommodation in a very crowded, unsafe house, and says, &#147;It&#146;s a big agency on the internet supplying people to work in hotels all over London&#148;.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09102776000240"></a>More research is needed in the care sector, but even there the research that has been done shows significant levels of abuse. We have to remember that we are an

In 2007, 28 per cent of those recruited to work in this sector were migrant workers, and it is clear that already there is some evidence of abuse.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09102776000241"></a>In 2008, the Home Affairs Select Committee noted that outside the GLA sectors, enforcement is at best patchy and at worst non-existent. The GLA, whatever improvements are still needed, has shown that it can make a big impact. Just a couple of days ago I talked to someone whose company employs hundreds of migrant workers. He told me that the existence of the GLA had in fact totally transformed his relationship with migrant workers and he had confidence in the authority. There is a clear case for extending its remit to include the construction, hospitality and care sectors. I very much look forward to hearing what the Government have to say and to learning something from the other speakers in tonight&#146;s debate.</p>

Since those days in the 1980s when there was a lot of privatisation and liberalisation, much work has been done by successive Governments to protect employees, but sadly not in relation to the growing number of vulnerable workers. They have fewer rights, and even those they have are not fully enforced.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09102776000243"></a>Vulnerable migrant workers are subject to exploitation at various levels. Illegal deductions are made from their wages, they are given false assurances about the nature of their jobs before they come to this country, many do not enjoy sick or holiday pay, and sometimes they are falsely classified as self-employed so that the normal regulations do not apply. In some cases, particularly in the hospitality industry, piece-rates are paid with the result that almost 18 per cent of migrant workers in this sector are paid below the minimum wage. All these are disturbing facts, but unfortunately migrant workers are not in a position to complain or to secure redress. That is because they do not know their rights, their language skills are limited, there is anxiety among both legal and illegal migrant workers over their immigration status, and they do not have the financial resources to prosecute those involved in exploitative practices. A great deal therefore needs to be done.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09102776000244"></a>Happily, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has been doing interesting work in this area, but it has its limits. In the next few minutes, I want to suggest six or seven different ways in which the work of the GLA could be improved. First, it is striking that between 25 and 40 per cent of gangmasters are not licensed, so something needs to be done to make sure that they are properly examined and licensed, and that unlicensed gangmasters are not allowed to operate. Secondly, the GLA shares information with the UK Border Agency. As a result, the information it obtains has to do with how migrant workers have come to this country. Naturally, these workers are fearful of how the information will be used and are not in a position to trust the GLA. It is therefore important that the authority&#146;s task should have nothing to do with the immigration status of these workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09102776000245"></a>Thirdly, the GLA needs greater resources than it has at present to conduct better in-depth assessments of gangmasters, collect intelligence on the worst forms of exploitation, and make more frequent unannounced visits. Fourthly, it should have the power to impose heavier penalties than it does at the moment. I gather that the GLA has already made several proposals in this direction and I hope very much that the Government will look upon them favourably. Fifthly, as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, rightly pointed out, the remit of the GLA needs to extend into areas which at present are not covered. I have in mind the care, construction and hospitality sectors, especially construction and hospitality where many of these exploitative practices tend to occur. Sixthly, the trade unions should be more actively involved in inspecting workplaces, particularly those where vulnerable migrant workers are not in a position to complain and GLA inspections are not as probing as they could be. It is therefore important that trade unions should inspect workplaces and report cases of abuse.</p>

<a name="91027-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09102776000246"></a>Finally, we need to depend not only on the GLA&#151;useful and important as it is&#151;but to ensure that it is able to establish strong links with trade unions, voluntary organisations and migrant community organisations. All these organisations need to work together and co-ordinate their strategies in order to raise awareness of the rights that the migrant workers have and the abuses to which they are subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09102776000248"></a>During the passage of immigration legislation I have been primarily concerned with the rights of asylum seekers and, generally, I congratulate the Government on their migration policy. I was disappointed during the BBC&#146;s &#147;Question Time&#148; that the three main political parties did not stand up to the BNP representative and proclaim the success of migration. We need to claim not only that numbers are coming down or that historically this country has a good reputation, but that by accepting skilled migrants today we are enriching our society and supporting our economy. We need to hear this message more often from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09102776000249"></a>If there is any increase in support for the BNP&#151;which I doubt because the programme will have put a lot of people off&#151;then it does not help the Government to compete with the policies of the BNP and water down their stand against racism and in favour of migration. As a former member of the Independent Asylum Commission, I am fully persuaded of the case for certain categories of migrants from outside the EU to be allowed into the country with temporary work permits. I am thinking especially of skilled Zimbabweans, some of whom have sought asylum here. But they are not really asylum seekers; they are waiting patiently for a genuine political reform and economic stability in their country. Has the Minister detected any change in heart towards these people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09102776000251"></a>Tomorrow we continue the Report stage of the Coroners and Justice Bill and my noble friend Lady Young has again tabled her amendment proposing a new offence of forced labour or servitude. The use of the term &#147;servitude&#148; is not exaggerated; there are hundreds of victims of forced labour in this country, including domestic workers, some of whom are literally imprisoned in private houses. My noble friend has mentioned unscrupulous employers so I shall concentrate on the domestic group.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09102776000252"></a>Much of what I say is guided by a recent meeting that my noble friend Lady Young and I attended with Patience, a migrant domestic worker originally recruited in Nigeria for a domestic position in London. She worked long hours, was given no day off and was never given the &#163;50 a week originally promised. Her employer told her, &#147;Your money is safe with me&#148;. When she made a mistake she was pinched and slapped, and she was not allowed to leave the house even to buy a phone card to make a call home. She told us that her employer &#147;beat me until I cried, so loud that a neighbour even knocked on the door&#148;. However, hers is a success story because eventually she was able to make contact with Kalayaan, a respected NGO which helps domestic workers, and her employer was taken to the tribunal and eventually charged with assault and theft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09102776000253"></a>The Minister, more than any of us because of his long experience in this field, will be able to quote the International Labour Organisation conventions ILO 25 on forced labour and ILO 105 on the abolition of forced labour. ILO 25 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="09102776000402"></a>&#147;The illegal exaction of forced or compulsory labour shall be punishable as a penal offence, and it shall be an obligation on any Member ratifying this Convention to ensure that the penalties imposed by law are really adequate and are strictly enforced&#148;.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09102776000254"></a>The Minister will know that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, wrote a letter to my noble friend on 13 October in which he tacitly recognised that the law needed to be changed but said that there was no compelling reason to change it. I accept that a new offence may be difficult to prove, but I also know that the current offences are proving to be inadequate. The Government have made great advances, such as the 2003 Act on trafficking and the gangmasters Act, which has also been mentioned, but I was surprised to read in the letter that there was no evidence that people are currently escaping justice, when case after case is being quoted by lawyers and non-governmental organisations. I was concerned to read that the Government apparently need to make a new assessment of the scale of the problem. We are always hearing Ministers retreat behind reviews and consultations when there are already specialised organisations with the evidence required.</p>

It must be sensible to ensure that the authority covers construction workers and other sectors but also to release it from its duty in immigration control, which is holding up a lot of its other work. The Migrants&#146; Rights Network has been lucid on this subject. Personally, I am not certain that the GLA would be able to handle domestic workers directly, but I know its work would be encouraged by my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09102776000256"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bach, is not convinced that the European convention requires the Government to enact a separate and specific offence, but Article 4 imposes on public authorities in the UK an obligation to protect people from slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour. I hope therefore that the Minister can say that the Government will think again before tomorrow evening when we return to this issue.</p>

Like the noble Earl, I am grateful for the work of the Migrants&#146; Rights Network in arguing for the need for the clear protection of workers&#146; rights at a time when there is increasing pressure to ensure that the immigration status of migrants is checked and checked again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09102776000258"></a>One of the results of making UK employers responsible for the immigration status of their employees has too often been that such workers have not been able to campaign freely for better conditions, or even for decent wages. The worker registration scheme is long-winded and taxing, and people come to fear that somewhere there may be an error in their documentation that could lead to their being thrown out of work altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09102776000259"></a>In seeking to involve migrant workers in the life of the local community, one of the most effective areas of integration is that of Integration Lincolnshire, set up in order to affirm the rights of migrant workers in that county and to ensure that they are seen as a group that has come and contributed greatly to the life of that community. I hope that the way in which people who come to this country contribute to its life and common aims and values will again be stressed.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09102776000260"></a>However, rural workers in Lincolnshire lose their jobs simply because of the complexity and inefficiency of the system. Integration Lincolnshire has been concerned with people found camping by the River Witham in Boston, unable either to find work or to return home. Documents become lost in the system, and that complexity damages us all.</p>

However, even there, as so often in these areas, there can be unintended consequences. One of them is that gangmasters much less frequently have a policy of providing housing for those who come as vulnerable workers because that housing will be audited. I suggest not that the gangmasters licensing requirements be altered so that housing is not audited, but that there needs to be  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>careful examination to ensure that family members not directly involved as gangmasters do not set up to provide housing of a much lower standard than the audit requires.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09102776000262"></a>I stress the pressure that is on those who have protection needs. The time limitations make it increasingly difficult for such people to find stable, well paid work, so they quite unnecessarily become vulnerable in their work. One of the unintended consequences of the earned citizenship proposals is that the period of uncertainty is extended yet again, meaning that migrants with protection needs will find themselves in low-paid and temporary employment. They are not able to guarantee long-term commitment to employers or to higher education courses. The result is that community cohesion becomes less easy to achieve, because migrant workers with protection needs appear not to be willing to work. They are then viewed as lazy and as uncomfortable neighbours at exactly the point when they should be able to contribute to our wider society.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09102776000263"></a>We are placing ever greater burdens on those who are keen to contribute to and want to repay our society through paid employment. I think of those in Leeds whom I meet who are trained in their own countries and who cannot access employment here&#151;doctors, teachers, social workers&#151;for whom the downward spiral begins again. Their very frustration leads to mental health problems and they find themselves either dependent on benefits or in secret, low-paid, vulnerable jobs with no security and without the protection which we rightly regard as vital to workers&#146; well-being.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09102776000264"></a>I continue to believe that permission to work for asylum seekers awaiting a decision would be the most valuable key to community cohesion that the Government could introduce. I am haunted by thoughts of those whom I know who cannot legally work and whose support has recently been cut. Such permission would protect them from unscrupulous employers and dangerous working conditions. At present, people often find work of a sort and become extremely vulnerable in it. It would benefit the economy and communities to allow them to seek proper work, and it would significantly relieve the dangers to which so many noble Lords are pointing in this welcome debate.</p>

I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that one way in which to protect migrant workers&#146; rights is to encourage a culture of acceptance. We should be clear about the benefits that migrant workers create&#151;the benefits to their country by virtue of the money that they send back, the immigrants who return home with newly acquired skills and the training and larger horizons that they acquire here, and the benefits to the host country by virtue of the economic contribution that they make and the social and cultural benefits of diversity. I agree that we are too small a country to afford an open-door policy but, equally, if immigrants stopped coming, we would become a much poorer nation and a less interesting place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09102776000266"></a>What are the facts? From 1995 to 2005, the standard of living in this country rose considerably, as did immigration. Some 55,000 foreign workers were granted the right to settle here in 1995. Ten years later, the number had risen to 179,000. Since 2004, an equally large number have come from the European Union member states.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09102776000267"></a>Migration is often a search for greater opportunity. Nowadays many migrants are women, often leaving traditional societies to seek greater opportunities for themselves, as well as work. It is a mark of our success that they choose to come here. They get the protection mentioned by the noble and right reverend Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09102776000268"></a>My noble friend Lord Parekh mentioned illegal migrant workers. Of course, the situation is made more complicated by illegal immigration. Unscrupulous people exploit them and can do harm to migrants who are here illegally. But it is the exploiters&#151;often their employers and the people traffickers&#151;who do much of the harm. It is they who must be brought before the courts, as the Government are absolutely right to emphasise.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09102776000269"></a>At the same time, I should like the Government to emphasise more the advantages of migration, particularly the freedom of movement within the European Union. Membership of the European Union gives us three basic freedoms: the movement of goods, of capital and of people. It is the freedom of people and migration within the European Union that European citizens value most. Ask your friends, especially those who are retired; ask your children and your grandchildren. What they value most is the right to study, live, work, marry and travel freely in the European Union. That freedom is valued throughout the European Union and it is a very important part of the migration equation. We should be hearing a lot more about it.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09102776000270"></a>It is unimaginable that we would go back to the past. The genuine diversity, particularly in our cities, and the economic vitality brought about by immigration have become part of our way of life. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, is concerned about immigrant workers&#146; rights and gangmasters, as am I&#151;not only from the point of view of the workers&#146; human and employee rights but because we need to continue to benefit from the economic, social and cultural contributions made by the immigrants who come here and from our fellow citizens who choose to migrate elsewhere.</p>

Like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, I believe that allowing asylum seekers to work legally would do much for community cohesion and, indeed, for their own happiness. However, at the moment there is a sense out there among the public that people are being smuggled into this country to work either as forced labourers, in forced prostitution, for example, or simply to earn far more money than they would earn at home. You have a picture of crime, exploitation, fear and public suspicion.</p>

The public felt sorry for the people but not at all sure about the practices of gangmasters. One can understand that. To set the story in its context&#151;and this is what most of the public think when they hear about migrant workers, if they do not simply feel a deep unease&#151;the gangmaster concerned was himself Chinese, he recruited Chinese cocklers, he provided the equipment and he apparently shared the profits. He was accused and found guilty of gross negligence, which led to the cocklers drowning, but he, along with his girlfriend, also helped people to breach immigration law. He had first got into cockling about a year earlier in Barrow-in-Furness and he was recruited into organising a cockling group by someone who offered to buy the cockles from him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09102776000275"></a>Here is the story. In order to extend his visa to stay in the country, he had registered at a London college, which offered English language courses, but he said that he never actually attended lessons. In his court appearance, he said that he had been instructed by the man running the college, Mr Chan, to familiarise himself with the buildings in case he was investigated by the immigration authorities. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="09102776000403"></a>&#147;I was told if the Home Office investigates that college, at least I know where is the college&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102776000331"></a>Before that, he had made a poor living&#151;he was himself exploited&#151;in Merseyside washing up in Chinese restaurants. So here we have it&#151;gangmasters, false college courses, tricking the immigration authorities and, of course, the deaths of the Chinese workers who were drowned when the tide came in. Those Chinese received considerable public sympathy, but their gangmaster and others like him did not.</p>

ECCR&#146;s research into nine large British food companies, ranging from Northern Foods to Morrisons, suggested that, while all take some responsibility for what goes on lower down the food chain, by no means all do anything to ensure migrant workers&#146; welfare. Nor do any of them incentivise the suppliers of food who use migrant workers to improve the conditions of those people. In the survey, Northern Foods, Sainsbury&#146;s and Tesco came out way ahead, but even they&#151;and there was some impressive practice&#151;did not do huge amounts to help.

That is why this issue is one that the Government have to take on sympathetically rather than simply arguing for firm action. Many of these people have been in this country and treated appallingly for many years.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09102776000277"></a>These days, employers are increasingly involved in immigration enforcement issues. They are expected to check papers and, since the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, brought in by this Government, they find themselves subject to recorded increases in raids on workplaces and employer fines, especially since the new civil penalty regime for immigration check failures came into force last year. Because of all that, many employers are erring on the side of caution, as the Migrants&#146; Rights Network has reported, because they are so worried about getting it wrong and because the guidance&#151;some 80 pages long&#151;is rather complicated. Interviews for the Migrants&#146; Rights Network&#146;s <I>Papers Please</I> report show that this may well mean that employers dismiss, or decline to engage, migrant workers who cannot provide clear and unambiguous evidence of a regular immigration status. This particularly affects refugees, migrants varying their leave and A2 migrants&#151;Romanians and Bulgarians&#151;whose need for documentation emerged as unclear while the interviews were being conducted.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09102776000278"></a>The worst evidence comes from the cleaning and hospitality sectors, where vulnerable undocumented migrants often work in unsuitable and dangerous conditions, as many noble Lords have said. The report documented incidents that include employers forcing workers who could not produce adequate documentation to resign. They called in the UK Border Agency to ambush workers in the workplace and dismissed workers, withholding back pay.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09102776000279"></a>All the emphasis on immigration enforcement in the workplace is clearly having a negative effect on vulnerable migrant workers&#146; capacity to campaign for better treatment and conditions. <I>Papers Please</I> suggested that immigration checks had been used by employers to disrupt collective action under the ongoing living-wage campaigns carried out by contract cleaners in various workplaces in London. It was alleged that this had been a factor in the raid on SOAS in June, when eight migrant workers were arrested and seven removed from the country as a result of the raid.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09102776000280"></a>The Gangmasters Licensing Authority also requires employers to carry out a check, which may inhibit the GLA&#146;s own ability to protect the rights and interests of those vulnerable and undocumented workers. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds has made it clear that we ought to think differently about this.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09102776000281"></a>What needs to happen now? First, the Home Office needs to inform and educate employers about how to remain within the law on immigration without resorting to discriminatory practices, which is what we are seeing. The present information materials are far too geared towards fostering fear and mistrust of migrant workers and not enough towards the race equality implications of the regulations.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09102776000282"></a>Secondly, the present reliance on holding an appropriate immigration status to access any employment rights enables vulnerable migrant workers to be exploited at will. This is not so very different from how, in my own Jewish community, some factory owners used to exploit the newcomers just off the boats in the sweatshops, as they were called, in the East End of London in the 1880s and 1890s. It must be possible for various employment standards agencies, such as the Fair Employment Enforcement Board, the national minimum wage inspectorate and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to ensure that employment rights are protected, irrespective of immigration status. Can the Government assure the House that they will look at ways of ensuring that that happens? In particular, will they consider removing the GLA&#146;s present concern with the immigration status of workers in favour of a real and deep concern with the welfare of vulnerable people, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, has said?</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09102776000283"></a>Thirdly, can the Government ensure that the GLA&#146;s remit is extended, as many, including Oxfam, Unite and various other unions, have suggested, at a minimum to the construction, hospitality and social care sectors, where abuse and exploitation are the norm? I have seen it with my own eyes in care homes, where migrant workers&#151;now some 28 per cent of the workforce&#151;who speak little English and work appalling hours for below the minimum wage are dispirited and living in poor conditions. They are then expected, by us, to care for our nearest and dearest.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09102776000284"></a>There is one further point. Some organisations, notably the ECCR and Strangers into Citizens, are calling for one-off regularisation of long-term irregular migrant workers in the UK. Belgium is doing just this as a one-off action, running from mid-September this year to December. It is expected to bring thousands of undocumented migrants back within the scope of the protection of the law. Ireland, where I live for part of the year, has recognised the need to do the same. The Irish Minister for Justice, Dermot Ahern, announced on 15 September that bridging visas giving temporary legal residence for four months will be available for people who have become undocumented through no fault of their own.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09102776000285"></a>Will the Minister assure the House that the UK Government will look at the moves being made in Belgium and Ireland and see whether we could do something similar? Will he also assure the House that he will take seriously the real and deep concern of us all that asking the GLA to consider the immigration status of employees is militating against the most vulnerable of workers, who are caught in a net not of their own making and are often very frightened?</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09102776000287"></a>The subject of vulnerable migrant workers&#146; rights is attracting increasing attention. This is not just because of some of the well-publicised tragedies, such as the deaths of 23 cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay, which the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, mentioned. As  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>she rightly said, opinion was mixed on that subject as people felt very sorry for the cockle pickers but were not at all sure that they should have been here. However, she also rightly said that this country benefits immensely from migration of all kinds.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09102776000288"></a>I detect that we are talking about at least three sets of people: the transient workers; those who are here on a much longer term basis, who are basically settlers but are also subject to exploitation, partly as a result of having poor skills in relation to being able to protect themselves and their rights; and a third group, which can comprise some of the other two, most particularly the first, who have become involved in a web of illegal activity in that they carry out illegal activity but are also exploited. We should all be concerned about the growth in organised crime committed on our soil.</p>

<a name="91027-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09102776000289"></a>The point was well made, I believe by the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, that people who come to this country are often given totally misleading information about what they are likely to encounter and what their legitimate expectations should be. When they get to this country, they discover that the situation is extraordinarily different. Many of these people are not in a position to protect their rights as they have poor language skills, very little knowledge, and there is nobody to help them. As has been said on these Benches, we need to consider the whole question of helping people to acquire English language skills, which makes them more effective workers and helps them to protect themselves. They become more resilient citizens sooner and that must be in the general interest.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09102776000290"></a>The scale of the challenge is significant. While net immigration into the UK last year was 44 per cent lower than in the previous year, the number of people who came in&#151;more than 118,000&#151;is still far from insignificant. It is a mistake to think that only illegal immigration, which I shall come to in a moment, results in the exploitation of migrants. The UK&#146;s threat assessment for serious and organised crime says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="09102776000404"></a>&#147;Legal migrants are also vulnerable to various forms of exploitation, especially those from the new European Union ... member states as they represent a large proportion of economic migrants and can work legally without a visa, therefore not requiring facilitation or false documentation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102776000332"></a>Paradoxically, this makes them more rather than less vulnerable to exploitative employers because they are easy to pick up. You do not have to do a great deal about covering your tracks; you can take them in because they are here legally. The Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum has found that poor language skills&#151;this makes workers vulnerable even though they may be skilled&#151;and a lack of awareness of their rights are key factors in the vulnerability of migrant workers. It is very important that we should not just care for these people but help them to help themselves. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us how the Government are trying to raise awareness of workers&#146; rights in EU states before people come to the UK.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09102776000291"></a>Many noble Lords have noted that there are also problems with organised immigration crime. A particularly vivid picture of that was painted by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger. People-smuggling and human trafficking are particularly odious forms of organised crime as  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1152"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they deal in human lives. People are treated like commodities, as if they were inanimate property. Exploitation is characteristic of both the immigration process and the subsequent treatment. Human trafficking is defined by the intention to exploit illegal immigrants once they are here. They do not bring these people in and then dump them; they bring them in to subsequently exploit what they can get out of them. Even when these individuals are willing participants in their own smuggling, the UK&#146;s threat assessment notes that they can,</p>
<ul><a name="09102776000408"></a>&#147;become victims of trafficking during their journey or find themselves vulnerable to exploitation on arrival at their destination&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102776000333"></a>We know this, and we need to try to do something about it.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09102776000292"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds said two interesting things. First, he talked about people without skills, but secondly also in this category are people who are not necessarily being directly exploited by organised criminals, but who have skills and are not able to use them. They come here on a different basis and they find that there are barriers, such as doctors whom we cannot employ. They lose and we lose. Personal unhappiness, misery and decline can result. It seems to me that there is a lot that we could do in individual instances as well as in general policy to ease some of these difficulties.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09102776000293"></a>The think tank CentreForum has said that there are an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants in Britain, who are largely working in the underground economy. There are suggestions of amnesty for these individuals, which is a difficult issue. There are those who consider that it sends out the wrong message to give amnesty to such people, and others think that it is a humane way of dealing with the existing situation. I would be interested in the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09102776000294"></a>I shall come to the question of those who are engaged in exploiting people. The UK is beginning to look like a rather attractive place to people who are involved in immigration crime. I will give some examples. Of the 19 people who were convicted of trafficking for sexual exploitation in 2008, four received suspended sentences. In that year, there were only four convictions for trafficking for the purpose of forced labour. There is a question mark over those convictions. The average sentence for human trafficking is just 4.69 years. The final figure to note is that of the 3,200 employers of illegal immigrants who were arrested in 2008, only 14 were successfully prosecuted. Do we not all think that part of the key to bringing down the levels of exploitation is to go after those who are really engaged in that exploitation? Some are themselves victims, but there are a significant number who are not victims and who are knowingly exploiting people. They are making money out of it and they do not care about the effects of their actions.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09102776000295"></a>One of the keys to enforcement must be a more rigorous use of investigation and the judicial process. It is all very well laying a burden, as it is right to, on employers to make sure that their employees are there legally and have a right to work, but it is also important that the authorities follow up when they discover that illegality is going on. We need to use the courts. I would be grateful to the Minister if he could give us a  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1153"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commentary on the figures that I have just cited. The UK needs to get much more serious than it is at present about detecting and prosecuting organised immigration crime. The sentencing also ought to reflect our values about human life more closely than it seems to. It seems to me that in many respects the sentencing is not more severe than it is for property-related convictions.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09102776000296"></a>There are some gaps in the law. Last year, the Government dropped measures to increase civil penalties for employers found using illegal labour that had appeared in the draft immigration and citizenship Bill. A number of noble Lords rightly mentioned that the Coroners and Justice Bill presents us with another opportunity to tackle these issues by creating a clear offence of holding a person in servitude or subjecting them to forced or compulsory labour. Matrix Chambers has confirmed how important this is, stating that,</p>
<ul><a name="09102776000409"></a>&#147;the existing criminal law offences pertaining to trafficking, the slave trade, false imprisonment and kidnapping are not apt to cover all offences of servitude&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102776000334"></a>This point was mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. I would be grateful if the Minister will outline the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09102776000297"></a>Discussion of the sex sector leads me to my last point. A number of noble Lords have talked about extending the remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. One noble Lord rightly mentioned that the authority had been effective in reducing the level of exploitation in the sectors that it covered. Proposals have been made to extend the authority&#146;s remit. We understand the motivation for this and are sympathetic to it. However, we must be careful, particularly in a recession, that we do not drive up costs in sectors such as hospitality, with its implications for waiters&#146; wages, and thereby drive more people underground to earn less. We must be careful how we do it, because costs are an issue.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09102776000298"></a>Overall, we must seek a better policy balance between enforcing the law and treating individuals who are victims of these rapacious activities with sympathy and understanding. Will the Minister say how the Government will improve the enforcement of legislation in this area? There are other aspects to the problem, particularly ensuring that those who consciously, willingly and deliberately engage in exploitation of humans and are part of people-trafficking rings should suffer the penalties of the law. They are a big pull factor for illegal migration. If they are dealt with, we will be able to deal more readily with other policies that flow from their actions.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09102776000300"></a>It might be useful to start with our definition. A vulnerable worker is defined by the Government as someone working in an environment where the risk of being denied employment rights is high, and who does  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not have the capacity to protect themselves from that abuse. Both these factors must be present. It could be someone who has a poor knowledge of their rights, someone who is not fluent in English or someone who is dependent on their employer for accommodation. If that worker&#146;s employer exploits this weakness and the person has nowhere to go for help, they are vulnerable. If there is no human resources department to go to or union to talk to, they will be a vulnerable worker. The question for the Government is how best to protect vulnerable workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09102776000301"></a>In the fascinating debate that we have had, a number of proposals have been made, which I will come to. However, if noble Lords will forgive me, I will avoid trespassing on matters that we will debate in the Coroners and Justice Bill in the next 24 hours&#151;I would not be thanked by anyone for going down that road.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09102776000302"></a>The Government are saying that there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law. Migrant workers with an entitlement to work in the UK have rights like any other workers. We have launched a major programme to support vulnerable workers following the report of the business department&#146;s Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum, published last year. The programme is being implemented to raise vulnerable worker awareness of basic employment rights, as was mentioned by one noble Lord, and to ensure that those rights are enforced effectively.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09102776000303"></a>The first thing that we have done is to streamline access to the enforcement bodies, and I am delighted to see my noble friend Lord Young sitting in his place. In September he launched a new, free, single enforcement helpline known as the Pay and Work Rights Helpline. In case <I>Hansard</I> is read more widely than we imagine, I should say that the number is 0800 917 2368. This replaced five separate helplines, and the new line enables workers to obtain information and advice, and report abuses, all via one number. It covers the national and agricultural minimum wages, working time infringements and potential abuses of employment agency and gangmaster regulations&#151;something that we have heard quite a lot about in this debate. As proof that some of the anecdotal evidence put forward tonight is supported by others, I am pleased to say that it is effective, as it receives 600 calls a day. On the other hand, I am not so pleased, as that shows that there is a real problem.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09102776000304"></a>I was also pleased that when the helpline was launched it secured strong backing from organisations that do a lot of work with vulnerable people&#151;Citizens Advice, the Trades Union Congress and others&#151;which saw it as a very valuable new tool in seeking to protect vulnerable workers. It makes it easier for workers to report abuses and, of course, for the Government to respond.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09102776000305"></a>An understanding of English is something that we wish to see. Now, under the five-tier system, people coming to Britain are expected to have basic English but that is not the case with many vulnerable migrant workers. Translation facilities in more than 100 languages are available for all who need them so that migrant workers can report abuses and we can take them on board and seek to resolve them. This measure is

We are using national newspapers, as well as women&#146;s magazines and radio advertising, and those are supplemented by face-to-face advertising in selected locations and specific ethnic-minority communities.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09102776000306"></a>A strand of the campaign is aimed at new Europeans, by which I mean those who joined the EU some years ago&#151;a point also mentioned by noble Lords&#151;be they Lithuanians, Slovaks, Poles, Bulgarians, Latvians or what have you. Awareness-raising material has been produced in these languages and is being published in relevant media for those migrant communities. We are also focusing on spreading the message within communities by sending mail-outs to community leaders, business organisations and the relevant embassies.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09102776000307"></a>We have also ensured that workers coming to the UK following the 2004 accession, and the subsequent accession of Bulgaria and Romania, have been provided with information concerning both their rights and their responsibilities. We have offered to work with the Governments of all the new member states&#151;a valuable point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones&#151;to ensure that people know before they go that this is not a country where the streets are paved with gold, and that people seeking to separate them from large amounts of hard-earned money in their own countries to be smuggled here are providing a totally false prospectus. To date, we have also produced leaflets in partnership with the Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian and Portuguese Governments aimed at ensuring that all potential migrants are aware of both their rights and their responsibilities before they leave their country. Indeed, we reinforce that on their arrival into the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09102776000308"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked what we are doing to toughen up enforcement of the existing laws. In particular, we want to see the enforcement of employment rights. We have strengthened the penalties for failing to comply with employment law in order to increase the deterrent effect. Provisions in the Employment Act 2008, which came into effect this April, introduced automatic penalties for non-compliance with the national minimum wage. These have already been used more than 80 times. In the first quarter of this financial year, HM Revenue and Customs, which enforces the minimum wage, identified over &#163;2 million of arrears owed to more than 6,000 workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09102776000309"></a>The Act also brought in changes making employment agency regulations indictable so they can be tried in a Crown Court, where tougher penalties are available. Perhaps that meets the concern that we need to move to tougher penalties and enforcement.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09102776000310"></a>Significant effort has been put into the profile of the employment and enforcement agencies, particularly the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, which previously lacked visibility. We doubled the number of inspectors from 12 to 24. A major advertising campaign was launched which promoted awareness of agency-worker protections and the role of the EAS. It is carrying out intelligence-led blitzes and is having increasing success in returning money to workers who have had pay illegally withheld. Twice the amount has been recovered this year compared with the previous year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09102776000311"></a>Criticism was voiced by noble Lords about the need for more joined-up action and better and effective collaboration between the enforcement agencies. Action is being taken to address legal barriers which, in some cases, constrain the extent to which enforcement officers can share information with each other about potentially non-compliant employers. An amendment in last year&#146;s Employment Act, which took effect in April, established an information gateway between the national minimum wage and employment agency inspectors. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is currently consulting on proposals for a legislative reform order to amend primary legislation to address the limited number of remaining barriers. We are already seeing better targeted and effective enforcement action with enforcement bodies increasingly acting as the eyes and ears for each other, and collaborating to make best use of the enforcement powers that are available.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09102776000312"></a>It might be appropriate at this point to turn to the question raised by my noble friend Lord Parekh and the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, on the GLA interface with the UK Border Agency and exchange of information. The Government believe that the GLA needs to share information with the UK Border Agency on immigration status because it is likely that an immigration offence is being committed by the employer. Without that information, action would be difficult to take. There are new resource requirements for an extension of the GLA and in many other areas. The Government are putting new resources for compliance and enforcement from the migration impacts fund, which include around &#163;3 million over two years to workplace enforcement bodies. The HM Revenue and Customs has a project establishing a dedicated team to respond to problems in hotspots where there is evidence that employers are using migrant labour to undercut legitimate employers by paying below the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09102776000313"></a>The HSE is undertaking projects to increase awareness of health and safety law among migrant groups, particularly in construction and agriculture. The GLA is taking on five enforcement officers to work in communities in Lincolnshire, Devon, Cornwall, Cambridge, London and the south-east to ensure that migrant workers&#146; employment rights are enforced. There is also a union modernisation fund commitment that supports the building industry unions in their work with vulnerable migrant workers. We have set out details of oversight, to ensure that those involved at all levels have part of the control of how we deal with the problem. A further employment enforcement board is chaired by the Employment Relations Minister in another place and brings together the enforcement bodies and the key external stakeholders, such as the CBI, TUC and Citizens Advice. It meets regularly to help drive the Government&#146;s vulnerable worker programme and to encourage more joint working and collaboration between enforcement agencies.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09102776000314"></a>The point was made several times about the extension of GLA licensing. There was broad support for that from a number of quarters. There was also considerable praise for the work of the GLA, which I would share. However, we have to understand that 25 per cent of gangmasters remain unlicensed and, ironically, in the industry that was the raison d&#146;être for the creation of  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1157"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the GLA&#151;the foreshore industry, as it came out of the tragedy of the cockle-pickers&#151;90 per cent of gangmaster operations are still not licensed. A priority for the GLA is to move from registration to effective enforcement of the existing law, which means enforcement of the national minimum wage, employment agency status, work time, tax, health and safety, and all the other regulations that would apply irrespective of whether licensing is in place.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09102776000315"></a>It would not be accurate to say&#151;indeed, no one did&#151;that employment sectors outside those covered by the GLA are not regulated. They are regulated by the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. They are also subject to inspections by HM Revenue and Customs, the HSE and other workplace bodies, irrespective of whether they are registered or not.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09102776000316"></a>The EAS responds to all complaints and carries out targeted risk-based proactive inspections. It sees its approach of spot checks as the most intelligent way of dealing with the problems that exist. As regards taking the GLA model across all industries, the Government are not convinced that the licensing of gangmasters&#151;for example, those operating in construction&#151;would be a targeted, proportionate or effective way of tackling safety challenges in the construction sector. It would have only a minor effect on health and safety outcomes, as under construction health and safety legislation duty holders have a legal responsibility of their own irrespective of their employment status. Equal protection is provided to all. In particular, the principal or main contractor has responsibilities for ensuring the health and safety of all individuals who work on a construction site, irrespective of the formal employer. I am also told that it would have a limited impact because only about 3 per cent of construction workers are agency workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09102776000317"></a>However, I want to reassure the House that the Government are keeping the issue in the construction sector under close review and are taking targeted steps to tackle the problem. These include joint consultation with HM Revenue and Customs on proposals for tackling false self-employment. The proposed tax changes will lead to a more appropriate treatment of workers and a culture of responsible employers applying employment rights. The HSE has recently recruited more than 20 new inspectors with construction industry backgrounds to support the work of existing inspectors.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09102776000318"></a>There are many other points that I want to address but, recognising the limited time at my disposal, I will look to some that I have not covered so far. The major issue, which is difficult and has been around for some time, was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich&#151;the question of an amnesty. There are those who favour it and those who believe that it is a one-off solution. Unfortunately there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the pull of an amnesty will only encourage more people to seek not only to be legal migrants but to be illegal migrants on the grounds that once you get in, at some stage you will be legalised. We know the difficulties  


<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1158"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column 1158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we already have at the borders and why we have a strong system of resisting entry to those who should not legally be allowed in. Therefore, the Government remain unconvinced that an amnesty provides a solution.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09102776000319"></a>My noble friend Lord Haskel made a good point that is often lost in our discussions about the European Union. It is that we enjoy a two-way freedom. We hear that there is a danger of EU nationals coming here and perhaps threatening British jobs. I endorse the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, and others who said that this country owes a tremendous amount to migrants. I am the son of migrants, albeit from the Irish Republic, who claim to be part of Britain. I have to say that given my grandfather&#146;s political sentiments, he would never have claimed that. However, my noble friend Lord Haskel made the point that we have a two-way street. Not only do 6 million people go on holiday to Europe every year, but more than 580,000 Brits work in Europe. British firms have some 47,000 British people working in all parts of Europe&#151;in the new emerging countries and also in the older established EU countries. Therefore, when talking about migration, we often forget the advantages for workers in this country of being able to migrate to other parts of Europe.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09102776000320"></a>An important point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger&#151;namely that there is a link between illegal migration, exploitation and crime. We saw it classically in the case of the cockle pickers, but it is not the only one.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09102776000321"></a>Interestingly enough, in my previous incarnation as director of the International Labour Organisation in London, I had people saying to me, &#147;Isn&#146;t it disturbing&#148;, when someone in Scotland who had exploited about 600 people was not put in prison for trafficking or for the exploitation. He went to prison for a considerable period&#151;I think that it was eight years&#151;but the point is that he was not charged with those offences for the simple reason that there were other offences for which he could be charged that would guarantee that he would spend a long time at Her Majesty's pleasure that were easier to prosecute than the charge of exploitation of workers.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09102776000322"></a>That was to the chagrin of people who wanted to show that the law would protect workers. It had the effect of taking the person out of the exploitation and therefore releasing a lot of people from his evil grip, but there is the issue of crime. That is why we must continue to have both strong borders and a strong managed migration policy and, at the same time, recognise that people who come to this country are indeed equal in front of the law as legal migrants and have all the same rights, and ensure that those rights will be enforced as they would be for British citizens.</p>

<a name="91027-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09102776000323"></a>I know that I have missed a number of points. I will look very carefully at <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and write to noble Lords on any of the points that I missed or, indeed, any points that would benefit from amplification.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09102780000003"></a><b><a name="91027-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09102780000055"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09102780000004"></a>On 18 September the Ministry of Justice published the consultation paper entitled <I>Administration and Enforcement R</I><I>estriction Orders: Setting the P</I><I>arameters</I>. I have today deposited copies of the consultation paper in the Libraries of both Houses, in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office and on the internet at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk">www.justice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09102780000005"></a>This was a formal consultation exercise undertaken by the Ministry of Justice to discuss the areas where secondary legislation will be used to establish the constraints and limits required for the effective operation of the revised administration order (AO) and the enforcement restriction order (ERO) schemes. These are contained in chapters 1 and 2 of part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act (TCEA) 2007.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09102780000006"></a>Responses were received from various sectors of the community including the creditor, debt advice, legal and government sectors as well as individuals, and were generally supportive of the proposals.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09102780000007"></a>However, due to the need for supporting IT changes in the county courts it will not be possible to introduce the reformed AO scheme and the ERO until April 2011, at the earliest. This would result in delay in providing help and support to debtors.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09102780000008"></a>The ERO would only be available to those who have experienced a sudden, unforeseen change in circumstances from which they are likely to recover within six months but it has become clear that this is not fully understood and there is a significant risk that large numbers of debtors might apply for an ERO, without considering the requirement for evidence of recovery in the short-term, in the mistaken belief that it will be available to them.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09102780000009"></a>If debtors apply for an ERO in inappropriate circumstances, this could worsen their position as:</p>
if awarded, interest will continue to be added to the debt;if not awarded, they will have wasted time in identifying an appropriate workable solution; and
<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09102780000010"></a>it would place a significant strain on HMCS as these would be priority hearings, which need to be heard on the same day as the application is received.</p>

<notus-date day="27" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS94"></a><b>27 Oct 2009 : Column WS94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09102780000012"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the latest in the series of quarterly Statements to the House about the inquests of service personnel and others who have died overseas. We cannot express highly enough the regard in which we continue to hold our service personnel who are serving, or who have served, in the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our deepest sympathies lie with the families of those personnel who have lost their lives in these operations. It is a cause of particular sadness that since our last Statement a further 47 service personnel have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09102780000013"></a>Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 15 July 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 30WS), with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at 16 October.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09102780000014"></a>The tables which accompany this Statement again include information about those cases which involve a board of inquiry or a service inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09102780000016"></a>At the time of the last Statement, we reported that up to 6 July 241 inquests had been held since June 2006, 227 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09102780000017"></a>Since 6 July a further 19 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 260 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09102780000018"></a>Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 284 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including four service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09102780000019"></a>We remain deeply grateful for the efforts of all the coroners who are involved in conducting these inquests, and totally committed in our support for the independent coronial system.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09102780000020"></a>Our departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the coroners&#146; legislation which is currently before Parliament in the Coroners and Justice Bill, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>

It is helpful that the district continues to benefit from the experience and expertise of David Masters, who retired as coroner on 31 March but has been appointed as an assistant deputy coroner by his successor, David Ridley.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09102780000026"></a>There are 105 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007 (64 involving deaths in the past six months). Of these, Mr Ridley has retained 56 inquests, whilst 47 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin, and two inquest transfers are pending. At 16 October one recent fatality had been repatriated but the inquest was yet to be opened. Hearing dates have been set in 13 of these cases.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09102780000029"></a>We shall continue to keep the House informed about progress with the remaining inquests. I have placed tables in the Library of the House which outline the status of all cases and the date of death in each case.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09102780000031"></a>I am today announcing action to further the Government&#146;s commitment to ensure decisions on local matters are made as close to the people affected by them as possible.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09102780000032"></a>First, following consultation I am proposing to change the rules about how certain by-laws are made, so that councils and their communities will be able to address local issues through by-laws without needing permission from Whitehall. I intend to seek the approval of each House to the necessary regulations under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. I am also proposing that councils should be able to enforce certain by-laws through fixed penalty notices, and I intend to make and lay before the House the necessary regulation to provide for this.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09102780000034"></a>As part of the same concerted drive, I also intend that my department will publish a consultation on proposals to either repeal or dramatically streamline more than half of the consent regimes my department is responsible for&#151;relating to, for example, housing and land use, which currently require councils to seek government approval before acting.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09102780000039"></a>The following options are currently available to support people with debt problems:</p>
 county court administration orders (for those with unsecured debts below &#163;5,000), bankruptcy, individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs), time orders (for debts regulated by the Consumer Credit Act), the debt relief order (for those with unsecured debts below &#163;15,000, disposable income below &#163;50 p.m. and assets of less than &#163;300) and non-court based debt management/repayment plans operated by both the commercial and not-for-profit sectors.
<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09102780000040"></a>Additionally other initiatives have been introduced to provide further assistance including:</p>
the new practice direction covering pre-action creditor behaviour (developed by the Civil Justice Council), introduced on 6 April, requires all business creditors to provide consumers with information about how to contact them to assist direct negotiation, details of free advice providers and a requirement to allow time for advice to be given where this is the chosen course; andthe Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has reached agreement with the credit card and debt collection sectors that those facing payment problems will be offered a minimum 30-day breathing space to make progress in getting their affairs in order once they have engaged with a debt advice agency.

The paper puts forward a number of options and explains the advantages and disadvantages to debtors, creditors and debt management scheme providers of each of these options. This will enable stakeholders to make a fully informed decision about which option would both deliver a speedy resolution to a broad range of debt problems experienced by a wide range of people and allow creditors to recover their debts wherever possible.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09102780000042"></a>In considering whether action is required, the Government will be guided by the following objectives:</p>
helping people who could, but are struggling to, repay their debts; ensuring that fees charged by debt management schemes providers are reasonable and consistent; ending the practice of some creditors adding interest to debts included in a repayment plan; preserving the best features of the current debt management industry;ensuring that needs of debtors, creditors and providers are correctly balanced; andensuring that debtors are aware of the range of options available to them and are advised on the most appropriate and sustainable solution(s) for their circumstances.
<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09102780000043"></a>The intention is to ensure that</p>

will receive advice about all the options available to them;they will know how much needs to be repaid because creditor interest and charges would be stopped;will know roughly how long this will take&#151;but this may vary due to changes of circumstances;the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 allows for the possible composition of debts. The consultation paper asks questions about whether this is needed;will be protected from enforcement&#151;without permission of the court;will not be forced to realise assets; andwill not be harassed by creditors.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09102780000045"></a><I>Creditors</I></p>
may have their debts paid in full&#151;possibly minus operators&#146; charges;will not need to chase debts;will have information presented to them in a common format; andwill be confident that they are receiving the maximum possible monthly instalment.
<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09102780000046"></a>If the consultation results in the introduction of a code of best practice or the approved DMS, it could be possible to introduce these as early as 2010, depending on parliamentary time. This would deliver early support for debtors.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="09102780000047"></a><b><a name="91027-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09102780000059"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Justice (Maria Eagle) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09102780000048"></a>On 27 April, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice made a Statement on prisons and probation, in which he announced plans to build five new 1,500-place prisons. The Secretary of State for Justice announced the preferred location for the first two sites: one on the site of the former Runwell Secure Psychiatric Hospital in Essex and one at Beam Park West, Dagenham.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09102780000049"></a>I am pleased to announce today that we are starting a fresh search for sites on which to build new 1,500-place prisons. This search will be more open and transparent than previous searches and we will be asking local authorities, landowners and other interested parties to identify potential sites. We will look across the country for sites to serve areas with greatest demand for prison places. The search will be focused on London, the north-west, north Wales, and West Yorkshire. Finding the most appropriate place for a new prison is of paramount importance. They should be located in those areas where there is the greatest need, areas where the greater number of prisoners come from.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09102780000050"></a>This will allow us to keep prisoners closer to their home areas and will help ensure that important family and other links can be maintained, which helps prisoner rehabilitation. As part of this search, we will announce our interest in an identified site and will consult with all interested parties.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09102780000051"></a>Crime has fallen by more than a third since 1997, with 70 per cent more violent and dangerous offenders locked up, and for longer. We have already created 25,000 additional prison places in the past 12 years and we are committed to providing sufficient prison places to hold serious and persistent offenders, who rightly should be behind bars.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09102780000052"></a>These new prisons will allow us to modernise the estate by closing down older, inefficient and worn-out places. They will help protect the public and make communities safer by providing regimes to punish and reform offenders.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09102780000053"></a>Once a prison is established in an area, almost without exception the local community becomes very supportive of it. A prison is a source of secure, well paid employment and a focus for much volunteering. The research evidence which shows that prisons have no adverse effect on house prices or crime rates is then borne out by experience. But proposals for new prisons can at first be controversial, which is why this new site search will be more open and transparent than previous searches, and we will publish a shortlist of potential sites.</p>

<a name="91027-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09102780000054"></a>Once a site is identified, consultation with local MPs, local authorities and residents will be undertaken in order to achieve the most open and transparent process possible. Once consultation has concluded, we will seek to acquire that site with an appropriate planning consent.</p>

The Government have taken measures to promote parental employment as the best route out of poverty, because there is clear evidence that moving into and progressing in work offers benefits to parents and children alike, including but not restricted to, additional income from earnings&#151;a child's risk of poverty is 61 per cent in a workless household and reduces to 15 per cent if at least one parent is working. Work is also associated with wider benefits, for example in terms of health, well-being and autonomy, aspirations and self-esteem. The introduction of the national minimum wage, as well as working tax credits, has ensured that the minimum income guarantee has increased by almost 30 per cent since April 1999 in real terms. Also Train to Gain, the Government's flagship training service for employers, has enabled employees to develop their skills, which will help them to progress in work.</p>

<a name="91027w0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_184"></a><a name="09102779000197"></a>The Government's position is that it aims to help parents into work, and acquire the skills and training they need for well-paid jobs that support children and families, whilst also ensuring that work is family-friendly so that parents can combine employment and parental responsibilities.</p>

<a name="91027w0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_185"></a><a name="09102779000198"></a>To support families, the Government have taken action to increase and extend maternity leave and pay, and introduce paid paternity leave. A new right to request flexible working for those with parental responsibility for children under 16 (or 18, if disabled) has been introduced to help parents combine work and family responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_186"></a><a name="09102779000199"></a>The Government have also taken substantial steps to support parents in work by increasing the number of childcare places that are available&#151;at March 2009, the stock of registered childcare places stood at over 1.5 million places (more than double the 1997 level). Over &#163;25 billion has been invested on early years and childcare in England since 1997, and there are over 3,000 Sure Start Children's Centres now open, providing integrated early years' services (including childcare) to over 2.4 million young children under 5 and their families.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_187"></a><a name="09102779000200"></a>These and other measures put in place by the Government have lifted 500,000 children out of poverty since 1997. However, 2.9 million children remain in poverty, 1.5 million of which live in households with at least one person working. The Government are looking at ways to reduce in-work poverty by helping parents move into higher paid work, through skills and training for individuals and promoting the uptake of skills by employers, and also by promoting the availability of high-quality, affordable childcare. Increased working hours can help lift children out of poverty&#151;either by the primary earner increasing hours from part-time to full-time hours, or with the introduction of a second earner into the household. However, the Government's approach is to support and incentivise parents into work, whilst respecting family preferences.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_189"></a><a name="09102779000202"></a>The Government introduced the Child Poverty Bill into Parliament in June which will enshrine in law the commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020. The Bill will ensure that all levels of government, now and in the future, play a role in tackling child poverty. The Bill also requires the Government to prepare a strategy, to be refreshed every three years, which will set out the policies that will be put in place to meet the child poverty targets. The issue of tackling in-work poverty whilst maintaining a high quality of life for the child and the family will be addressed in the strategy.</p>

It is not possible to extract historical information for the Criminal Justice Group from the Home Office's records prior to 2008-09, meaning that the figures for headquarters below are not directly comparable between the financial years<sup>***</sup>.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1156"></a><a name="09102779001189"></a>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what is the total number of life years lost in England and Wales in each of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 for those dying prematurely of: (a) short-, medium- or long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10), (b) alcohol abuse, (c) drug abuse, (d) road traffic accidents,  (e) obesity, and (f) smoking.

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1157"></a><a name="09102779001190"></a>The accurate reporting of deaths by specific causes depends on the complete recording of all relevant causes of death by medical practitioners and coroners. Medical practitioners are required to complete the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) to the best of their knowledge and belief. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded. The MCCD is not designed to collect information on risk factors or exposures related to the development of disease, such as exposure to particulate matter or smoking behaviour. It is therefore not possible to provide answers to parts (a) or (f) of the question above, based on information collected at death registration.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1158"></a><a name="09102779001191"></a>Calculations done for the review of the Air Quality Strategy<sup>1</sup> estimated that, if all man-made fine particulate matter (PM2.5) present in the UK in 2005 were removed for the lifetime of people born in 2005, the average life-expectancy per person would be 7-8 months greater than if the level of man-made PM2.5 had remained at 2005 levels for a lifetime. This calculation represents the effect of long-term exposure to fine particles. A similar calculation has not been done for PM10 since the evidence that it is a good metric for representing the effect of long-term exposure is much weaker<sup>2</sup> than for PM2.5.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1159"></a><a name="09102779001192"></a>Studies of short-term exposure to PM10 do suggest a link with increased mortality but the studies do not give direct information on the life lost per person. It is thought that those affected are already seriously ill but that many of the deaths are brought forward by several months rather than just days or weeks. There are too few studies of the effects of medium term exposure for calculations such as those above to be made. All information on the estimated impact of particulate matter on life expectancy and mortality has been

Neither ONS nor the HPA are aware of comparable figures to those provided above for 2006-08.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1160"></a><a name="09102779001193"></a>ONS publishes annual figures on the number of years of life lost due to a selection of specific causes  of death<sup>3</sup> , including land transport accidents. Table 1 below presents figures for years of life lost due to land transport accidents, including the number of deaths, mean age at death and years of total life (to age 75) lost, by sex, for 2005 to 2007 (the latest year available). Figures are not readily available for years of life lost due to alcohol abuse, drug abuse or obesity.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1161"></a><a name="09102779001194"></a>Figures are available for the number of premature deaths, defined as deaths under the age of 75, for  (i) deaths with an alcohol-related cause, (ii) drug misuse deaths, where the underlying cause was drug poisoning and where any drug controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was mentioned on the death certificate, and (iii) deaths with obesity as the underlying cause of death, for England and Wales, for 2005 to 2008 (the latest year available), and are provided in Table 2 below. These figures are presented to offer some information on the scale of premature deaths from these conditions, in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="91027w0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1162"></a><a name="09102779001195"></a>The figures provided in Table 2 relating to obesity reflect the number of deaths certified as due to obesity conditions. However, these figures are likely to underestimate the actual number of deaths in which this factor is involved since obesity may play an important role in deaths due to other conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, but it is rarely recorded on the death certificate.</p>
