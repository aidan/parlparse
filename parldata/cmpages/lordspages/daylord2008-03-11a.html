Since the <I>Times</I> tells us this morning that 70 per cent of the population want a referendum, since another poll tells us that 89 per cent of those polled believe that the Lisbon treaty is the constitution, since it contains 240 out of 242 of the provisions which were in the constitutional treaty, and since every European leader bar the leaders in the other place in Britain say that it is identical to the constitutional treaty&#151;including the father of the whole thing, Val&#233;ry Giscard D&#146;Estaing&#151;would it not be much better to save ourselves enormous trouble and have a referendum straightaway on it? If it is such a marvellous thing for the British people, surely the Government can trust the British people to come to the right answer on it.</p>

I will not have figures bandied around about referendums. I am sure that the noble Lord has studied the figures, as I did. If he looks at the 88.8 per cent from the referendums that took place in the 10 marginals, he will know that of those voting less than one-fifth of the electorate&#151;19.8 per cent of people&#151;were actually in favour of a referendum. That is a substantial difference from the 88.8 per cent being bandied around. Equally, I will be able to quote&#151;indeed, I look forward to it&#151;figures about referendums over the past 20, 30 and 40 years. When invited, the population indeed enjoy the opportunity to talk about the use of referendums, but we are absolutely crystal clear that this is a reform treaty and, as with other reform treaties, it is Parliament&#146;s job to ratify it. That is what we are here to do.</p>

The Government support the drive to encourage students to take up engineering careers, working with the sector skills councils and professional institutions. Programmes include Science and Engineering Ambassadors, the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology and other activities. The Office of Government Commerce has established systems providing information about future government demand and the interrelationship of major programmes. Departments undertake assessments of demand and capacity to inform their budget decisions and their risk analyses.</p>

As he is probably aware, however, the stop-start approach to infrastructure projects cost the country &#163;1.8 billion last year, and with the skills and capacity shortages driving construction inflation rates even higher, that figure could reach &#163;8 billion a year by 2015. That means that by 2015 we will need each year an extra 12,000 or so engineering professionals to cope with the increasing demand and to bridge the skills gap. It also means that we need thousands more engineering undergraduates to be enrolling and starting their courses now, whereas admissions are falling.</p>

Representations are also made through the EU, as this has been found to be the most effective way of making such representations.

We do not seek to enforce returns to Iran unless our decision-making processes and the independent courts are satisfied that it is entirely safe to do so.</p>

We find this issue puzzling. I am not sure whether at the previous stage of the Bill we fully took on board the Minister&#146;s argument as to why we should discuss just carbon dioxide and any other gas specified by the Secretary of State rather than talk about greenhouse gases as a whole. We have talked about international agreements, especially in relation to aviation and shipping, it seems unusual to take a separate line here, just targeting carbon dioxide and setting out other greenhouse gases, rather than taking the IPCC&#146;s line and talking about all greenhouse gases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="080311102000084"></a>By volume, carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse cases, although methane has 32 times more effect on the atmosphere. As a greenhouse gas, methane lasts in the atmosphere for a far shorter time than carbon dioxide. There has been lobbying in the agricultural industry for certain gases; certain HFCs used for agricultural purposes have much greater effects on the atmosphere, while others are used in the power-generating sector. However, we have not been able to eliminate those and replace them with less damaging gases. I believe that it should still be the role of the committee to look closely at all greenhouse gases. One of the major greenhouse gases is methane escaping from the thawing of the tundra in

Amendment No. 96 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, seeks to define all greenhouse gases listed in Clause 73. The government&#146;s amendments go some way to solving the problem.</p>

However, going about the issue in this way seems slightly wrong. The process, as per the government amendment, must begin with the Secretary of State wanting to make an order and then seeking out the advice of the committee. We really had hoped that there would be more of a positive duty on the committee to research and determine what gases should be targeted and that it would recommend to the Secretary of State that an order was needed. Perhaps I have misread the government amendment, but could the Minister assure us that the committee will be able to consider this and make recommendations to the Government? The scientists should determine what is to be targeted in the first instance and not be used as a sort of approval process for the Secretary of State&#146;s statutory instrument.</p>

First, I shall comment on Amendments Nos. 96 and 98 and then speak to the government amendments in the group. Amendments Nos. 96 and 98 would include the basket of Kyoto greenhouse gases in the Bill&#146;s targets and budgets from the start.

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="080311102000089"></a>Our key concern with these amendments is that they would pre-empt the outcome of the review. As with the proposals to move the 2050 target to 80 per cent now, these amendments propose making a decision now and getting the evidence later, or rather, making a decision now that is not based on any evidence. We consider a much more appropriate method is to address the issue the other way round, asking the independent, expert Committee on Climate Change to consider the evidence and provide us with a robust basis on which

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="080311102000090"></a>Amendment No. 101 would mean that an order including other greenhouse gases could only make amendments to the Act that were completely necessary to the Act&#146;s operation rather than ones that are merely convenient. For instance, if other greenhouse gases were included in our budgets a future Government might want to rename them &#147;greenhouse gas budgets&#148; for clarity, rather than &#147;carbon budgets&#148;. This kind of simple change would be prevented by Amendment No. 101, which we feel is far too restrictive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="080311102000091"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 97 and 104, which go with government Amendment No. 102, which we have already discussed, do two things. First, they allow us to include other greenhouse gases in a budget period which has already started. This could include the very first budget period, for 2008-12. Secondly, they increase the robustness and transparency of the process for taking decisions on whether and how to include other greenhouse gases. As I have said, the Committee on Climate Change will be required to consider the implications of including other greenhouse gases&#151;the six gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, set out in Clause 73, and in the targets and budgets when conducting its review of the 2050 target. The committee&#146;s review will report, and the Government will set the level of the first three budgets after the first budget period has begun. However, Clauses 19(2) and 20(3) would prevent us including other greenhouse gases in a budget period which has already begun. Government Amendments Nos. 97 and 104 remove these constraints by deleting those two subsections. Taken together, their effect would make it possible to include further greenhouse gases, using an appropriate baseline year in the very first budget period under the Bill of 2008-12.</p>

<a name="80311-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="080311102000092"></a>Today I can go further; I want to put on the record our commitment to include other greenhouse gases in our targets and budgets if the Committee on Climate Change advises in favour of this in its review of the 2050 target. If the committee advises that we should include these emissions in our targets, we will do so. Government Amendments Nos. 97 and 104 will allow us to do so right from the very first budget period. This is a new step forward, which I hope will reassure noble Lords of the Government&#146;s commitment to taking action on greenhouse gases, once we have the right evidence base on which to do so&#151;that is, advice from the experts.</p>

<a name="80311-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="080311102000093"></a>The amendments would also improve the robustness and transparency of decisions on including other greenhouse gases. In Committee I agreed to look again at whether the scrutiny arrangements in Clause 20 could be strengthened to ensure that this power is exercised appropriately. Government Amendment No. 104addresses this point by requiring the Government to consult both the Committee on Climate Change and the devolved Administrations before using the power in Clause 20 to amend the base year of a greenhouse gas. As before, this power will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. As elsewhere,

Amendment No. 104 would achieve this, together with Amendment No. 102, which has already been discussed but not yet agreed. Together, the government amendments significantly strengthen the Bill. At the appropriate time I will seek leave to move them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="080311102000107"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we come to an important principle in the Bill: the Government&#146;s concept of the UK carbon account. As noble Lords will know, that does not target actual UK emissions but UK net emissions plus or minus the trade in carbon permits from abroad, whether through the European system or some of the other Kyoto mechanisms. The amendment is intended to put a limit on the number of those foreign credits included in the UK carbon account.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="080311102000108"></a>I want to make it quite clear, as I did in Committee, that all noble Lords on all sides of the House are absolutely committed to emissions trading systems. In no way does the amendment inhibit the actual trading of permits internationally, particularly within the European Emissions Trading Scheme. All of that continues, company to company, in the current and post-2012 regimes, if the amendment is passed. As proof that this type of amendment does not affect how emissions trading schemes work, I remind your Lordships&#146; House that the Government already have a carbon dioxide emissions target for 2010 which does not allow any trading to be counted towards it. Yet that that has in no way inhibited the EU ETS and Kyoto mechanisms from working very effectively and efficiently despite that national target already being in place.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="080311102000109"></a>An important thing for all of us is that the Bill gives the United Kingdom the chance to show global leadership. That is what we all, on all sides of the House, welcomed when the Bill was announced. We all have our individual criticism of clauses and various bits of the Bill, which we are now considering. On the whole, however, it is right for the Government to bring the Bill before the House, for it to be approved and for us to show the international leadership that the Government wish. However, that can only be the case if the United Kingdom makes part of that effort itself. If, on the other hand, it decides to subcontract all its effort to meet its carbon targets to the rest of the world, that would not show a great deal of leadership and would completely undermine the ethos, motivation and practical importance of the Bill. None of us&#151;and I am sure this is true of the Government&#151;wants that to be the case.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="080311102000110"></a>The amendment does not go as far as existing government targets and say that no international credits shall be counted towards the UK carbon account and the targets in the Bill. However, we are saying that they should be reasonably limited. The amendment says in a sober and reasonable way that 70 per cent of the effort to decarbonise our economy and meet those targets must be met within the United Kingdom. That is fundamental to the understanding of the Bill in the country and within the global community, and reflects what the Government and Ministers themselves wish to do.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="080311102000111"></a>Because this is such an important principle, it needs to be in the Bill. It has to be clear in the Bill that there is a limit to the amount of decarbonisation of the UK economy that can take place by subcontracting it to the rest of the world while we carry on emitting carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases to our heart's content, to any degree that we want, as long as,

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="080311102000112"></a>We recognise that international effort is important; our contribution towards that is important. That is why there is no prohibition in the amendment. The amendment would not stop the Government purchasing as many international credits as they want to assist developing countries or other parts of the world to decarbonise their economies; it means that after a certain limit, they would not be counted towards the targets. That is all that the amendment does.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="080311102000113"></a>When I was preparing for the debate and thinking about the issue, I looked through some government pronouncements. One that was absolutely right was by Phil Woolas, a Minister in the other place, when he spoke to the Renewable Energy Association at the end of last year. What he said encapsulates what we all want. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="080311102000314"></a>&#147;The UK is also showing strong leadership through being the first country in the world to propose a Climate Change Bill, with targets to reduce CO2 by 2050&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000285"></a>that relates to the UK. He said that although the reduction,</p>
<ul><a name="080311102000349"></a>&#147;was the primary intention of the Bill, it was not the only one. The fact that we have a Climate Change Bill provides us with a vital lever in international discussion by committing us to taking real action at home&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80311-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="080311102000114"></a>I could not disagree with that statement at all. In fact, that sums up what the Bill is about. The amendment would help the Government achieve their goals. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="080311102000115"></a><b><a name="80311-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080311102000783"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I see this as a fundamental amendment with wide support across the House. I will not further extol the virtues of trading schemes and their importance to the fight against climate change, but only because that has been sufficiently covered by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and in previous debates, and because I believe that there is a strong convergence of opinion on the vital role that they can play.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="080311102000116"></a>However, how the schemes are to be included in the Bill is still the subject of much controversy. It is to that that I will direct most of my attention. The Government have come a long way since the Bill was first debated. I was pleased to see many of the amendments that the Minister tabled for Report, as they showed that the Government really seemed to have listened to the concerns expressed by noble Lords in the debates. The Government have been particularly good at strengthening the role of the committee and on beefing up some of the reporting mechanisms.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="080311102000117"></a>However, that willingness did not seem to extend to capping overseas carbon credits. Simply not enough has been done to send out a sufficiently strong signal that the Government are truly committed to decarbonisation. The noble Lord said in Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="080311102000315"></a>&#147;We will take that aspect away to see how we can modify the Bill to make it absolutely clear that we are committed to that decarbonisation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/12/07; col. 532.]</p>

<p><a name="080311102000286"></a>I simply do not feel that such a modification has been made. We certainly appreciate the Minister&#146;s averred

We want something in the Bill that shows that the Government are committed to addressing the issues of overseas credits, to ensure that the Bill is truly focused on domestic decarbonisation and will not allow the widespread buying of indulgences that will lock our economy into its dependence on carbon.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="080311102000118"></a>A fixed percentage in the Bill may not be the best way of going about that. We understand the difficulties in placing such a precise figure in the Bill, which range from the constraints of the international negotiation tables to the fact that the carbon market will look a lot different in 42 years. However, a 30 per cent limit on the contribution to the reduction commitment is fairly broad and it is the best course of action in the absence of anything from the Government. The Minister said that he envisaged the Committee on Climate Change addressing these issues. That fits into our general approach towards the Bill and the role of the committee. However, we would like the committee to have a specific duty under the Bill to set a figure capping overseas credits. Should the Government bring something to that effect forward at Third Reading, we would be willing to reconsider our position on the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="080311102000123"></a>Should the Government bring something to this effect forward at Third Reading, we would be willing to reconsider our position on the amendment. That is the important point that I wanted to get across to the Minister. Simply put, we want something in the Bill. Current thinking is that, following Kyoto, overseas credits can be supplemental to a country&#146;s reduction effort. However, the strength of the supplementarity doctrine depends on how the reduction is calculated.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="080311102000124"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the concept. What is supplemental to what? Is it supplemental to the reduction effort in terms of how far we have to go to meet the reduction in relation to the baseline year or is it supplemental to the reduction of the projected increase if we continued with business as usual? Those create very different figures. For example,  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1408"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>let us say that we are currently emitting 100 million tonnes, which must be reduced by 10 per cent in the coming five-year budget. Is the reduction effort 10 million tonnes, of which a supplemental portion would be about 5 million tonnes, or is the reduction calculated based on what we might be emitting in five years if we carried on with business as usual&#151;say 125 million tonnes&#151;which would make the reduction effort 35 million tonnes? This would mean that a supplemental percentage would be, say, 17.5 million tonnes, which would allow us to buy more than the entirety of our 10 per cent reduction. The way in which this is calculated has a substantial bearing on what caps mean. Can the Minister explain the calculation method that he envisages being used?</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="080311102000125"></a>We understand that carbon markets need a certain amount of freedom. Indeed, we understand that many of the credits purchased in the European Union could come from overseas or be the result of joint implementation initiatives and the like. The amendment would restrict not how many credits can be purchased but simply how many of the credits purchased could be counted towards the Government&#146;s emissions targets. In essence, we support the amendment, which would fill what we believe is a serious hole in the Bill. The issues of offsetting need to be addressed and, as adequate provision has been not made, placing a cap might go some way towards addressing the problem.</p>

In more than 10 years in this House, I have done so only once before, when I moved an amendment adding a public interest test to the Communications Act 2003. For that reason, I shall speak at a little greater length than has been my practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="080311102000127"></a>This is, as noble Lords have heard, a very important debate. For me, it happens to be the most important debate, because it goes to the heart of the overall rationale for the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, put his finger on this in one of our committee deliberations when he observed that this is not a carbon trading Bill; it is the Climate Change Bill, which happens to include a provision on carbon trading. The Joint Committee probably spent more time discussing the trading of carbon credits than any other single issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="080311102000128"></a>On domestic versus purchased credits, we were reassured by the wording and what we assumed to be the intent of the Kyoto protocols, which have the very clear requirement that purchased carbon credits are supplemental to domestic carbon reductions&#151;paragraphs 92 to 94 on page 34 of our report set it all out. There is no ambiguity in this unless you actively look for it. This resulted in my original concept, which was supported by an observation by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, on the radio the other day. He made the point that the 2020 target was the real challenge, which reinforced the suggestion that I have been making for a while of a 50 per cent cap, with a taper every five years from 2020 onwards, falling to around 15 per cent in 2050, by which time one would hope that the whole thing will have become academic. I am afraid that I find myself sponsoring the amendment because I had no response whatever from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="080311102000129"></a>Leaving the whole thing to the climate change committee is an attractive option but, as the Minister has reminded us on any number of occasions, these essentially political decisions should remain with Parliament. This is a defensibly consistent and principled position, but it results in the need to clarify to the greatest degree possible an appropriate cap and to put it into the Bill. Surely there can be no decision more political in effect than constraining the way in which people live their lives. In essence, given the Bill&#146;s present form, the Government are seeking to persuade us simply to trust them to do the right thing. That indicates that those who drafted the Bill do not get out too much.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="080311102000130"></a>The present clause amounts to not much more than a &#147;get out of jail free&#148; card. I am sure that that is not what was intended, but it is certainly how any objective observer will inevitably see it. Why should we suffer this lack of faith in politicians to be trusted to work things out on our behalf? Why will the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, despite our best intentions, inevitably struggle for legitimacy, working off the back of years and years of governmental compromise, inactivity and dithering in this area? How, as the Environmental Audit Committee reported last week, can green taxes, as a proportion of all taxes, have declined from a peak of 9.7 per cent in 1999 to 7.6 per cent in 2006? Why is this lack of trust so complete that the requirement to have a specific figure in the Bill becomes absolutely compelling?</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="080311102000131"></a>I think that I found at least part of the answer recently in a book entitled <I>Blessed Unrest </I>by the American environmental architect Paul Hawken. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="080311102000316"></a>&#147;We live in a faith-based economy, and by that I do not refer to religious practice. People are asked to place their faith in economic and political systems that have polluted water, air, and sea; that have despoiled communities, sacked workforces, reduced incomes for most people in the world for the past three decades, and created a stratosphere sufficiently permeated with industrial gases that we are in effect playing dice with the planet ... As that faith begins to seem more and more misplaced, the way to change the world is to change one&#146;s own practices, including one&#146;s home, source of energy, method of agriculture, diet, transport patterns, and communities. Not that Kyoto Protocols shouldn&#146;t be signed or adopted ... Efforts must continue to be directed to bring about institutional change, but such efforts cannot succeed unless people reexamine how they behave and consume in their own lives&#148;.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="080311102000132"></a>Later today, we are likely to hear arguments from those who feel strongly that in purchasing carbon offsets you are in effect helping to kick-start the benign development of what we used to call &#147;the third world&#148;. Anticipating these arguments from Peers for whom I have the greatest respect, perhaps I may offer a few counter-arguments. The first is eloquently expressed by Kevin Smith in this month&#146;s issue of <I>Resurgence</I>. He states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="080311102000317"></a>&#147;The concept underpinning the whole system of carbon trading and offsetting is that a ton of carbon here is exactly the same as a ton of carbon there. That is, if it&#146;s cheaper to reduce emissions in India than it is in the UK, then you can achieve the same climate benefit in a more cost-effective manner by making the reduction in India.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="080311102000318"></a>But the seductive simplicity of this concept is based on collapsing a whole series of important considerations, such as land rights, North-South inequalities, local struggles, corporate power and colonial history, into the single question of cost-effectiveness. The mechanisms of emissions trading and offsetting represent a reductionist approach to climate change that negates&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="080311102000133"></a>The difference in argumentation between myself and those who will speak after me may simply reflect a difference in background and personal experience. The cost-effectiveness case, with its attractive development underpinning, is advanced in the main by economists, whereas my arguments stem from my background as a film producer and, for the past six years, as president of UNICEF. My raw material is people&#151;people at their best and people at their worst. Commodify them and they tend to behave badly. Explain what needs to be done, the reasons that lie behind it and what can be done to improve things and, as often as not, they will surprise and perhaps even amaze you. We need this amendment or something very like it to force the hand of the Government, whichever Government that might be, to allow the people of this country to be good instead of simply being given the opportunity to look good. As Paul Hawken put it, to,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="080311102000134"></a>The Prime Minister continually reminds us that we have to face some tough choices. Unfortunately, these are seldom spelt out. This amendment would help unambiguously to set out the implications of where we have got to and what will be required of all of us if we are to start putting things right. I can only urge my colleagues on the Labour Benches to support what I believe to be a very important amendment.</p>

I also agree with him that the Bill is not adequate, but I cannot go the whole way with the argument that he advanced. In earlier stages of the Bill, I spoke about the importance of getting cost-effective action, including effective action in other countries, and about relating properly and effectively to the international trading mechanisms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="080311102000136"></a>Under the Kyoto rules, the practice effectively has been to place a 50 per cent limit, which has happened in the past. I do not have any difficulty about the proposal that that limit is too high and should be lowered. However, I have a good deal of sympathy with some of the arguments advanced by the Minister in papers that he circulated to those who have taken part in our debates in which he expressed doubts about setting a binding limit, which risks being seen internationally as undermining our continued commitment to maintaining low-carbon investment flows to developing countries.</p>

He suggested that perhaps we needed in the Bill a specific obligation on the Committee on Climate Change to advise on this matter. If I had not heard those remarks, I would have said something like, &#147;I can go along with 30 per cent&#151;it may be about right at the start&#151;but this is going to be a continually changing situation as international trading schemes and the whole climate in which we are dealing develop&#148;. I would have then said, &#147;Okay, if we accept a 30 per cent amendment, I hope that at a later stage in the passage of the Bill we can have a provision that that figure could be amended after advice from the Committee on Climate Change&#148;. So we are not very far apart. My noble friend made a powerful case that we should put a specific obligation on the climate change committee to address this important issue.</p>

<a name="80311-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="080311102000138"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for whom I have the utmost respect and under whose chairmanship I have now served on two Joint Committees of the House, that to fix a very low percentage and then to say that it has to go lower still in later years is anticipating the future in a way that I am not happy to do. I hope that the Minister will say, &#147;I understand exactly what is being said here&#148;. If the Government feel that they cannot accept this fixed 30 per cent but will come along with proposals that will give a strong role&#151;indeed, an inevitable and necessary role&#151;to the Committee on Climate Change so that the figure can be altered as events change, we would have a mechanism that we in all parts of the House could support.</p>

Indeed, for a period it may be a sensible figure, but, for goodness&#146; sake, as we are dealing with events up to 2050, let us not lock ourselves into a position that could prove extremely damaging. I support the general thrust of the Bill as long as we have some kind of mechanism of the type proposed by my noble friend on the Front Bench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="080311102000142"></a>My sympathy is based on the fact that it is essential that the UK achieves cuts in its own emissions and does not rely on what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has called the delusion of a get-out-of-jail-free card. That is important because it is vital that developing countries in total illustrate to the world what a low carbon economy is and what changes in behaviour, energy efficiency and the lower carbon sources of

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="080311102000143"></a>Indeed, the fact that we need to demonstrate that supports the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that it is not absolutely the case that a tonne of carbon saved in every country of the world is precisely the same. There is a value in hard emission reductions targets in developed countries because they will drive the changes in behaviour, energy efficiency and technology which will then be required across the whole world.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="080311102000144"></a>It is important to realise that in the long term, when we look at the 2050 target, we probably have to work on the assumption that all of the emission reductions we will aim to achieve by 2050 will have to be achieved through domestic effort&#151;not 90 per cent, not 95 per cent, but all. That is because by that time, all countries in the world, including those that are currently still at a low-income developing stage, will have to be on a strong downward emissions path.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="080311102000145"></a>Although it will make perfect sense to allow trading between ourselves and other countries if the whole world is in cap and trade systems, we have no basis for assuming that we will necessarily be a logical net buyer of emissions credits at that time rather than emissions seller. We therefore have to design our long-term climate change programme on the assumption that we must drive changes in behaviour, energy efficiency and the source of our energy such that it will be possible by 2050 to achieve the reduction target&#151;be it 60 per cent or 80 per cent&#151;entirely through domestic effort. That may not be how we do it, but we have to design our policy on the assumption that that may be what occurs.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="080311102000146"></a>While it is the long-term reality that that is what we have to achieve, there is a potentially significant role to be played through emissions trading in the shorter term. Where there are opportunities to reduce emissions at much lower costs elsewhere than in the developed countries, it makes sense for us to take advantage of those opportunities. There is a vital need to help spur the development of low-carbon economies in developing countries. That needs resources; and a flow of finance from trading is one of the potential ways that those financial resources will be achieved. There is therefore a role for trading, and the appropriate extent to which the UK relies on the buy-in of credits is therefore a subject that requires detailed attention.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="080311102000147"></a>It is also an issue which becomes more complex the more one thinks about it. For example, there are several different categories of buy-in of credits to which it would be possible to have a different attitude. Under the EU ETS, there are buy-ins of credits entirely between private players within Europe. We cannot set that as a policy variable because it is the product of a set of private decisions. One could argue&#151;although I am not necessarily doing so&#151;that we should be more relaxed about that sort of buy-in because it is entirely within Europe and is therefore part of an overall developed economy which is achieving reductions somewhere and which is therefore driving the technologies that we need.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="080311102000148"></a>There is also the possibility of purchases of clean development mechanism emission credits on a direct Government-to-Government basis. However, those are not &#147;get out of jail free&#148; cards because they have a  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1413"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cost attached to them. Given that they would cost the Treasury real money, we have to believe that there would be some Government unwillingness to sanction a large number of them.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="080311102000149"></a>Finally, there is the complexity that the EU ETS will probably allow some purchase of credits from outside the European Union in phase 3. This suggests that one of the most important things we have to influence is not necessarily our own targets for buy-in from outside, but the buy-in rules which exist from the EU ETS.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="080311102000150"></a>All of that indicates that this is an appropriate issue to be handed to the Committee on Climate Change for detailed consideration and the provision of a robustly independent recommendation on the issue. However, I realise that my own confidence in the robust independence of the committee is based on insider information and that other noble Lords cannot, by nature, be so confident. I also recognise that even if the committee recommends a certain approach, government could choose not to accept that recommendation. I therefore recognise that noble Lords may wish to ensure that there is something in the Bill which makes sure that the level of domestic effort is significant.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="080311102000151"></a>However, I am concerned that, as written, the specific form of the amendment is not the best. It could have some unintended consequences, because it does not set a minimum level of UK domestic effort&#151;it sets a minimum percentage. That could mean the following. Imagine two recommendations that the climate change committee might choose to make. In one, we recommend that there should be a 19 per cent domestic cut in emissions and in addition a 7 per cent buy-in of credits from the rest of the world. In another, we recommend a 20 per cent cut in domestic emissions and a 10 per cent buy-in from the rest of the world, for an overall reduction of 30 per cent. Under the rules of the Bill if amended by Amendment No. 106, the first, 19 per cent plus 7 per cent, would be legal. It meets the 26 per cent total amount and the 70 per cent constraint. The second recommendation, 30 per cent&#151;that is, 20 plus 10 per cent&#151;would be illegal, because although it meets the 20 per cent minimum constraint, it does not meet the 70 per cent minimum from domestic effort. But anybody who is concerned about the success of the Bill for the climate would have to prefer, in percentage terms, 20 plus 10 as a reduction to 19 plus 7. The problem has arisen from writing the amendment by reference to Clause 4(1) rather than to Clause 5(1). If it defined an absolute minimum reduction in the domestic amount, rather than a percentage of the total reduction, it would be more effective.</p>

It would be odd if we were constrained from advocating that upper figure by the Bill. My concern is that the amendment could constrain the amount of credit buy-in, when the real objective of its proposers is to set a minimum domestic reduction target. I am quite happy with the Government&#146;s proposal that this matter is handed to the Committee on Climate Change, which I am confident will make a well argued and robustly independent proposal. If noble Lords wish to proceed with the amendment, it should be expressed in terms of a minimum domestic reduction rather than a minimum percentage of the total reduction.</p>

The amendment proposes that the climate change committee has a duty to advise the Secretary of State on whether the level of the cap is sufficient.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="080311102000319"></a>&#147;We are committed to the international principle of supplementarity, which states that the use of international mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action.

It should set us on the trajectory that Sir Nicholas Stern talked about&#151;fast to a low carbon economy. I believe that that low carbon economy will also deliver all sorts of energy security gains, which I am not going to go into now. Those energy security gains, driving us to a point where we are importing far less of our fuel, is something that we should all be aiming at towards 2050.</p>

I think that I, along with many Members of the House, get slightly lost. Indeed, I tried in Committee to express it all numerically, and I think I did a good job of losing myself. The fact is that we understand the extremely important principles behind the amendment. Although there is a small argument as to what exactly the percentage should be, as laid out by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, I believe that there is a chance to amend that by the Government bringing forward an amendment at Third Reading to deal with which part of the Bill it should be in. We feel very strongly about the principle, and I believe that the amendment should be supported from all sides of the House.</p>

First, I consider that if we have a global target, as in Kyoto, we start with the assumption that one tonne of carbon emitted here or elsewhere has the same price. For various reasons, with which I agree, the noble Lords want to fix a different price so that a tonne of carbon not emitted here can be a tonne of carbon not emitted there. From what the noble Lord, Lord Turner, has told us, given what the EEC arrangements are, there is a further consideration&#151;that price within the EEC may be different from the price outside the EEC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="080311102000159"></a>This takes me back to the glorious days of multiple exchange rates that we used to have in developing countries, which were I am afraid not a very good way of allocating resources. My mind is open on this. All I want to say is that the best way to set multiple shadow prices is not in a Bill. Secondly, even if you set them, they will have to be flexible, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said. We have to find a mechanism whereby we have a wording that allows us to achieve what the noble Lords want to achieve, which I quite agree with&#151;that we have to change our behaviour, but at the same time not put in such a rigid framework that it will lead to misallocation, rather than a correct allocation, of resources.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, argued that the UK should aim to be good rather than simply appear to be good. That brought a resonance to my mind of the sale of indulgences 500 years ago by which the rich could escape the wrath to come&#151;not do their duty&#151;by using the purse. If we are going to have a moral influence in the world, we must be seen working hard to reduce our own emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="080311102000161"></a>Moreover, I am very much persuaded by the arguments of the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell, Lord Turner and Lord Desai, of the dangers of trying to state a figure in this Bill without a research base for it. However, it goes too far to leave it entirely to the committee. It needs a framework within which to develop its thinking. The Government need to give a clear steer on how they see us having a duty to reduce our emissions rather than indulgences.</p>

It is difficult to find moments when one can give a maiden speech. My noble friend Lady Afshar and I found such a moment about three weeks ago with a debate on inequality, on an interesting Motion tabled by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, but it was promptly bumped by the Northern Rock legislation and we were part of the collateral damage.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="080311102000163"></a>I see the role of all the arrangements we are discussing as a crucial part of a global deal. We have to ask about our relationships with other countries and how we will promote a decent global deal as a result of our own actions. In that context, I fully respect the motivation for this amendment. We have to show that strong low-carbon growth is possible. Without that demonstration, we and other rich countries will not bring India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and other countries with us, and you can understand why we would not. I have been very involved in policy discussions in a number of countries, particularly in India, and my friends in India tell me, &#147;Look, Nick, just as soon as that carbon capture and storage for coal plant is working on a commercial scale in the UK, you&#146;ve got my cell phone number&#151;give me a call. I&#146;ll come over and have a look and we can discuss its role in India&#148;. We have to demonstrate, clearly and here, what is possible.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="080311102000164"></a>We also have to recognise that there are very powerful arguments on trading&#151;not only on lowering cost, although that is important, but on creating a flow of carbon finance and greenhouse gas finance that can help other countries in making their own roads towards a low-carbon economy, and I think here particularly of India, Indonesia, Brazil, China and so on. It is not simply a cost-cutting mechanism; it is also a crucial element&#151;a crucial bit of the glue, if you will&#151;in a global deal. Carbon trading has a very powerful role not only through cost but in that much broader and deeper context of putting a global deal together. As we think about trading, the verification and regulation side of carbon markets is&#151;just as in financial markets more generally&#151;crucial. We have to think hard about how to improve that.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="080311102000165"></a>My concern is that the amendment as expressed is, for the reasons which my noble friend Lord Turner described, likely to constrain ambition, when ambition is of the essence here. As he argued, it could result in the setting of overall targets that are too low. In the context of a global deal and the negotiations towards the end of a global deal, it could constrain us in upping the kind of percentage reduction we are looking for because we would understand that a particular reduction domestically would be just too difficult for to us make over the next five or 10 years. So we might not be able to go, say, to 40 per cent reductions by 2020 in the negotiation, aware of the constraint that this percentage would put on us and the amount we could actually do ourselves. It could&#151;not necessarily would&#151;constrain us in our ambition and in putting together what is crucial, the big prize: the global deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="080311102000166"></a>This issue requires careful technical analysis of the kind that, as I understand it, the climate change committee has been established to do. I recommend

I do so in the confidence that the climate change committee under my noble friend Lord Turner will give clear and strong answers on the role of trading. I trust that the committee will give those answers in the context of making 2020 recommendations that are consistent with a minimum of 80 per cent reductions by 2050. I hope that the House can follow the advice of my noble friend Lord Turner, but do it in the context of looking for strong ambition&#151;80 per cent reductions by 2050&#151;and in the context of enabling what is fundamental: a good, strong, equitable global deal.</p>

Its findings on this important issue affect many in this House and around the country and may be one of the reasons that the Bill is before your Lordships&#146; House. However, I suggest to him that the amendment does not constitute a restriction on trading. It would not affect trading one way or the other. Trading could still take place. The amendment looks at ways of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="080311102000168"></a>I am speaking to this amendment because I was lobbied from a most unusual source, the CEO of a large energy company in this country, who said that it is vital if we are to tackle climate change. He is behind the amendment because this matter constitutes a circular argument. If we are not prepared to invest in very expensive kit to reduce the carbon dioxide emitted from our power stations, and to have a let-out clause to enable us to buy in from other countries, we will never tackle this matter. If we never do that, with our technical expertise, it is absolutely certain that no other country will do it. We have to take the lead on this, but if we do not we should be able to offset by buying credits from overseas. The necessary money will simply not be spent on this issue. I take noble Lords back to the whole argument about carbon storage and capture which many of us fought for over a long period. We are talking about the Government putting money into one pilot project. We could have had a pilot project up and running if the money had been available. What we are actually saying here is, &#147;It&#146;s too expensive for us to do it in this country. Therefore, we shall just wait until it becomes cheaper or we&#146;ll buy the relevant carbon dioxide from somewhere else&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="080311102000169"></a>Perhaps I am the only trading-scheme sceptic in the House this evening. However, if we are looking at financial models, it is always interesting to read the small print which states, &#147;Past performance may not be a good indicator of future performance&#148;. I hope that is the case with trading because, if you look at the European trading scheme up until this point, you would not hold it as a great model for reducing carbon dioxide. I have the same concern as regards percentages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="080311102000170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turner, mentioned being constrained about buying credits from overseas. I have a real issue with that. The amendment does not talk about trading schemes at all. It talks about reducing

Carbon sinks are a particularly worrying matter if you listen to the National Trust&#146;s view of what will happen to our peat carbon sinks over the next 20 years, which may become emitters as they dry out. If we are buying carbon credits, we should be very wary of them. The Government have already had their fingers burnt over offsets and have had to introduce measures on that. A tonne of carbon dioxide in this country and a tonne of carbon dioxide in any other country in the world is the same. However, I am concerned that buying a tonne of carbon dioxide in another country may be used as a financial tool and that that does not really equate to the reduction of a tonne of carbon dioxide.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="080311102000171"></a>On that basis, I very much hope that noble Lords will look at the terms of the amendment. I agree that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and the carbon committee can deal with this issue but we should not fall into the traps we have fallen into before. If we are to deal with climate change, as everybody in this House is concerned to do, we should be talking about genuine reductions. Fossil fuels that have been underground for millions of years should not be released into the atmosphere. We should not introduce financial mechanisms that make us feel good about this. Therefore, I very much hope that the Minister will confirm that this measure will not affect trading and could have a real effect on our ability to reduce our own emissions, which we have a moral obligation to do.</p>

I declare an interest as the administrator of the UK part of the European emissions trading system and, I hope, the future administrator of the carbon reduction commitment, should your Lordships deign to pass it. It seems clear that the mood of the House is that there needs to be something more powerful in the Bill than currently, in terms of the domestic commitment to decarbonise the UK economy. I do not want to wax lyrical, as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, did, about our global obligations and moral commitment; I want to be fairly practical, domestic and dirty about this.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="080311102000173"></a>I have two points. First, let us clarify whether it gets in the way of trading if you have a bigger proportion of the carbon reduction coming from the UK economy. The reality is that it does not. At the moment, as an economy we are still grossly inefficient in energy use, hardly off the starting blocks on renewable energy and well behind in the development of a domestic set of industries in the new, decarbonised global economy, and eventually that will turn around and bite us.</p>

<a name="80311-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="080311102000174"></a>The reality is that there is bags of scope here in the UK for our energy to be decarbonised and for there to be in fact very little need to resort to the mechanism of the trading system, which is really a mechanism put in place to allow people to choose to buy credits for emissions rather than reducing their own emissions. What we want is people buckling down and tackling the job of reducing their own emissions, not simply because it will be important for

In the interests of our domestic industry in opening up innovative products and creating new global markets that we are there in front of, not straggling along behind, it is pretty important that we get the initiative to decarbonise the UK economy moving far faster than it has done so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="080311102000175"></a>This does not get in the way of trading. It will help our global position. I recognise the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, that we do not get the balance wrong in the opposite direction. At the moment, if we are not careful, the balance will very much be to help our international partners in the developing world to reduce their carbon. We need to make sure that we do not get the balance wrong in the opposite direction, fail in our obligations and do not provide the glue that the noble Lord, Lord Stern, indicated was necessary to keep the global deal going. </p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="080311102000176"></a>That, for me, says one thing: the Bill is not sufficiently strong because the default position will be for trading rather than for domestic reduction. Although I would not want to see a number placed in the Bill for the proportion of reductions coming from UK action, I very much want to see a real commitment in the Bill for a fast movement towards the decarbonising of the UK economy. Before the next stage of the Bill, we ought to urge the Minister to explore how that can be worded in a way that does not take away from the very real need for the Committee on Climate Change to give specific advice on this. We certainly need to strengthen the Bill in this way.</p>

As well as reading his report, I commend to noble Lords his Ely lecture to the American Economic Association. The middle third is pretty difficult for people without a PhD in economics, but the first and final thirds make excellent reading. It also explains very clearly why the amendment passed in this House to set a 2 degree limit is flawed. We will come to that on another occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="080311102000178"></a>On Second Reading I expressed concern about the use of credits. There are two possible reasons for this. Was I endorsing the moral view, expressed by the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Puttnam, that we should set a minimum effort that had to be achieved domestically? Or was I taking the view that the theory of a tonne of carbon being a tonne of carbon is basically sound, but its implementation is flawed? I was expressing the second view. If it really were the case that, for significantly less than it would cost in the UK, we could achieve a global impact by the use of credits, I do not see why we should prevent ourselves doing so. Incidentally, I do not believe that this is a real problem. If we are going to reduce our use of carbon, per unit of GDP, not by 60 but by 80 per cent or 90 per cent, there is no way that we will be able to do it simply by buying credits. In the end, the whole thing will go away. We will never get to per capita emissions of 2 or 2.5 tonnes per head simply by buying our way out.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1420"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80311-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="080311102000179"></a>There is a kind of fallacy running through some of this debate, which is that the use of credits is a &#147;get out of jail&#148; card, a costless, rather immoral, way of sliding out of our obligations. These things cost money. Enterprises that buy them will find themselves at a strategic disadvantage. An enterprise that is heavily dependent on the purchase of credits will be under tremendous pressure to reduce its use of credits over time. It can use this only as a temporary measure. The use of credits has just as much impact and is just as much of an incentive to improve energy efficiency as not using them and doing it oneself. It is a powerful mechanism in its own right.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="080311102000180"></a>There are two approaches. One is to set a minimum amount for domestic effort; the other is to allow credits to be used freely. If we do that, there is the whole question of validation, which has not yet come up. We have to make sure that the credits being purchased are genuine in two senses. First, they must reduce CO2. Secondly, they must be genuinely additional. Suppose we set up a scheme that incentivises loggers to reduce logging and an area is designated. This will be useless if they simply go outside that area and continue logging.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="080311102000181"></a>I believe that the better course is not to have a limit of this kind. There is no evidence that 70 is the right figure, or that 60 or 80 are right. We have no idea. To set a figure at this stage would be a serious mistake. This is clearly what the climate change committee is being established to deal with. At the same time, we need to make a much greater effort to ensure that the quality of the credits being traded represent a genuine reduction in CO2 emissions. Again, that is an area where we could look to the Committee on Climate Change for advice.</p>

Noble Lords who have taken part have been enormously knowledgeable and erudite on the subject. I am neither, but one thing has haunted me the whole way through, and I hope the Minister will say that I am completely wrong. We have been concerned about controlling CO2 emissions per head and carbon reduction, but carbon credit trading and checking on emissions credits will mean a huge increase in cost and bureaucracy. I do not see how you can trade in carbon credits without setting up something like the Stock Exchange in a minor way to deal with the trading. Someone has to pay for buying these things and the structure for that to be done has to be put in place&#151;at expense. Firms will have to check all their carbon emissions and then work out whether they should buy or sell and what they should put on the forms that will be sent to them.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="080311102000185"></a>We discussed these issues in Committee and I gave a commitment to go away and have the matter studied further. I did that and I bring back the collective view of the Government. I repeat: it is not the view of Defra but the collective view of the Government. Having considered the matter in substantial detail over the past couple of weeks, our view remains that setting limits in national legislation on the purchase of credits would be wrong because it would send the wrong signal regarding our confidence in the market and would be damaging domestically in relation to flexibility and our ability to engage in international and EU debates on the shape of the future carbon market. As such, we cannot accept any of the amendments, and I shall set out our four main reasons for that. I shall attempt to respond to the detail of some of the points that have been made but, first, I want to put the more formal position on record.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="080311102000186"></a>The first reason is that we are already committed, through action at both a domestic and a European level, to decarbonise the UK economy. We do not need limits on the use of overseas credits to achieve this.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="080311102000187"></a>Secondly, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Bill represents the United Kingdom&#146;s contribution to what must ultimately be a global response to climate change. I emphasise that international emissions trading under binding caps plays a vital role within that, and this is also in line with the conclusions of the valuable work carried out by the noble Lord, Lord Stern.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="080311102000188"></a>We are already seeing significant flows in low-carbon investment to developing countries through the clean development mechanism, which is estimated to be worth $17.5 billion dollars at present. However, these flows will need to be massively scaled up if the world is to tackle climate change. The UN Climate Change Secretariat recently estimated that $200 billion to $210 billion of investment and financial flows would be needed in 2030 as part of a global effort to return greenhouse gas emissions to current levels. To achieve this, the UN believe that the global carbon market, driven by demand for overseas credits and deeper commitments by rich countries would have to be &#147;significantly expanded&#148; and could provide up to $100 billion of the flows needed. Therefore, we need to massively scale up&#151;not scale down&#151;the current international flows in low-carbon investment. </p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="080311102000189"></a>As we know, emissions trading also reduces costs, making it possible to reduce emissions by a greater amount. Early modelling by the Office of Climate Change suggests that the global costs of mitigation can be reduced by 50 per cent to 70 per cent in 2020 by expanding international trading in emissions permits. As I mentioned in Committee, our own analysis, and that of the European Commission, arrives at the same conclusion: emissions trading reduces costs. In other words, for the same costs, international trading allows you to reduce emissions by more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="080311102000190"></a>Thirdly, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the cornerstone of the European Union&#146;s efforts to tackle climate change and covers around 50 per cent of the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide emissions. Under EU law, United Kingdom companies can freely trade in EU allowances across national boundaries. For the purposes of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, it does not matter whether United Kingdom companies reduce their own emissions or buy allowances from another EU country where the same emissions reductions might be made more cheaply. We must not do anything in this Bill that would interfere with the legal right of UK companies to trade freely in EU allowances.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="080311102000191"></a>Fourthly, we are already bound by limits on overseas credits under the Kyoto Protocol and, since the Bill was first tabled, the European Commission has come forward with a comprehensive package of proposals on climate and energy. While these are still subject to negotiation, the Commission has proposed binding European Union-level limits on the use of project credits from uncapped schemes outside the European Union. So we do not need further limits to apply at a domestic level.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="080311102000192"></a>Looking in detail at the amendments in this group, we are unable to accept any of them, although they have been carefully considered across government. We need to think carefully about the signal that we are sending out internationally to the countries that we need to persuade to join us if we are to have an effective post-2012 international framework to tackle climate change. This Bill is partly about demonstrating to the rest of the world that we in the UK are serious both about reducing emissions domestically and about supporting action to reduce international emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="080311102000193"></a>The need for increased low-carbon investment will be a key part of the global negotiations on the action plan agreed at the Bali conference last year, which we hope will lead to international agreement&#151;the ultimate prize in tackling global climate change. In those negotiations, we will need to show emerging economies that finance will be available to them to pursue sustainable development. We cannot do this credibly if we have tied our hands in domestic legislation with strict limits on buying international credits. We would also need to be able to explain to UK companies how these amendments take account of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, to avoid cutting across their legitimate ability to meet their obligations by trading in EU allowances.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="080311102000194"></a>Amendments Nos. 110 and 137, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, would require a limit to be set on the use of overseas credits through secondary legislation, following advice from the Committee on Climate Change. I agree that the committee&#146;s view on this subject is vital. That is why the approach taken in the Bill ensures not only the provision of expert and independent advice from the Committee on Climate Change on the balance between domestic and international action, but maximum transparency about the Government&#146;s plans to meet budgets. It will therefore provide improved certainty for business, while at the same time ensuring that we can take the most cost-effective approach to reducing the UK carbon account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="080311102000195"></a>While the committee&#146;s view on the balance of effort will be valuable in informing government policy making, I do not believe that this should extend to advice on a limit. This is because a requirement to set a binding limit, as in Amendment No. 110, risks being seen internationally as undermining our continued commitment to maintaining low-carbon investment flows to developing countries.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="080311102000196"></a>Amendment No. 106 goes even further. It would set a legally binding limit now, in primary legislation, on our ability to use overseas credits to meet our budgets. I agree that this proposal would provide the greatest certainty about the balance between international and domestic action, but it would also be a completely inflexible option. Not only would the same problems with our international signals apply as under the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments, but the limit of 70 per cent would remain in force indefinitely regardless of any changes in the European or international context, unless of course further primary legislation was introduced to change the situation. Those are the reasons and I cannot gloss over them any further. I am in no position to say that we can get this all redrafted for Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="080311102000197"></a>In the debate, some points of substance were made that deserve a response. The noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Redesdale, said that the proposal does not get in the way of trading, particularly under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. We disagree with that. I am sticking carefully to the notes that I have from officials who have thought about the issue. Trying to explain verbally at the Dispatch Box without overhead projectors or PowerPoint presentations how these things work is incredibly difficult. The other morning&#151;I think that it was yesterday&#151;I heard on the &#147;Today&#148; programme two professional communicators explaining these issues. I got a bit lost&#151;and I thought that I knew a little about what was being talked about&#151;so I am sticking to the brief on this. The issue is very complicated, but the points that have been made are valuable and deserve a response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="080311102000198"></a>We cannot predict the extent to which companies will reduce their emissions in the UK and the extent to which they will buy in allowances from abroad. This will depend on the level of the carbon price and on many individual private commercial decisions, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Turner, indicated. If we were to limit the number of units bought by companies within the emissions trading system that we can count towards the net UK carbon account, we risk the problem that in some years UK companies will decide to buy more than this limit. We cannot and would not want to interfere with their freedom to do so under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme rules. However, this would mean that we could not count all these units towards meeting the overall UK budget. To comply with that overall UK budget, the Government would need to find additional emissions reductions, which could have perverse consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="080311102000199"></a>Either we would have to introduce additional regulation on top of the emissions trading system to reduce our emissions&#151;in which case, why bother having the EU Emissions Trading Scheme at all?&#151;or we could ask the rest of the economy to make up the

Neither Europe nor the Government are saying that they rely entirely on emissions trading systems, whether they are from the EU or the CRC. The European Union itself has renewable targets and it is introducing regulations on emissions from cars. There is a whole other area of EU policies, which are part of the mix; the Government, too, have such policies as part of their mix. The Minister seemed to be saying that the emissions trading schemes operate in isolation, which is how carbon targets will be met. However, the Government have a whole range of other policies&#151;unless they are telling us different now&#151;as do the EU. Of course those other policies have to be used. The Government clearly have them as active, alternative, complementary policies. I do not understand how the Government can say that they will rely only on trading systems.</p>

The practical effect would be either extra regulation or uncertainty. I am not familiar with all the points that the noble Lord raised about what is coming down the EU system, but uncertainty comes about if there is to be regulation, covering everybody, as opposed to hundreds of private sector companies making decisions at any time in a framework of their choosing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="080311102000205"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about the definition of &#147;supplemental&#148;. The UK has intentionally not defined supplementarity in numerical terms. We are in the middle of international discussions following Bali, at which we are seeking to launch the negotiations for a global and comprehensive agreement on climate change. It would be unhelpful to define supplementarity at domestic level at this point, given the risk of biasing these carefully balanced discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="080311102000206"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that, if we carry on as we are now, there is a risk of doing nothing at home. I realise that there is a degree of trust here. No one is saying that they do not believe what I or the Government are saying, but there is pressure and a demand, the implication and undertone of which is that we cannot be trusted&#151;I use that term loosely&#151;to do this. However, the Government are committed to taking significant action at home. We have shown that we can. UK emissions of greenhouse gases, even without the impact of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, were down over 15 per cent in 2005 from 1990 levels. We have reduced our non-CO2 emissions by around 44 per

The measures set out in the 2007 energy White Paper will already reduce our CO2 emissions by around 20 to 26 per cent by 2020 through domestic action and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The idea that we will not do anything at home does not stand the test of practical experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="080311102000207"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that the Government&#146;s 2010 target does not include carbon credits. This is not the case. I clearly set this out on 7 February in one of my many letters to noble Lords&#151;I apologise for the length of some of them. I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="080311102000320"></a>&#147;The Government has always made it clear that we would count carbon units purchased from overseas towards our domestic targets. This was set out in both the 2000 Climate Change Programme and its 2006 Review&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000289"></a>We made that absolutely clear. The Bill simply continues that approach. There is no change to what has been said.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="080311102000208"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Taylor, asked whether we should place an obligation on the climate change committee to recommend a limit. As other noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Stern, have said, Clause 27 already requires that. The Committee on Climate Change is required to advise on the extent to which the carbon budget should be met by domestic action and by the use of carbon units, and the Government must publish a plan setting out how we will meet the budgets. There is absolute transparency on this.</p>

<a name="80311-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="080311102000209"></a>I regret that the Government&#146;s position has not advanced since Committee, although we have advanced in as far as, in government, we have gone right over this again from scratch, not just in Defra but across all the relevant government departments. As I said, moving on this would create massive uncertainty. The fact is that we have covered the central objective, which concerns the lack of trust&#151;with a small &#147;t&#148;&#151;in the Government&#146;s position, by ensuring in Clause 27 that we will listen and take advice from the expert independent committee that is being set up under the Bill. I sincerely hope that the House agrees with that as a way forward.</p>

Have the Government considered how they might successfully regulate this entirely new and relatively untried trading concept? One can be sure that for every legitimate trader there are likely to be a dozen illegitimate ones out there waiting to take advantage of this untested situation. If the World Bank, with all its resources and all its experience, is forced to concede that as much as half its aid fails to reach the beneficiaries for whom it was intended, what chance does this fledgling scheme have of not becoming a brand-new black hole down which billions of well intended pounds, dollars, euros and yen are poured?</p>

In it, he said that overcoming climate change must be one of the great projects of this generation. I deliberately elided the concept of trust with the amendment. At the end of the Prime Minister&#146;s speech, he said that he wanted the post-2012 agreement to include,</p>

<p><a name="080311102000290"></a>I assure the Minister that 99 per cent of the population of this country listening to that remark believed that he meant domestic carbon savings. That is what I mean by trust. If he did not mean domestic savings, he could easily have said so.</p>

It would be quite wrong to come along with a whole list of regulations now to snuff out innovation and ideas, but we must bear in mind, as my noble friend said, that we must not lose billions of dollars, yen and euros down a black hole.

I am interested that we have returned so much to the area of emissions trading schemes. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, said, the amendment would not affect trading schemes, which mostly take place between national and international corporations. That would absolutely continue if the amendment were passed. The amendment would not affect trading schemes in any way; legally, it could not and would not be allowed to affect trading schemes.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="080311102000219"></a>All that the amendment would do is put a cap on the number of those schemes introduced into the accounting, not into the trading. Indeed, internationally, it would put no limit on the Government investing in foreign and developing countries&#146; emission reductions; the Government could carry on doing that. All that would happen is that, after a certain number, those reductions would not be included in the bean counting. The amendment would ensure that the Bill met its billing and the advertising that the Government and we, proudly, within the UK want it to meet in terms of UK leadership.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="080311102000220"></a>The Minister gave four reasons why the Government do not like the amendment. Funnily enough, I agree with them absolutely. I will not go through them all, but the amendment would not affect any of them. As the Minister said, there are limits on the number of CDM credits that can be included in the EU ETS. We already have those restrictions in certain areas. The Minister suggested that I was wrong about the Government&#146;s present CO2 targets, which the amendment would actually loosen. He mentioned 2005, but the government commitment was made in 1997 and it was a domestic commitment. I do not know whether the Government changed the position in 2005-06, but it was a 1997 commitment, which made no difference to trading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="080311102000221"></a>The one area on which I disagree with the Minister relates to giving faith. That is not because I do not believe in the Government&#146;s excellent intentions in this area, because I do. He mentioned figures. The United Kingdom&#146;s CO2 emissions since 1997-98 have stayed more or less the same, despite the good intentions of all of us to reduce them. I looked at the information from Defra at the end of last week. The last two bars on the graph for 2005-06 show a decrease, but the only reason for that is the inclusion of EU ETS credits. That is why we cannot just have faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="080311102000222"></a>The final matter that I will comment on is whether this should all be sent back to the Committee on Climate Change. The decision needs to be equally political and technical. I am disappointed that the Government have not moved at all since the Committee stage and, on that basis, I would like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="080311102000228"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group, which includes government amendments.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="080311102000229"></a>The amendments concern the definition of a carbon unit and the procedures for changing this definition through regulation. Amendment No. 107 seeks to ensure that the definition of a carbon unit coincides with international practice. It was brought forward to bring greater precision to what is meant by a carbon unit and to ensure that the international context was taken into account.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="080311102000230"></a>Government Amendment No. 114 seems to cover our concern by placing a duty on the Secretary of State to take into account the committee&#146;s recommendation with regard to changing the definition of carbon units. This seems to be sufficient as it is unlikely that the committee would suggest a definition which is wildly inconsistent with international practice. It is an example of a situation in which the Government have heeded the calls from this side of the House to put the committee in a more prominent role.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="080311102000231"></a>The two other amendments in the group add further circumstances which would require the affirmative procedure should these changes be made. We welcome the chance to scrutinise any changes to the amount a carbon unit will be worth, as it were, in terms of the net UK carbon account. Therefore we are grateful for the Government&#146;s concession here to allow more transparency and parliamentary accountability.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="080311102000232"></a>Considering the importance of administering the carbon accounts, will the Minister comment as to why any changes to the scheme of administration would not also be subject to the affirmative procedure? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="080311102000233"></a><b><a name="80311-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="080311102000815"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, as the noble Lord said, this group of amendments deals with the carbon accounting system established under the Bill and how to ensure it will be robust, transparent and subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny. We are all trying to achieve the same thing.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="080311102000234"></a>Amendment No. 107 would create a link between the carbon accounting system and international carbon reporting practice, but we are not sure that it is the best way to ensure that we have a robust and credible system. The concept of international carbon reporting practice is defined in Clause 75 more in terms of the protocols for measuring greenhouse gas emissions than in accounting for carbon units, credits or allowances. We think there are better ways to design the necessary safeguards, to which I shall come later.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="080311102000235"></a>The Bill already limits what could be recognised as a carbon unit. In order to be recognised it must meet one of the three criteria set out in Clause 21(1). It must represent a reduction in greenhouse gases which has taken place; the removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere; or form part of a scheme which caps the amount of permitted greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="080311102000236"></a>Amendment No. 113 would add to the list of situations in which the affirmative resolution procedure was required relating to changes in the body administering the carbon accounting system. We do not think this is justified, nor do we believe it is necessarily the most important issue when looking at the robustness of the scheme as a whole. The body appointed as the scheme administrator is only one aspect of the way in which we will manage our carbon accounts and, while it is an important issue, we do not see why it should be given greater priority.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080311102000237"></a>Instead, we feel the priority to ensure a robust carbon accounting system is to ensure that any carbon units used under the Bill are of the right standing and environmental rigour. Government Amendments Nos. 112 and 114 will ensure this by providing for independent advice and proper parliamentary scrutiny before any new types of carbon units are recognised under the Bill. I shall speak to and move these two amendments in due course.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080311102000238"></a>Clause 23 already provides that the first set of carbon accounting regulations should only be made following advice from the Committee on Climate Change and a vote in both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure. The two amendments provide that where new types of carbon unit are recognised as being valid for compliance purposes, or where the value of existing carbon units has been changed, the same safeguards will apply. Any such changes could only be made following advice from the Committee on Climate Change and a vote in both Houses. The two government amendments are intended to provide further safeguards, on an ongoing basis, to ensure the environmental rigour of the rules on carbon accounting. They will ensure that, every time a new carbon unit is recognised as counting towards the UK&#146;s targets, and every time the value of a carbon unit is changed, the Government must seek expert independent advice from the Committee on Climate Change, and be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny in both Houses through the affirmative procedure.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1432"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80311-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="080311102000239"></a>These amendments go beyond the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee, which recommended that the first set of carbon accounting regulations should be subject to the affirmative procedure,</p>
<ul><a name="080311102000353"></a>&#147;so that the House may be assured that the basic framework for the credits and debits regime is satisfactory&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000291"></a>We have accepted this recommendation already, in Clause 23, and now propose to go even further. The question of which carbon units are used, and how much they are worth, is more important in terms of the overall robustness of the system than a change in the body administering the scheme, which is proposed in Amendment No. 113.</p>

<a name="80311-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080311102000240"></a>This touches on the concerns raised by my noble friend Lord Puttnam in our previous debate about the quality of the carbon units that we can count towards our targets. Amendments Nos. 112 and 114 would prevent any Government from seeking, in some way, to smuggle through fundamental changes to the rules on carbon accounting, without proper advice or scrutiny. I hope that the amendments provide noble Lords with confidence about the Government&#146;s commitment to the robustness of the system we are establishing under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080311102000260"></a>Amendment No. 120 provides that, before making regulations to include international aviation or international shipping emissions, the Secretary of State must seek, and take account of, advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Any such regulations would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure to ensure full scrutiny. To avoid duplication, Amendment No. 119 therefore deletes Clause 25(7) as it is now covered by Amendment No. 120. The amendments will ensure that this process is fully transparent, so that the committee&#146;s advice is made available, subject to the usual exemptions set out elsewhere in the Bill,

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080311102000267"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we had a long and constructive debate in Committee on the types of expertise that would be desirable in the composition of the committee. Having reflected on the discussions,  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1435"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1435</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I move two amendments which I hope will help to clarify the types of expertise that we believe are needed.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080311102000268"></a>Amendment No. 122 will make it clear that the committee should have expertise in climate policy at both national and international level. During our debate in Committee, I noted that while Clause 10 requires the committee to take,</p>
<ul><a name="080311102000354"></a>&#147;circumstances at European and international level&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000292"></a>into account, expertise of an international nature was not present in the list of desirable expertise for the committee as set out in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1. The amendment is intended to address this discrepancy. It is important as the UK&#146;s approach to tackling climate change must be considered in the context of wider international effort and impacts, and a range of international issues will be relevant to the committee&#146;s advice on budgets. It is therefore right that the committee has an appropriate awareness of the European and international context.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080311102000269"></a>Amendment No. 123 is intended to clarify that it would be desirable for the committee to have expertise not only in climate science but also in other branches of environmental science. Having reflected on our discussions in Committee, we are sympathetic to the arguments put forward in support of the Committee on Climate Change having some expertise in a wider range of areas than implied by the term &#147;climate science&#148;. By including &#147;other branches of environmental science&#148; we make it explicit in the Bill that national authorities must have regard to the desirability of securing that the committee as a whole has this expertise.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080311102000270"></a>Like the other areas of expertise covered in the list, &#147;environmental science&#148; is of course a broad category. This is important as it provides the flexibility for the national authorities and the chair to appoint members with specific expertise within this broad area, as the committee&#146;s work demands.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080311102000271"></a>For the record, I say once again that the list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive and that the national authorities could choose to appoint a member with expertise in an area not listed, if the national authorities and the chair thought it desirable. Furthermore, I reiterate that the Government continue to consider climate science to be the most important aspect of environmental science for the committee. However, by including &#147;environmental science&#148; on the list we are demonstrating that it will be important for the committee as a whole to have an understanding of the impacts of climate change on the natural environment. I beg to move.</p>

That is why tackling climate change is a global issue and why international agreements are the only way forward. It is vital to recognise this in the Bill, and the Government are to be congratulated on recognising that at Committee stage.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080311102000273"></a>It is of major significance that the amendment links the phrase &#147;at international level&#148; to the phrase &#147;social impact&#148;. The Bill on climate change now recognises the reality of what is happening in other parts of the world, places that are already devastated by the changes in climate for which people were not prepared.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080311102000274"></a>Last week, the Minister resisted the amendment on poverty reduction, saying&#151;and I paraphrase&#151;that this point is implicit in other parts of the Bill. He is right, and here it is, &#147;the social impacts&#148; at &#147;international level&#148;. This draws attention to issues of poverty in other parts of the world.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080311102000275"></a>Like other Members of your Lordships&#146; House, I welcome the Government&#146;s speed in announcing the six members of the Committee on Climate Change. It has been good to have the noble Lord, Lord Turner, in his place this afternoon. The Minister said that he would do this by Report, and he has. However, the final paragraph of the press release announcing the membership of the committee, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="080311102000348"></a>&#147;We are very committed to ensuring that all areas of expertise set out in the Bill are represented within the Committee&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000294"></a>The press release then lists these as,</p>
<ul><a name="080311102000356"></a>&#147;climate science and policy, economics, business competitiveness and financial management&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000295"></a>There is no mention in the press release of social impacts at international level. Will the Minister assure us that, with the passing of this amendment, this area of expertise&#151;namely, social impacts at an international level&#151;will be explicitly added to the committee?</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="080311102000276"></a>Before I sit down, perhaps I may draw attention to the new strategic framework from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which, in a section headed &#147;Promote a low carbon, high growth, global economy&#148;, says that its intention is to,</p>
<ul><a name="080311102000357"></a>&#147;increase international commitment to an open economy and achieving the Millennium Development Goals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311102000277"></a>That is in a section on the low-carbon global economy.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080311102000278"></a>We on these Benches welcome this strategic framework published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We believe that this government amendment to the Bill will indeed give the committee the opportunity to have before it this strategic framework and to advise the Government further on how the millennium development goals can be achieved as they pursue issues of the social impacts at an international level. I support the amendment.</p>

However, while what the Government have done appears to follow fairly closely what the noble Lord and my noble friend Lady Northover tried to  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1437"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>say on an earlier occasion, what we were talking about was expertise in international development, and those words do not appear in the Bill. The right reverend Prelate has also rightly welcomed the speed with which the Government have announced the names of those being appointed to the climate change committee. Some of them&#151;such as Dr Fankhauser, with his knowledge and experience on the World Bank&#151;could be said to have the requisite experience of international development.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080311102000280"></a>I so agree with what the right reverend Prelate said&#151;that we need to have regard to the official government objective of helping developing countries to realise the millennium development goals to which the international community is heavily committed&#151;although we see now, for example from the recent UNICEF report on <I>State of the World's Children</I>, that in many regions of the world those goals are unlikely to be attained within the timescales set. So although we welcome the Government's proposed additional words, we are concerned that there is not apparently a person with particular expertise on international development nominated to the committee. We hope that the words that the right reverend Prelate quoted do not exclude the appointment of additional persons in the future with that particular expertise.</p>

<p><a name="080311102000296"></a>It is an important amendment. Food production, both domestically and abroad, is an issue that has changed rapidly over the past year. Paragraph 1(3)(g) of the schedule mentions &#147;energy production and supply&#148;. I am sure that there will be conflicting interests as a result of how we address climate change, how we produce and supply energy and how we supply food, because the three are totally linked.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="080311102000283"></a>Earlier yesterday the Minister attended and spoke at a meeting of the Wildlife Link group. Environmental and wildlife protection issues need to be considered at the same time as we consider food and energy supply. I am grateful that the Government have introduced this amendment to include environmental science. Its voice should be there and it should be heard. Although the other committee members covered by paragraph 1(3)(a) to (i) will have these issues in mind, Amendment No. 123 will not go amiss because of the clear challenges we will face in coming years to round the circle of the many demands made on our planet. I welcome Amendment No. 122 and particularly Amendment No. 123, and I thank the Minister for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080311114000010"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 131, 152, 165 and 197. The Joint Committee identified at an early stage that the original draft Bill was heavily concerned with mitigation targets and devoted little attention to adaptation. That situation  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1439"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1439</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has improved to a certain extent. However, people in the environmental movement are clear that adaptation to climate change is as important as mitigation. It is a regrettable fact that many of the consequences of climate change will continue to be felt even if we ceased emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases immediately&#151;hence the urgency to introduce mitigating measures. There is a time lag of between 100 and 200 years in that regard. Therefore, adaptation is incredibly important and is the reason these amendments were tabled. They stand in my name and those of other noble Lords from other sides of the House. The United Kingdom needs to focus on adaptation through this Bill.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080311114000011"></a>I listened carefully to the debate we had on this issue in Committee and redrafted the amendments as a result. At that stage we wanted to have an ad hoc adaptation committee entirely separate from the rest of the machinery in the Bill. On reflection, we decided that our proposal was flawed and have therefore redrafted the amendment to place even greater emphasis on adaptation. Clearly, the best way to do that is to include it in one of the Bill&#146;s main structures; namely, the Committee on Climate Change. The Bill provides for sub-committees of the climate change committee but is not specific about them, nor about who should be on them or what subjects they should tackle. We think that there should be a sub-committee specifically concerned with adaptation and that it needs to be separate from the committee because the subjects that it will tackle, its goals and the assessments it will need to make require very different skills than those required to tackle mitigation. Therefore, while we adopt a holistic approach in bringing mitigation and adaptation together under the climate change committee, it is very important to have a separate sub-committee to tackle adaptation. The amendment states very clearly the skills and expertise that members of that sub-committee will require. Amendment No. 152 sets out the important roles that the sub-committee would perform.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080311114000012"></a>Amendment No. 165 states that the committee&#146;s report must assess the Government&#146;s programme for adaptation to climate change, consider its implementation and, most importantly, look at,</p>
<ul><a name="080311114000104"></a>&#147;any further action required as part of the programme&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311114000081"></a>So this is a very important and powerful committee.</p>

<a name="80311-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080311114000013"></a>Amendment No. 197 would strengthen the parliamentary response to climate change as it would require the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="080311114000105"></a>&#147;invite the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee to review every report laid before Parliament under this section&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311114000082"></a>We believe that would help ensure that the Government would be held fully accountable to Parliament for their policies and programmes on adaptation, as they are for those on mitigation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080311114000015"></a>As we have said before, it is important that in our efforts to stop climate change we do not lose sight of the things we are trying to effect. We must ensure that policies and proposals aimed at reducing carbon emissions are also sustainable and that adequate policies are put in place to adapt to the unavoidable changes in the climate that are taking place.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080311114000016"></a>We will not be able to escape the effects of some aspects of climate change but we can be prepared by continually monitoring what adaptive measures we are taking and what needs to be done. The whole goal of the Bill is to provide ways to tackle the challenges of a changing climate and to stop that change through reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080311114000017"></a>The primary aim is to stop the change by cutting down emissions but this goes hand in hand with the impact on the environment that climate change brings. Thus, recognising the immense burden placed on the Committee on Climate Change as well as the importance of programmes and measures to adapt to climate change, these amendments create a sub-committee to focus on these issues. Its duties would include assessing the risks of climate change and providing proposals to mitigate these risks. By having a sub-committee devoted to adaptation, we can be sure that these issues do not become exiled from climate change proposals.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080311114000018"></a>Another of these amendments places a duty on the Environmental Audit Committee to examine the Secretary of State's report on the impact of climate change. We believe that this added level of scrutiny would provide another useful resource on the road to determining precisely what the impacts of climate change have been and what needs to be done to address them. Essentially, the amendments strengthen the mechanisms for assessing the context of our efforts to reduce emissions. I hope that they will receive wide support in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080311114000020"></a>Despite some people&#146;s early reservations, in my judgment the success of Ofcom is in no small part due to the work of its excellent content sub-committee. Adequately resourced and ably chaired by Ofcom&#146;s deputy chair, originally Richard Hooper and now Philip Graf, the content sub-committee of Ofcom has managed to allay all those early fears that an essentially economically-focused organisation would somehow allow matters relating to programmes to become marginalised or even reduced to a kind of second-order business. With its own board structure, the availability of independent expertise and a designated section in the Ofcom annual report, an enormous amount has been achieved in establishing an atmosphere of trust among content creators across the whole of the sectors that Ofcom regulates.</p>

<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1441"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between the issues of content and adaptation are really quite remarkable. Both require a type of specialist knowledge that would need to be accommodated in a single significantly larger climate change committee, which is something that none of us wishes to see happen. To seriously address measures of adaptation in the UK, any statutory sub-committee would have to be very much actions-based, working within the broad policy parameters and addressing the consequences&#151;that is the key word&#151;whatever has been thrashed out and agreed between the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and the Government of the day. I personally have no doubt whatever that this is the right way to go forward. Frankly, the Government would be wilfully myopic not to talk to Ofcom, study its annual report and take advantage of what has become a real success story for this Government.</p>

That is detailed in the report, so I will not go over it again now. I would like to be assured by the Minister when he replies that those particular risks can be properly considered by the Committee on Climate Change and that there is a good reason, if he is going to oppose the amendment, for saying that the adaptation that is needed to respond to those risks to the overseas territories can be properly considered by the parent committee.</p>

There was a report on the news this morning saying that last summer&#146;s floods were not the result of climate change, with which I entirely agree. Nevertheless, here we are tonight facing some of the strongest storms and gales since the hurricane in 1980-odd. That sets the tone for the fact that adaptation to climate change is going to become an increasingly important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080311114000024"></a>I, too, welcome the Government&#146;s changes to strengthen the adaptation elements of the Bill. I was rather buoyed up in Committee by what I took to be the assurances of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that he saw the merits of an adaptation sub-committee, or at least a mechanism for independent scrutiny and advice. I was a bit disappointed that that assurance did not seem to manifest itself into a government amendment. I support Amendments Nos. 131 and 152, which would set up an adaptation sub-committee with very different skills from those people on the main climate change committee. It needs to be there to allow the two legs of climate change&#151;mitigation and adaptation&#151;to be properly represented at that level of expert advice. This is not a committee the function of which could be performed by parliamentary scrutiny, which is very much general scrutiny in the public interest. It is a committee similar to the climate change committee that gives expert advice and comments

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080311114000025"></a>The reason why I am hesitant in standing up is because I cannot make up my mind whether every time I talk about this we get visited by some manifestation of climate change, or the way that it might be with climate change in the future. If we do not resolve this here in your Lordships&#146; House and it has to go to the other place, by then we could be into the period when droughts and heat waves would be the manifestations, and I hesitate to wish those on the country this summer. I know that the Minister is anxious about the setting up of an adaptation sub-committee and feels that parliamentary scrutiny is sufficient. I do not believe that it is a substitute; this would be an expert committee.</p>

Having laid out the arguments to him&#151;he has been in the past a notorious sceptic about an adaptation sub-committee&#151;he seemed to get pretty frisky in favour of it.

That is particularly so because I understand that the main committee will be smaller than I think is wise, and certainly smaller than the very effective committee that I chaired in the National Rivers Authority.

The Minister for Climate Change, Phil Woolas, who has been referred to today and whose day job is in the other place, fully considered these matters. I am simply the man on earth in the Lords; that is the reality of this. This is an important point, and I will speak to the amendments as though my heart was fully in it. I thank noble Lords for another excellent debate on a very important subject.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080311114000031"></a>The Government have tabled some amendments, which we will come to later&#151;they are not in this group&#151;on reporting on adaptation, which will increase the ability of Parliament and the public to monitor progress. That is important to ensure proper scrutiny. Currently, the Climate Change Ministers and the Government are not minded to accept these amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 131, 152 and 165. I am quite happy to accept Amendment No. 197 if anybody wants to push it, but it does not alter the position at all. It is useless to put it in the Bill, but we will do it because that can be done at any time. I would quite like to do a deal and say that we will accept that one if noble Lords do not push the others, but I realise that I am in no position to say that.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080311114000032"></a>The Bill includes completely new duties and powers on adaptation, so we are doing things about adaptation. It is not as though the Government are not taking any action. These new duties and powers in the Bill show that the Government take incredibly seriously the need to adapt to climate change. These provisions have been strengthened by the amendments that we have tabled.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080311114000033"></a>The scrutiny of the risk assessment and adaptation programme is very important; we are all completely agreed on this. I want to set out why we think arrangements different from those for mitigation are justified for adaptation. I accept, of course, that there are links between adaptation policy and mitigation policy, but there are some important differences. One is about controlling pollution, the other about managing the changing risks. The people who will need to take action are often different. Mitigation policy focuses on power, heat, transport and consumers. Adaptation policy is definitely much broader and the issues vary more by location. The expertise for reducing carbon emissions and the expertise for managing new risks are different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080311114000034"></a>I fully accept that what has been said in one or more of the speeches implies different or additional people, but I am speaking about the Committee on Climate Change as set out in the name and numbers in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 131, 152 and 165 propose a new sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change, designed to focus on mitigation issues and provide expert advice to government on what reductions in emissions the UK will make. It will report annually to Parliament on progress towards the targets and budgets set under the Bill. Although I fully agree with all that my noble friend said about Ofcom, although I do not know the details, I

I would not go to the wall on that, but the parallel of that sub-committee reporting to regulator is not exactly the same.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080311114000035"></a>All noble Lords agree that these are important tasks, and it is therefore vital that the climate change committee is properly resourced and has the right skills. There are several reasons why the committee or any sub-committees are not the right bodies to deal with adaptation. First, it is wrong to assume that a body with one type of scrutiny function should naturally be given another. Secondly, the committee could become unwieldy and unfocused if its remit were significantly expanded to take on adaptation responsibilities. The amendment proposes a new sub-committee with a whole new set of members. That is the point I am making: we are talking about additional groups of people. Proposed new sub-paragraph (3)(j) in Amendment No. 131 says that the sub-committee should include expertise in &#147;any other ... adaptations required&#148;. This, of course, could cover every sector of society and the economy. It could become quite unwieldy.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080311114000036"></a>Thirdly, we have discussed on a number of occasions whether the Committee on Climate Change should have a role in policy. The Government have argued strongly that it should not, as this would damage its impartiality and credibility as a technical-expertise independent body in its role of advising on targets and tracking progress against those targets. I quote from one of our debates on 8 January:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="080311114000095"></a>&#147;I will have a great concern if the Committee on Climate Change starts making major policy recommendations to government ... it would not depoliticise the decisions but would utterly politicise the Committee on Climate Change. It would be like many other bodies&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311114000083"></a>which,</p>
<ul><a name="080311114000096"></a>&#147;make all kinds of recommendations and are therefore seen as part of the political scenery and not as part of the scientific scenery&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/1/08; col. 802.]</ul>
<a name="80311-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080311114000037"></a>When I first read that in my brief I remember thinking that I had not said it, and I had not; it was the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. I remember responding, because I put it the other way around. We did not want it to be politicised. We are now discussing amendments which would require the Committee on Climate Change to assess the adequacy of government programmes and the contribution of government policies. There is a contradiction here and I have no doubt that the noble Lord will explain that in due course. He could, of course, explain it by withdrawing the amendment. Our view is that, whatever happens, we must not undermine the credibility of the Committee on Climate Change as a body focused on the science. We emphasise that. It is focused on the science, rather than on any of the political aspects.</p>

<a name="80311-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080311114000038"></a>Finally, I note in passing that noble Lords opposite have also tabled Amendment No. 134, which seems implicitly to criticise the value of sub-committees. We are not sure how that amendment fits with the amendments we are discussing here, which would set up a whole new sub-committee. We will come to that in due course. Mainstreaming adaptation into normal business will be critical to successful adaptation.

It is a big, big programme. I do not seek to undervalue that in any way. The most effective scrutiny of whether each sector is adapting to climate change would be a matter for the relevant parliamentary Select Committees. This issue will dominate work in Parliament in the years ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080311114000039"></a>As I have said, I would be quite happy to accept Amendment No. 197. The audit committee already has the right to scrutinise the national risk assessment, so the amendment merely reflects the current position, but we are quite happy to put it in the Bill. It is true that I have not come back with anything. We have thought about it and it has been discussed in government. The fact that I have not come back with anything is not to say that we have not had quite vigorous discussions in government. I hope the totality of government amendments tabled on Report, following Committee, shows that we have genuinely discussed these issues. Where we have been able to move collectively, we have done so. There are some issues, however, where the position set out in the Bill is one we wish to maintain in this House. It will then, of course, be subject to scrutiny in the other place.</p>

The committee can go much wider than what is in the Bill. I make it abundantly clear that if the committee chooses to look at climate change issues and at the science with a view to giving advice, there will be no no-go areas. In a way, that is one of our criticisms, because on the one hand we have to give an idea in the Bill of the nature of the committee&#146;s work, but on the other we do not want to prescribe its functions and curtail it because changes will occur. Other information, other reports, science from around the world and the effect of climate change on other parts of the world are bound to be taken into account by the committee, and it does not need the permission of government or, indeed, the permission of the Bill to do so. The Bill does not curtail the committee; it gives a list in a subsection

I think that my point is relevant and I hope that my intervention will be acceptable to the House. Following what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said, did the Government consider the amendment in the light of the information being reported to the new Committee on Climate Change rather than, as the Minister implied, it being reported to the House? They are two totally different issues. That was simply the point on which I sought clarification.</p>

The example that my noble friend gave was a good one, although I am not familiar with the inner workings. It is wholly right that a committee which is to represent viewers&#146; rights and maintain broadcasting integrity should advise a communications regulator, but it does not follow that a sub-committee scrutinising a government programme should advise a committee established to set carbon budgets. My point was that there is a parallel to be drawn because of the success of what has happened in Ofcom, but it is not necessarily exactly a dead square fit with what we are debating here.</p>

They attempt to ensure that important decisions remain in the hands of the committee members. We want the Committee on Climate Change to have the power to create sub-committees to investigate areas that it deems appropriate. Notwithstanding the vote on the last issue, however, we do not want the sub-committees to be making decisions on the most vital and high-profile issues listed in Part 1, such as the 2050 target, the carbon budgets or the determination of whether the Government are meeting their objectives. I do not expect the committee to shy away from those responsibilities nor do I want to give the impression that we on this side of the House want to manage, in a pejorative sense, the committee.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="080311114000088"></a>It seems that the Minister agrees with us about the importance of the committee taking the mantle of the decisions.

I draw that to his attention, as it saves having to wing letters around Whitehall.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080311114000060"></a>These amendments would restrict the ability of the Committee on Climate Change to delegate any function, no matter how minor, to a sub-committee, employee or individual member. While we understand that there is concern, which we discussed in Committee, that any advice or reports made by the committee should come with its full authority and not be delegated, we do not consider the amendment to be appropriate or proportionate. In practice&#151;I am sure that this is not what is intended&#151;the amendment would mean that, for example, the chief executive could not take a decision about appointing a junior member of staff to the secretariat or the secretariat could not decide to commission research from a particular organisation. All decisions, including those relating to perhaps relatively insignificant operational tasks, would need to be taken by the committee as a whole. That does not seem sensible and I cannot believe that that was what was intended, as it would hinder the running of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="080311114000061"></a>As I said in Committee, we consider it very unlikely that the committee would ever delegate in full one of its core functions. The committee&#146;s members will be, and indeed are, distinguished and respected experts in their areas, some of whom have considerable experience of working in similar bodies. I do not believe that any of them would wish to risk their credibility by allowing a sub-committee to offer advice to the Government or to report to Parliament on the committee&#146;s behalf without having played a significant role in the development of that advice. While the committee may well choose to establish a sub-committee to look at specific issues and ask secretariat members to write sections of its reports, we are confident that it will take responsibility for the discharge of its functions under the Bill, as the committee members themselves will ultimately have to take responsibility for the quality of its output.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080311114000062"></a>Since Committee stage, we have looked again at the wording of paragraph 19 of Schedule 1, as I agreed to do, to see whether there is a need to clarify that all

However, we do not believe that there is a case for amending it or for accepting the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. The ability to delegate some functions to a sub-committee, an individual member or an employee is a perfectly standard provision for non-departmental public bodies, so we do not consider that it poses any risk to the robustness of the authority or the credibility of the committee&#146;s advice. I hope that that explanation satisfies noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080311114000067"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments concerns public participation and the functions of the Committee on Climate Change. I shall speak to the group as a whole before addressing individual amendments. The idea of including the public was well received on all sides in Committee. It was understood that the intention was not to water down the scientific objectivity of the committee but simply to recognise that these decisions are not made in a vacuum. The benefits of great public confidence in the committee and its decisions could be the difference between meeting the targets and not meeting them, given that the public have a very large role to play in mitigating climate change.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080311114000068"></a>I was pleased to hear in Committee that the Minister was willing to consider including a mechanism to ensure public participation. However, I was slightly disappointed when I saw what had been brought forward, which seems to me to be perhaps the weakest duty that can be written into law. There is no duty at all to engage with the public in the government amendment. There is merely a duty to think about whether public participation is a good idea. The government amendment states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="080311114000103"></a>&#147;The Committee must have regard to the desirability of involving the public in the exercise of its functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311114000089"></a>That is almost like having no duty at all. Under this construction, the committee could conclude that it was a good idea to have public participation and even think that it was very important, but then, having satisfied the legal requirements, do nothing at all.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="080311114000069"></a>That amendment places a duty to discover whether or not it is a good idea to involve the public. Our amendments begin with that idea as their foundation. Why are the Government being so timid? We say that it is desirable to have some element of public participation. We are not trying to dictate what form this should take; that is up to the committee. However, we simply feel that the government amendment is far too weak. The goal was perhaps to say something like, &#147;The committee must have regard to the fact that public involvement is desirable&#148;, but that is manifestly not what is in the amendment. The text places a duty to &#147;have regard to&#148; the idea of &#147;desirability&#148;&#151;or at least it could very easily be interpreted as such. This is entirely insufficient. Even if the amendment were phrased as I have just suggested, it would not amount to much of a duty. Simply taking note that public participation is something that people might want is not enough.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080311114000070"></a>If this House feels that there is a need for some form of public involvement, I hope that it recognises that the government amendment does not provide that. Our wording is stronger. It would place a duty on public participation without binding the hands of the committee. It would simply place a duty on the committee to take all reasonable steps to ensure effective public participation. Does the Minister think that this is too inclusive? Is his aim to provide a way for the committee to avoid public engagement? Does he feel that taking steps to ensure that there is effective public participation would be too burdensome? What is the reason for the weakness of the government amendment? It seems to me that the wording of the government amendment effectively means that there will be no public participation in practice, whereas under our construction public participation would be guaranteed. There is a world of difference. I beg to move.</p>

I thought, as he has expressed so eloquently, that the duty in government Amendment No. 178 was quite weak. I am particularly concerned about this issue because we are talking about the importance of the decision-making of the Committee on Climate Change. That committee will have incredible powers and its recommendations will have real influence on the business, commercial and domestic communities. Each area will find that different recommendations of the committee will have financial and ethical implications on how it conducts its duty.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080311114000072"></a>I do not know about the legal definition in Amendment No. 135, but &#147;effective public participation&#148; worries me, as a whole industry could be built up around lobbying the committee. Each of us receives vast amounts of unsolicited mail and, indeed, a large amount of targeted mail. That will also be the case for the Committee on Climate Change. In talking about &#147;effective public participation&#148;, we may also be giving the lobbyists interesting access, although they, too, will have an important role to play. Although the government amendment seems too weak, it is the one that I prefer and it will probably be carried. My problem with it is that, if the committee takes a strong view and rejects public opinion, it will alienate sections of the public who feel strongly about certain other issues.</p>

That could be perceived outside. We are not going to give lobbyists or NGOs ownership of the Committee on Climate Change. Nobody in their right mind would want to do that. However, the committee must be open and transparent and it must have a reaction or interaction and dialogue with the public in the same way as all other non-departmental public bodies have. That is just good practice and what normally happens. It is not as if we have never put together a non-departmental public body. This is not just some committee&#151;the term &#147;committee&#148; sends the wrong signal&#151;it is a non-departmental public body that will operate in the same way as others.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080311114000074"></a>I realise that in our previous debate a recurring theme was the importance of the relationships between the Committee on Climate Change, the Government, Parliament and the public. We emphasised the importance of ensuring democratic accountability within the framework of setting carbon budgets. I said that for the public to hold the Government to account the carbon budgeting framework must be transparent and accessible.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080311114000075"></a>Government Amendment No. 178 is intended to ensure that where appropriate the committee will take steps to offer the public opportunities to engage in and understand its work. It will be for the committee, as an independent body, to decide how best to do this. It does not matter whether it is a roadshow, open meetings or modern technology; it is up to the committee to decide. The committee has already been taking steps to ensure appropriate public engagement. In November last year, the shadow secretariat to the committee issued a call for evidence, explaining its proposed work programme and inviting feedback and further evidence. This month, it will be holding a series of introductory workshops where it will set out its role to stakeholders and explain its proposed approach to the 2050 review and the carbon budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="080311114000076"></a>By tabling our amendment, we are seeking to ensure that the committee has regard to the desirability of engaging with others and to encourage it, where appropriate, to take steps to do so. It just has to be mindful of the benefits of engaging the public in its work. Our amendment is an effective part of our package of amendments to maximise openness and transparency in the climate change committee&#146;s work within the wider legislative framework. In turn, this will increase the credibility and acceptability to the public of the committee&#146;s advice. Given the potential impact on the general public of climate change and actions to mitigate it, it is right that the committee should be asked to consider how the public might be appropriately involved in its work. Our amendment results from the same intentions as Amendment No. 135 tabled by the noble Lord. Both are intended to ensure that the committee takes steps to engage with the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="080311114000077"></a>Amendment No. 138 would introduce a new clause that would give the committee a duty to make timely recommendations to the Secretary of State in relation  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1454"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to Part 1 of the Bill, and require it to consult the public on what recommendations should be made. It seems to repeat a lot of the issues that we have already discussed, so we are unclear about where it would add value. The Government have tabled amendments on public engagement and transparency, which that amendment also covers. Subsection (1) in the new clause introduced by Amendment No. 138 would place a new duty on the Committee on Climate Change to make timely recommendations. However, Clause 30 already places a duty on the committee to provide advice, analysis, information or other assistance when requested by a national authority in connection with the authority&#146;s functions under the Act or climate change generally. We cannot see how that amendment would enhance the provisions already in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80311-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080311114000078"></a>I plead with the House to give the committee a fair wind. We should set it up as an independent non-departmental public body, with all its duties, following the good practice of other non-departmental public bodies. We do not get a lot of complaints about them not wanting to interact with the public; they do it on a regular basis.</p>

We have been debating these issues for a number of weeks now. I hope that the Minister knows my attitude to the Bill; I think that I understand his. However, I hope that he agrees that government Amendment No. 178 can be read in a rather negative way. Our amendments were specifically designed to address the issue, which has come up before, of the need to have public opinion and engagement to make a success of the Bill and the mission to affect climate change through carbon emissions. I hope that the Minister&#146;s words reinforce his view, and will reinforce the view of the climate change committee, that it is desirable to engage with the public.

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080311116000006"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have kept my powder dry throughout the proceedings this evening so that I can concentrate on this amendment.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080311116000007"></a>My noble friend referred to &#147;giving a fair wind&#148; to this non-departmental public body. That is what lies behind my amendments. I want to shift the emphasis of work from advice to Ministers to decision-taking. I regard the thrust of my amendments as being at the very heart of the Bill. I have a clear difference of opinion with the Government as to how that committee should operate and what its powers should be.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080311116000008"></a>My noble friend will recall that I set out my preliminary views on 14 January&#151;<I>Hansard</I><I>,</I> cols. 1064-66&#151;of how the committee would function, on the back of someone else&#146;s amendment. I do not want to repeat my arguments from that occasion. However, Amendment No. 175, one of the amendments I shall concentrate on this evening, sets out the need for the Government to agree reports with the committee. Apart from Amendment No. 176, my amendments are consequential.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080311116000009"></a>In Committee, I set out to show that there was a precedent for the concept of agreeing reports between departments and NGOs&#151;in that case the National Audit Office&#146;s Comptroller and Auditor-General and departmental officials on value-for-money reports from the NAO, and on appropriation account reports from the NAO. I quoted from a Joint Committee of the DES and the NAO, which the NAO had provided to the PAC on 23 April 1986, which dealt with the arrangements for agreeing reports. The minutes stated that, in agreeing reports, the Comptroller and Auditor-General&#146;s intention was to establish, first, that all material and relevant facts have been included; secondly, that the facts were not in dispute; thirdly, that the presentation of the facts was fair; and, fourthly, where the report stated any NAO view or conclusions with which the departments were unable to agree, that would be made clear and the NAO and departments&#146; reasons properly represented with all necessary balance. The House will note tonight that my Amendment No. 175 is almost a straight lift from the minute of the Public Accounts Committee of 1986.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080311116000010"></a>Amendment No. 176 deals with the circumstances in which the committee and Government could not agree, and where the difference of opinion had to be referred to Parliament. In those circumstances, the Government would put their proposal to Parliament under the affirmative procedure. If defeated, they would then be required to put the committee&#146;s proposal under similar procedural arrangements. To sum up, we have a mechanism here for seeking agreement, taking decisions, making recommendations and, where irreconcilable differences exist, referring them to Parliament for resolution of the dispute. While the committee could exercise a right to take decisions, it could also make recommendations&#151;these things being distinctly different. The whole process could be further improved by a reference in Parliament to a Joint Committee which could refer its views to Parliament to aid resolution of the dispute. In my view, there will be many, many disputes.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080311116000011"></a>Governments of all persuasions will inevitably be tempted to duck big decisions; that is what concerns  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1456"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>me. A whole generation of young people out there are interested in climate change and look to Parliament now, in this Bill, to introduce mechanisms which will avoid such conflicts. They are reliant on us, now, at the beginning of this millennium, to influence climate change over the rest of this century.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080311116000012"></a>Many of the decisions will be very controversial. To give an example, only yesterday, we had the Kingsnorth announcement, which was immediately opposed by many environmental groups on the basis that we were not dealing with the issue of carbon and CO2 emissions. We will be ever confronted with those kinds of problems in government. Very often, because of the power of outside lobbying organisations, Governments will be forced to back down.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080311116000013"></a>Another example is the decision taken by the Mayor of London on the Porsche congestion charge. Porsche is now going to judicial review. That is a further example of the kind of pressure that can be exerted on government&#151;in this case, the Mayor&#151;where very controversial decisions have to be taken. I want a mechanism that the Government can hold responsible for those decisions and, to use a phrase that I used before, on occasion, perhaps even hide behind that body, so that the public understand that we have given others a responsibility to take major decisions. I have previously cited the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. It is far easier for it to handle decisions of that magnitude than it was for the Chancellor when he or she knew that he or she would inevitably be confronted by electoral and other political considerations in the taking of decisions on interest rates.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080311116000014"></a>We need a committee with a dynamic tension in its relationship with government, in which the committee recognises the utmost seriousness with which it has to take its decisions. What is most important is that a chasm is not allowed to develop between the committee, the Government and public opinion: a chasm in which the public and the committee blame the Government for failing to act; in which successive Governments blame their predecessors for failing to act; and in which successive Secretaries of State blame their predecessors for failing to meet targets recommended by the Climate Change Committee. That would be the blame game at its worst, and I am fearful that that is what will happen, inevitably with an exasperated public looking on. We all know about drifts in public policy and in government decision-taking. My amendment is intended to stop that.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080311116000015"></a>Finally, I turn to an issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, when we were originally discussing these issues in Committee. He referred to politicisation of the committee. I think that we have completely misunderstood what the internal dynamics of that committee will be in the circumstances to which I am referring. I think that you get politicisation where individuals have only influence. The moment that you give them real power to take decisions, you will not get politics. You will find that the committee combines in those conditions to avoid political argument and to come out with a consensus view with which it can carry government with it. The danger is that the less

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080311116000016"></a>I listened very carefully to the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson&#151;he referred to it again this evening in response to my noble friend Lord Rooker. I think that he should reconsider the issue of politicisation before the Bill goes to the House of Commons, because, as I have said, a major misjudgment is taking place on this issue. I beg to move.</p>

They lift the committee above its advisory role and place a duty on it to make decisions on budget-setting. We certainly welcome the amendments. The budget periods are scientific demarcations. Budget periods should not be set based on what a Government think that they could achieve, but because that is what we must achieve to stop climate change.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080311116000018"></a>I do not know whether this is the perfect place in the Bill to bring about this shift. In the process of amending the Bill, we have made progress towards the Conservative goal of putting the committee centre stage. In order to preserve the balance&#151;or, as I have referred to it, the triangular relationship&#151;between the committee, the Government and Parliament, it may be necessary to preserve some power in the hands of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080311116000019"></a>However, to my mind, the amendments seem, by and large, to get it right. The Government's role in this process is to make policy and programmes to meet the budgets. Obliging the committee to decide on those budgets enshrines the assessment of the success or failure of a Government in an essential mantle of objectivity. If the committee decides on the amount that we must reduce in five years, that amount will be based on scientific necessity. That should be the end of the story. Politicising budget periods would be a dangerous way to miss our overall target.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080311116000020"></a>Amendment No. 175, regarding the duty of the Secretary of State and the committee to agree the reports, is interesting. We certainly welcome its spirit, as it goes a long way to further the strength of the committee. However, it is difficult to know precisely how that would work in practice. We certainly welcome the idea that if the Secretary of State diverges from the opinion of the committee and does not take its advice, it will be necessary for him to publish a report outlining why and in what circumstances there has been disagreement. To have a duty to agree seems to go a bit far&#151;or, perhaps, misses the point. The dialogue between the Secretary of State and the committee should be open, constant and publicly reported on. If there is disagreement, that should be just as open and public.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080311116000021"></a>That is where Parliament steps in as the third point of the triangle to scrutinise the actions of the Secretary of State and to evaluate whether there are justifiable reasons for ignoring the experts. That is also a way in which the public and Parliament can scrutinise a Government's approach to climate change, and get rid

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080311116000022"></a>Placing a duty to agree seems to cut out that aspect of the balance&#151;although perhaps I misunderstand the intention behind that duty. None the less, I look forward to hearing the Minister's response about how he sees the precise relationship between the committee, the Government and Parliament.</p>

Since the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, laid down the challenge to me, I have been trying to think through my rationale on this. This is a more intermediate issue. I was especially concerned that the climate change committee should not itself decide policy, because policy is inevitably political. You can meet individual targets by a number of routes by different policy mixes. In our mind, that was clearly the duty and responsibility of the Secretary of State and the Government, rather than of a committee that is largely unaccountable. When it comes to setting the budgets, I am not sure that the problem goes away. Just to decide what particular budget periods are, the committee has to look at the policy options required. I agree that there might be a number of those.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080311116000024"></a>There is a difference between politicisation in the way I am describing it and the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, described it. He said that if a body can only give advice, corporate politics begin to try to get the ear of people in putting across particular arguments so that the other side accepts that solution. I understand that, and I think that it is almost inevitable in any organisation. However, the politicisation that I am talking about is that as soon as a body is able to make decisions, which, effectively, the Government have to work around, the lobbying that goes into it is immense. It is all concentrated on the body rather than on the democratic institutions of the state. I differ from noble Lords on a number of things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080311116000025"></a>We talk about the science being correct. I take the <I>New Scientist</I><I></I>every week&#151;that is not a brag, it is just to get out of the groove of politics. The scientific community will always say that there is no one answer to everything, that nearly everything is a hypothesis and that the science will move on. The rigour of science is peer review, different opinions and assessment. A single solution appears very infrequently. We need to ensure that we do not fall into that fallacy in the way that we look at the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080311116000026"></a>On my way in this morning, I was reading an article about the different theories of dark matter. I will not go into any of those, except to say that science has at least a dozen different opinions on the missing matter in the universe that cause constant expansion rather than a big crunch. A perfect solution for the whole area is indeterminate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080311116000027"></a>In this area, there is still that risk of politicisation that the Minister quoted back at me earlier. It is still a step too far for an effectively unaccountable and appointed body. Once the body has executive powers, the way that people are appointed will suddenly become far more political. We want types of decisions and appointments similar to those on the present

I agree that is not a big step, with these amendments, to have executive powers, but it is still a step too far. I believe that the Secretary of State and the Government need to be accountable for this level of decision and, in that way, to be responsible to Parliament.</p>

Before the Monetary Policy Committee was set up there was a public debate, not just here but across the world, about central bank independence. A lot of us did not agree with it but there was a debate at least for 20 years. Inflation was a danger, and a central bank had an instrument to control inflation&#151;a dubious one perhaps, but it had an instrument. The analogy does not apply because the committee has no instrument to control carbon emissions. It can set a budget but it cannot enforce anything. I would rather we leave it to the Government, although it is imperfect, because you cannot avoid politicisation and I would rather the Government be politicised than an expert committee.</p>

He has taken time to consider this and to refer to his previous experience on the Public Accounts Committee, which we shared for a period in the other place, so I can see where he is coming from. I take the point of noble Lord, Lord Teverson, about the science moving and constantly evolving. I am one of the few people that I know who read the whole of <I>A Brief History of Time</I>. In what is a very small but significant book, I remember a paragraph in which there is a discussion on the theory of the universe, and Stephen Hawking concluded that there was nothing for the creator to do because it was there all the while. Others have challenged that view.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080311116000030"></a>The Government have given serious thought to the amendments. We have looked at them in some depth, and our view is that while they may appear at first sight to strengthen the role of the Committee on Climate Change, its independence and accountability, in reality they are likely to have a different effect from that intended. They may reduce the transparency and independence of the process for taking decisions on carbon budgets. Perhaps I may take some time setting out the reasons for that view, because it is important that we are clear about the effect of the amendments, for my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours as much as for Third Reading and Members of the other place. </p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080311116000031"></a>The amendments give the committee responsibility for deciding on the level of the carbon budgets, but also include a requirement for the committee to agree the contents of its reports with the Secretary of State. Where agreement cannot be reached, the committee must omit the relevant fact, decision or recommendation from its report and the Secretary of State must then report to Parliament explaining the omission and why agreement was not reached. Taken at face value, that appears to increase transparency by highlighting any differences in opinion, until one considers that all the discussions about whether to agree the committee&#146;s report and decisions will take place behind closed doors.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1460"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1460</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80311-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080311116000032"></a>If the committee and the Secretary of State agree the committee&#146;s report, neither Parliament nor the public will have any insight into the discussions that took place prior to publication. They will have no way of knowing whether one party modified its original view on an issue in order to reach agreement or the evidence that persuaded them to change their view.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080311116000033"></a>Let us compare this with the system proposed by the Bill. The Committee on Climate Change will provide advice to Government on the level of the budgets, and include the reasons for its advice. The advice will be published and it will be out in the open for everyone to look at for up to six months before the Secretary of State sets the budgets. There will be a public debate and, no doubt, parliamentary debate as well: has the committee got it right; do we agree with the analysis; is there an alternative view? If, having considered the committee&#146;s advice, the Secretary of State decides to set the budget at a different level, under the Bill he must publish a statement setting out the reasons for the decision. That ensures that any disagreement, and the reasons for it, will be transparent open and seen by the public.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080311116000034"></a>The amendments of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours also appear to increase the role of Parliament, but we do not believe that they do. Under the system in the Bill, an order setting the carbon budget will be subject to affirmative procedure. Therefore, Parliament will have the opportunity to debate the level of the budget fully, having had the opportunity to consider at length the committee&#146;s advice, as well as any statement published by the Secretary of State explaining why he disagrees with the advice.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080311116000035"></a>Of course, Parliament has the right to reject the order if it believes that the Secretary of State has made the wrong decision. That is why we have made the process subject to affirmative procedure. Therefore, I cannot see that the amendments add to Parliament&#146;s role in scrutinising the setting of the carbon budgets.</p>

It is true that the orders are unamendable&#151;almost like the nuclear option&#151;so I understand the difficulty, but the group of amendments tabled by my noble friend do not add to Parliament&#146;s role in scrutinising the setting of the carbon budgets.

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080311116000038"></a>Finally, there is another reason why the model of the National Audit Office&#146;s relationship with departments is inappropriate for the committee. I understand my noble friend, and see that his amendments are seductive, as the system is tried and tested and works extremely well. However, the NAO&#146;s reports tend in the main to  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1461"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be backward-looking&#151;a study in some detail about what has happened to taxpayers&#146; pounds. This is why so much emphasis is placed on agreeing that the facts of the case are accurate and not in dispute, so that no permanent Secretary of State or accounting officer can ever say when the reports are published that the facts and figures are wrong. That gets that completely out of the way at the beginning. The Public Accounts Committee&#146;s inquiries can then get straight to the nub of the issue, and the facts are agreed.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080311116000039"></a>In contrast, the climate change committee&#146;s advice on budgets is definitely forward-looking and based on projections of what might happen. There is therefore more uncertainty, and there could be a range of interpretations about what might happen. It is therefore not possible in the main to agree the facts in the same way as the National Audit Office agrees with departments. I will illustrate this with an example.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080311116000040"></a>In December 2010&#151;this is a futuristic example&#151;the climate change committee will publish its advice on the budget for the years 2023 to 2027. In other words, it will look up to 17 years ahead, so it is simply not possible to say what the facts are so far in advance. However, requiring the committee to agree the facts of the matter with the Government so that they were not in dispute would in essence require the committee to agree all its analysis with the Government. This could undermine its independence. Given that we will be looking up to 17 years ahead, the committee might take a different approach from the Government to its projections for the future. That is a practical view of the difference between the committee and the NAO. I am not saying that the model that my noble friend has used is incorrect, but it does not fit the purposes of the climate change committee.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080311116000041"></a>We agreed in Committee that the climate change committee, with Parliament, will help to hold the Government, and for that matter the country as a whole, accountable for the progress that we are making towards our 2050 target. That is why it is important that the committee can provide independent, expert, transparent and credible analysis, unfettered by any need for prior agreement with the Government or Ministers. It is vital that that is maintained, and that we get the balance of power between the different institutions exactly right, or certainly right from a practical, workable point of view.</p>

<a name="80311-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080311116000042"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendments do not do this. They risk concealing discussions between government and the committee, which could undermine the credibility of the committee&#146;s advice. In contrast, the system proposed in the Bill will be stronger and more robust and with a stronger role for Parliament in holding the Government to account. I am grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue and for the detail and the care with which he did so, but I hope that he does not proceed with the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080311116000044"></a>I recognise what my noble friend said about looking forward as against looking back, but the Monetary Policy Committee looks forward. Indeed, there are circumstances in which we accept the decisions of an independent committee whose function is to look forward. My noble friend said that Parliament&#146;s influence would be reduced. I dispute that, because in the event that Parliament did not approve the decisions of the Government or their recommendations to Parliament, Parliament would have the right to vote on the climate change committee&#146;s recommendation or decision. That is a substantial additional power. My noble friend referred to the procedural limitations, but the reality is that it is wrong, and if officials in the department thought that, they would look more closely at my amendment, which would give substantially more power to Parliament to decide.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080311116000045"></a>My noble friend raised the very interesting issue of the debate behind closed doors, which I had not thought about and which needs further consideration. My preliminary view of that is that there is a suggestion that people on the climate change committee would compromise on what they really believed in behind closed doors with government in the knowledge that their acceptance of a consensus view might not stand the test of time and might turn out to be an error. They might as a committee be completely convinced by a position, but my noble friend is suggesting that they might be inclined to compromise with government behind closed doors. The credibility and integrity of people on that committee are such that it is far more likely that they will stand their ground on issues on which they believe that their personal credibility as scientists evaluating the science in this area is involved.</p>

Both amendments deal with the boundary between what the climate change committee should do, advise or have executive power over and what the domain of government should be. There is an important role for the climate change committee, as an independent advisory body, in looking forward and making a technical assessment of whether government policies and programmes of the time will meet proposed carbon budgets of the current period in its annual reports.

That is not a politicised issue because it is not up to the Committee on Climate Change to decide on those budgets, because that has already been decided. Nor is it the role of the committee to decide what policy adjustments are needed to get to those targets. It is an early-warning, objective look by an important body to see and to report&#151;it is open to the public and to Parliament&#151;and to assess whether the Government&#146;s policies are likely to be successful in meeting the targets that they have agreed should be set.</p>

I am not sure why the committee is being asked to provide this assessment twice, although I understand the noble Lord&#146;s motivation. We are talking about doing this, possibly, within six months. We therefore think that under Clause 27 the committee should focus on advising on the most appropriate level of carbon budgets needed to achieve the long-term targets. We should remember that this advice is to be given at least 11 years before the beginning of the relevant budget period.

Thus I hope that the Minister will explain the reason for including his amendment and will consider, perhaps at Third Reading, revising this clause to reflect that the committee should give advice, if it deems it necessary, on the contributions of sectors to the budget, both individually and as a whole. I beg to move.</p>

Whether we are the fourth or the sixth largest economy in the world&#151;it depends on how one counts comparative purchase power&#151;the non-EU ETS sector is some 48 per cent of our economy. I remind the House that everyone is very clear that we do not want a rigid, five-year sectoral planning system that harks back to the failed days of the Soviet Union. We are talking about greater transparency in how the Committee on Climate Change and the Government will make their decisions, and how they might affect individual sectors, which is useful for tracking

It is much too large to do that in just two sectors&#151;the EU ETS and, I presume, the carbon reduction commitment sector, and the rest of the economy. I am assuming here also, and I shall be interested in the Minister&#146;s response, that due to the detailed level of reporting in emissions trading schemes&#151;both the European one and the proposed CRC&#151;there will be a natural breakdown available of that 52 per cent to 60 per cent of the economy. Certainly, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has said, it would be very strange if we had one figure just for the remaining 40 per cent. We are talking about understanding these issues and movements in a great deal more detail.</p>

We had a discussion on sectoral targets on the first day of Report, including on government Amendment No. 144. It would ensure that the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s advice to the Secretary of State on the level of each carbon budget considers the sectors of the economy in which there are particular opportunities for contributions to be made towards meeting the carbon budget.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080311116000065"></a>Let me put it on the record that we consider that, in providing its advice under Clause 27 concerning the contribution of trading schemes taken as a whole, it is highly likely that the Committee on Climate Change will need to consider the contribution that should be made in each sector covered by the individual trading schemes. Clause 27 requires the committee to publish its advice on budgets, including its reasons for this advice, but we think it would be overly restrictive to specifically require the committee to recommend the cap for each individual trading scheme as part of its advice on carbon budgets, which would be the result of this amendment. That is a policy-making role and, as we have discussed previously, we do not believe the committee should have a role on individual policies. For the reasons we have set out previously, we think this would politicise the committee&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080311116000066"></a>The danger with Amendment No. 143 is that it comes very close to a situation where the Committee on Climate Change would be given a mandatory role in considering individual policies. For its advice to be credible the committee has got to work outside the political arena and, therefore, outside decision-making on particular policy mechanisms. We do not want the committee to become involved in the nitty-gritty of policy decisions on ranges of issues in different sectors, whether home insulation, domestic boilers, wind farms and so on. All these are matters for the Government, who are held accountable by Parliament and the people for their decisions.</p>

To some degree our amendments arise out of a belief that the sectors are going to be important contributors to our success on climate change, so to be able to include them fully in the process is extremely important. I take some comfort from the fact that government Amendment No. 144 recognises this. Given that situation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080311116000081"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we have already discussed similar issues in relation to Amendments Nos. 142 and 159.

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080311116000082"></a>I am also mindful of our discussion of Amendment No. 22, which was proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, for a compliance mechanism to be included in the Bill. At the time we explained why we believed that government Amendment No. 81 would work better. Part of the  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1467"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1467</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reason for this is that the Bill&#146;s other provisions for annual accountability, with the addition of government Amendments Nos. 157 and 171, remove the need for yet another layer of annual processes as proposed in Amendment No. 22.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080311116000083"></a>It may be helpful if I can briefly recap on the Bill&#146;s relevant provisions as context for the amendments in this group and in further illustration of why we do not think that Amendment No. 21 is needed. Before I explain the approach we have taken in government Amendments Nos. 157 and 171, it would be useful to get this on the record at this stage.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080311116000084"></a>For each budget period the Secretary of State must publish proposals and policies for meeting each budget. Government amendments now agreed by this House also require the Secretary of State to publish an indicative annual statement setting out the progress expected in each year of the budgetary period, together with the timescales over which policies are expected to take effect. There will be maximum transparency about the progress expected, both on policies and on our emission reduction trajectory, throughout the budgetary period. I honestly do not see what further information could be provided on this. That is looking forward.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080311116000085"></a>Clause 12 requires the Government to publish, for every year of the budget period, a detailed emissions statement. This will set out the facts on how much progress is being made. Every year the Committee on Climate Change will lay a progress report before Parliament under Clause 28 which will give the committee&#146;s views on the progress being made towards meeting the budgets and the 2050 target, and then the Government must respond under Clause 29. So if there are any concerns about progress during the budget period, there are already extremely strong mechanisms to make sure that they are identified at an early stage and reported quickly and transparently to the public and to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080311116000086"></a>I turn to government Amendments Nos. 157 and 171. Amendment No. 157 adds further specifications to what must be included in the committee&#146;s annual report under Clause 28. If the amendment is agreed to, the report must refer to progress made so far towards meeting the targets and budgets, to progress that remains to be made and whether, in the committee&#146;s view, the targets and budgets are likely to be met. In making this assessment the committee will of course be able to use the information provided in the Government&#146;s plan for meeting budgets and the timescale for expected progress.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080311116000087"></a>Amendment No. 157 builds on this by requiring that the Government&#146;s annual response to the committee&#146;s progress report under Clause 29 would be specifically required to respond to the points made by the committee. That is very important from the noble Lord&#146;s point of view. This will ensure that Parliament is better able to hold the Government to account for progress. Therefore, if the Government are off-track in any particular year towards meeting the overall budget, it will be quite clear from both the emissions figures and the committee&#146;s assessment, and the Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s assessment will need to be comprehensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080311116000088"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 157 and 171 substantially strengthen this part of the Bill. An additional

Prior to these amendments, the Bill did not have a dynamic and thorough reporting procedure. By this I mean that it did not have a mechanism to take into account the nature of the progress made. Although the Government seem to have finally diagnosed the problem, to some degree their solutions are unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="80311-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080311124000003"></a>It is good to have an explicit recognition in the Bill that the report will include what needs to be done and a statement on whether the targets will be met. Indeed, we hope that this will include an assessment of the effectiveness of the action; it implies such an assessment in any case. However, we think it important that the report on progress should examine not only the likelihood of meeting the targets but also the actions that have been, and are being, taken to meet them. That is a crucial difference.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080311124000012"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft order is made under Section 5 of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which was passed last month. Under the provisions of that Act and of the Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2008, Northern Rock was brought into a period of temporary public ownership on 22 February this year, with shares transferred to the Treasury Solicitor as nominee for the Treasury. Section 5 of the Act requires the Treasury to establish a scheme to determine the amount of any compensation payable to shareholders or to holders of share options.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080311124000013"></a>The House will recognise the need for a fair and proper way of assessing the amount of any compensation that should be paid in those circumstances. The crucial point is that any compensation must be fair, which means that it should be based on a realistic assessment of the shares&#146; value without public support. Taxpayers should not be expected to pay compensation for value that would not exist without their support.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080311124000014"></a>The Act therefore makes it clear that, in the assessment of the amount of any compensation, two assumptions must be made: first, that all financial assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury is withdrawn; and, secondly, that no further public assistance, beyond ordinary market assistance from the Bank of England, would be provided. In addition, and as provided for by Section 9 of the Act, the order that we are considering today specifies that it should also be assumed that Northern Rock would be unable to continue as a going concern and would be in administration.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080311124000015"></a>It is clear that, if it was not for the financial support from the Government and the Bank of England, not only would Northern Rock not have been able to continue as a going concern but it would have been placed in administration at best. As has been shown by the extensive search undertaken by Northern Rock&#146;s management, with the support of the tripartite authorities, it was not possible to find a private sector solution that met our three principles, particularly that of protecting the taxpayer. If the financial assistance provided by the Government and the Bank of England had been withdrawn, it is clear that Northern Rock would not have been able to secure the substantial amount of alternative funding that would have been required. As a result, it is only fair to make the assumption, when determining the amount of any compensation, not only that public support has been withdrawn but that without that support Northern Rock plc would not be a going concern and would have been placed in administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080311124000016"></a>As well as those assumptions, the order sets out that the amount of any compensation payable will be determined by an independent valuer appointed by the Treasury. We intend to advertise for expressions of interest in that position shortly, if the House agrees to the order. The Treasury will then make an appointment in consultation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. We will of course be looking for someone who is independent of all interested parties, with extensive company valuation skills and the ability to handle the range of relevant stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080311124000017"></a>Once an independent valuer has been appointed, they will need to appoint staff and decide on the process to be followed. The valuer will then come to a decision on the amount of any compensation payable, based, of course, on the assumptions that I spoke about a moment ago. Once that assessment has been made, anybody who is affected will be able to ask the valuer to reconsider his or her determination and a revised assessment will then be made. Anyone affected who is dissatisfied with that revised assessment will then be able to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080311124000018"></a>I hope that I have explained clearly the background to the order and its purpose. As I said, it is right that we should establish a fair way of assessing the amount of any compensation payable to people who have lost their shares or had their share options or certain other rights extinguished as a result of the transfer. Any compensation must be fair and must not overvalue Northern Rock on the basis of public support. Without that support, Northern Rock would not be able to continue as a going concern and would be in administration. If it had not been for the Government&#146;s support since September, that would have been the case long ago and it would certainly have been the case when the transfer was made.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="080311124000019"></a>I therefore believe that this order is the fairest way forward. It is fair that the value of any compensation should be determined by an independent valuer, but only on the assumption that public support was no longer available. This order allows for that to happen in a clear way, with opportunities to seek review of the valuer&#146;s decision, and I hope that the House will support it. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="080311124000022"></a>The Government did accept that the compensation orders which could be made under various sections of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 would be subject to the affirmative procedure, which is why we are here this evening.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080311124000023"></a>The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee of your Lordships&#146; House has drawn the attention of the House to the orders on the grounds that they give rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the House. We are always grateful for the observations of the excellent Merits Committee, but I think that in this instance we were fully alive to the fact that this is not an order merely to be nodded through.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080311124000024"></a>I will focus my remarks on Article 6 of the order which lays down the valuation assumptions that the valuer is to use and restricts the valuer quite considerably. I would like to probe with the Minister why the Government chose to include Article 6, as well as what the Government intend to be the meaning of the Article.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080311124000025"></a>Section 5 of the Act makes it clear that in determining compensation it must be assumed that all financial assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury has been withdrawn and that no future assistance would be provided&#151;apart from ordinary market assistance. The Minister has already referred to that. If that were the only guidance available, a valuer would then have to see whether and to what extent any alternative sources of funds would have been available.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080311124000026"></a>From what little the Government have chosen to put in the public arena about the prolonged and abortive sale negotiations, it appears that there was no deal on offer which could have seen Northern Rock going forward without special financial assistance from the Bank of England or the Government. Therefore, if Treasury or Bank financial support were withdrawn, the likely next step would have been for Northern Rock to be placed in administration. It is not clear beyond peradventure, however, that Northern Rock is not a going concern in some form. Indeed, we must assume that the Government&#146;s rationale for installing the expensive team led by Mr Sandler was to deliver an ongoing viable business. In that light, will the Minister say why the Government put Article 6 in the order, which requires the valuer to assume that the company is in administration and is not a going concern, rather than leaving the valuer to reach a judgment on the basis of the facts as they found them? Is the paragraph concealing some facts about the financial position of Northern Rock that would be relevant to a valuer but which the Government do not want in the public domain, in particular in relation to the &#147;going concern&#148; nature of the business?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080311124000027"></a>I turn to the detail of Article 6. I could not find a definition of the term &#147;in administration&#148; in the order, though I assume that the Government intend this to mean an administration within the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that or indicate what the phrase is intended to mean.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080311124000028"></a>As I am sure the Minister is aware, an administrator is required by the 2002 Act to perform his functions with the objective of,</p>
<ul><a name="080311124000058"></a>&#147;rescuing the company as a going concern, or ... achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration), or ... realising property in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1472"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080311124000046"></a>Will the Minister explain how this definition of administration fits with Article 6 of the order? Does Article 6(a), which requires the valuer to assume that Northern Rock,</p>
<ul><a name="080311124000059"></a>&#147;is unable to continue as a going concern&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000047"></a>mean that our hypothetical administration must ignore any possibility of,</p>
<ul><a name="080311124000060"></a>&#147;rescuing the company as a going concern&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000048"></a>as set out in the 2002 Act?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080311124000029"></a>If the valuer must focus only on the second two legs of the 2002 Act&#151;namely, achieving a better result for creditors as a whole or realising property for secured or preferential creditors&#151;will the Minister say what this means in practice? I presume that achieving a better result for creditors might involve some corporate restructuring and creating positive value, which could in turn be sold as a going concern. That may be what Mr Sandler is now working on. I hope that the Minister can shed some light on this, both for the House tonight and for the benefit of the valuer when he or she is appointed and starts work.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080311124000030"></a>Whenever we in this House or my honourable or right honourable friends in another place raised the possibility of administration as an alternative to nationalisation, government Ministers always characterised administration as equivalent to a fire sale&#151;the Minister has used those terms. We never believed that insolvency law provisions relating to administration could or should be seen in such a simplistic light, and I hope that the Minister will tonight confirm that the Government&#146;s use of the assumption of administration in Article 6 is not intended as an instruction to the valuer to perform a fire sale valuation.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080311124000031"></a>I hope that the Minister can also answer a question which is relevant to any valuer and to your Lordships&#146; understanding of the company, which is now in public ownership. When will we be allowed to see the business plan of Northern Rock? I understand that the plan must be submitted to Brussels by next Monday, and so it must be ready or very nearly so. During the passage of the Act, the Minister referred to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="080311124000053"></a>&#147;The bank&#146;s business plan, which will be developed in the coming weeks and must be agreed with the Government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000049"></a>He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="080311124000054"></a>&#147;I can commit to keep the House fully informed as that planning work reaches a conclusion ... a strategic plan will be communicated to the House in due course ... there certainly will be no delay&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/2/08; cols. 301-02.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000050"></a>We have not yet seen the business plan.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080311124000032"></a>While we are on the subject of commitments made during the passage of the Act, perhaps the Minister will also tell the House when noble Lords may see the framework agreement which is to set out the Government&#146;s relationships as both shareholder in and lender to Northern Rock. On 21 February, the Minister told my noble friend Lord De Mauley that the framework agreement would be published &#147;as rapidly as possible&#148;, but I believe that, three weeks later, it has not yet seen the light of day.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080311124000033"></a>The Minister will know that the small shareholders, many of whom will have acquired their shares as members of the demutualised Northern Rock Building Society, feel aggrieved by Article 6. They have been  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1473"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confused by repeated assertions by the Government that Northern Rock was a going concern, with a good-quality loan book, and that it was solvent. The shares in Northern Rock continued to be traded on the London Stock Exchange until the Government finally announced their intention to nationalise it. The closing price before that announcement was 90p. Will the Minister put on the record for those small shareholders why the Government are taking away their shares on the basis of assumptions which are at odds with their repeated statements about Northern Rock during the autumn? Will the Minister explain to them how 90p compares with the valuation that they expect to be produced by their Article 6 assumptions?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080311124000034"></a>The Government showed disdain for small shareholders when they nationalised Network Rail&#151;the Minister&#146;s noble friend Lady Vadera famously referred to them as &#147;grannies in blouses&#148;. I hope that the Minister will tonight eschew that disdain and set out fully and for the record why their chosen valuation process is fair and reasonable for small shareholders.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="080311124000035"></a>At the other end of the investor spectrum are sophisticated international investors, including hedge funds, and they are equally unhappy about the valuation basis. All of us doubtless read in the weekend newspapers about the legal actions that they are contemplating, including human rights challenges and judicial review. I would not expect the Minister to be able to comment substantively on that today.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="080311124000036"></a>However, I would like him to deal with a rather more generic issue which may have a bearing on the compensation settlements. Will he confirm that the UK has entered into a number of bilateral treaties with the aim of protecting investors from the effects of expropriation? Many of these treaties&#151;I believe that there are about 85 in total&#151;are with developing countries, and I expect that the driving force behind them was the desire to protect UK investors from foreign expropriation. But the treaties are bilateral and hence protect foreign investors in the UK in the same way. For example, one of the treaties is with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which still has a dynamic financial community and is home to many hedge funds. Investors who bought Northern Rock shares through Hong Kong entities may well be able to use the bilateral treaty compensation principles which provide, in Article 5, for compensation based on,</p>
<ul><a name="080311124000061"></a>&#147;the real value immediately before the deprivation or before the impending deprivation became public knowledge whichever is the earlier&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000037"></a>That seems to set at 90p a compensation floor for any investors who can take advantage of such a treaty, but there will be a lot of scope for arguing that the &#147;real value&#148; referred to in Article 5 has to eliminate the extent to which the threat of nationalisation was already embedded in that price. A figure of &#163;4 per share has been talked about in the press, but there are other plausible values&#151;perhaps a pre-credit crunch value of &#163;8 or &#163;9 might be argued for. I do not expect the Minister to comment on these values.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080311124000038"></a>The crucial point about these bilateral treaties, on which I should value the Minister&#146;s comments, is that  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1474"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disputes about compensation bypass the UK courts completely. For example, Article 8 of the Hong Kong treaty to which I have referred states that, if no settlement is reached, there is to be arbitration under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="080311124000039"></a>Have the Government considered the impact of these bilateral treaties? Do they believe that it would be tenable to have two or more incompatible valuations proceeding in respect of the same class of shares? Or, perhaps more pertinently, do the Government believe that they can get away with an internationally arbitrated value for powerful institutional shareholders while paying a smaller sum to a small shareholder in the north-east, resulting from Article 6 valuation assumptions?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="080311124000040"></a>I would now like to ask the Minister about the appointment of an independent valuer. As a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, I suppose that I should be flattered that that institute should be consulted. But, actually, I can see little point in this bit of the process, though it has been suggested that the Government needed the help of the institute to persuade people of quality to consider the job because of the reputation risk involved.</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="080311124000041"></a>Of much more importance is how the valuer will be selected. I hope that the Government will not think about making this appointment without a competitive tender. That is not the same as an &#147;expression of interest&#148;, which is the phrase the Minister used when introducing the order. This contract will be valuable to the person appointed and his or her firm. The valuation process will doubtless drag on for years as all appeal avenues are exhausted&#151;and time costs money . How will the Treasury determine value for money if it has not carried out a competitive tender?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="080311124000042"></a>The Minister would not expect any debate on Northern Rock to take place without some reference to Granite. The Government have not explicitly included Granite within the nationalisation order, as has been debated at some length. The Chancellor asserted in his letter to Mr Vince Cable that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a><a name="080311124000055"></a>&#147;Granite and only Granite is liable to its bondholders under any scenario. The Government have not provided any guarantee arrangements to Granite's bondholders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000051"></a>It now appears that the Government were being economical with the truth. The analysis by the Office for National Statistics given last week to the Treasury Select Committee in another place is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a><a name="080311124000056"></a>&#147;The securitisation structure leads ... to the financial risks and rewards associated with [Granite's] assets remaining with Northern Rock plc&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311124000052"></a>Since Northern Rock plc is owned by the Government, Granite&#146;s liabilities are now de facto those of the Government. Will the Minister confirm that this valuation process cannot ignore Granite, and, indeed, will have to reflect the full amount of Granite&#146;s assets and liabilities?</p>

<a name="80311-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="080311124000043"></a>Since we are talking about the liabilities of Northern Rock, will the Minister confirm&#151;what has been widely reported in the press&#151;that the Chancellor in his Budget statement tomorrow will try to ignore or footnote Northern Rock's liabilities? The Minister may try to wriggle out of this and tell me to wait until tomorrow.

I cannot match the erudition of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on the definitions used in that paragraph, but, surely the reality those words reflect is that without government intervention Northern Rock would have gone bust in September of last year. Therefore, is not the effect of that, and of those assumptions, to value the shares at zero? If that, as it appears, is the case, I would be grateful if the Minister could say a bit more about what he envisages the valuer doing. Why does he need a staff to do it? How long it is going to take to do it? And how much is the process likely to cost?</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080311132000004"></a>The Minister may recall that my colleague, Vince Cable, pointed out at an early stage that if the Government had only taken his advice on nationalisation, they would have saved millions of pounds in fees for Goldman Sachs. In order not to make the same mistake again, will the Government accept an offer from my noble friend Lord Oakeshott to value Northern Rock shares for nothing, and to do so extremely quickly?</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080311132000005"></a>There has been much speculation about legal action. Shareholders, both small and large, have contemplated legal action. I suspect that for the hedge funds they have to proceed with legal action to cover the fact that they made a huge bet and lost. For small shareholders, it seems to me that legal action poses a number of risks. First, they are, understandably, very frustrated at the situation in which they find themselves. Whether or not the shares are valued at nothing, they are clearly going to be valued at virtually nothing. They quite understandably are, first, looking to see who to blame, and, secondly, against whom they have a course of action. It seems to me that there is a real danger that they may go down a legal route and put in a lot of money pursuing legal avenues, which are offered to them by unscrupulous lawyers who see this as a way of making a significant amount of fee income. I hope very much&#151;I do not expect the Minister to comment on this; it is obviously up to small shareholders to decide what they are going to do&#151;that they are dissuaded from spending significant amounts of their own money on legal actions, which are almost certainly bound to fail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="080311132000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked the Minister about two documents which featured quite large in our debates on the nationalisation Bill. The first was the framework agreement. The framework agreement is, as it were, the instructions from the Government to Ron Sandler about how they want Northern Rock to  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1476"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be run. It is not the business plan. When we were discussing the matter with Ministers and officials on the day of Second Reading, we were given the impression that this document was virtually completed and that it might be ready for scrutiny by your Lordships when we came to Committee stage and took the Bill through the following day. That was, bar a day, three weeks ago. As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, we find it extremely surprising that what must be, by definition, a short document&#151;possibly it has not been concluded&#151;has not been put in the public domain. We feel that the Government gave the House the impression that this document was ready to be put in the public domain within days of our discussions, if not hours, and it would be very interesting to know why that framework document has not hit the Library at least.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="080311132000007"></a>The second document is the business plan. As the noble Baroness said, we understand that that has to be submitted within the week.

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="080311132000008"></a>Finally&#151;it is almost like a coda to any discussion on Northern Rock&#151;the noble Baroness raised a big issue about Granite and the fact that the ONS has been able to give a degree of clarity about Granite which Ministers, either by accident or design, have completely failed to do on the Floors of both Houses and in the letter sent to my colleague in another place, Vince Cable. Perhaps I may repeat her questions. Will the Minister confirm that ONS has decided that all the assets of Granite will be included in the Northern Rock debts which will sit on the Government&#146;s books, and that the total amount is therefore in the order of &#163;90 billion? There is still a reasonable amount of confusion about a number of aspects of Granite, but if the Minister could at least give confirmation about that issue, it would be one less area of confusion to which we would need to return in the future.</p>

Although the Minister has told us that no serious proposal was ever received, it is clear to me that if the Government had responded with more positive indications of the kind of financial support they would have been prepared to give to an inquirer at that time, it is extremely likely that that institution would have come forward with a firm proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="080311132000012"></a>Much has been said about the subject of Granite and I do not want to repeat what many noble Lords have already pointed out. However, it is clear that Granite should have been included in the nationalisation. Note 22 to the consolidated accounts of Northern Rock at 31 December 2006 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a><a name="080311132000203"></a>&#147;Although the Company has no direct or indirect ownership interest in these companies&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080311132000188"></a>If they are regarded as legal subsidiaries of Northern Rock plc, that means that they are clearly legal subsidiaries owned by the shareholder of Northern Rock plc; that is, the Government.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080311132000013"></a>I should like briefly to address the question of the Government's adviser, Goldman Sachs. I feel that the public have not been informed enough about the basis on which Goldman Sachs was appointed as adviser to the Government, what its remit was, or indeed whether it was paid a success fee. In other words, was the ultimate decision on the solution for Northern Rock regarded as a success or not? I wonder whether the selection of an independent valuer under this order will be subject to a similar kind of process as the appointment of the Government's investment bank advisers.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="080311132000014"></a>I should like to comment on the Northern Rock Foundation. Like my noble friend Lady Noakes, I do not understand why it was necessary for the Government to convert the foundation shares. In any event, the Government have committed to continue to pay charitable donations from Northern Rock&#151;or they have required the new Northern Rock management to continue to pay, regardless of whether it makes a profit, &#163;15 million in each of the next three years to the Northern Rock Foundation. I rather wonder why. I do not for a moment wish to suggest that the charitable causes in the north-east and in Cumbria which have been supported by the Northern Rock Foundation are not entirely worthy. Indeed, as the former chairman of Northern Rock pointed out in his chairman&#146;s statement in 2006, Northern Rock was the third most charitable FTSE 100 company. But why should the taxpayer, who already makes his own decision about which charities he supports, be bound by that?</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="080311132000015"></a>I can well understand why the former management needed such a potent poison pill to protect itself against takeover, which I understand was the purpose of the establishment of the Northern Rock Foundation and the obligation on the company to pay 5 per cent of pre-tax profits to the foundation, but I do not think that it is right for the taxpayer to bear this additional obligation and burden&#151;insignificant though it is in comparison with the vast liability and obligation which

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="080311132000016"></a>The valuer must of course provide for the public interest to be entirely repaid before the shareholders receive compensation, but I am satisfied that that will be the case. But I ask the Minister to say a little about the Northern Rock Foundation and why&#151;if the foundation is being preserved, and if Northern Rock under government ownership will continue to fund the privatisation although it does not need a poison pill any more&#151;the foundation shares had to be converted to ordinary shares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="080311132000018"></a>In the Explanatory Memorandum, and indeed in the impact assessment, the Treasury has chosen to say, under &#147;Policy Background&#148;:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="080311132000204"></a>&#147;The purpose of the Act is to enable the Government to act to secure the continued stability of the UK financial system&#148;.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="080311132000019"></a>I suggest to the Minister that that was a mistake by the Treasury, because it is over the top. The fact was that a FTSE 100 company with a 7.5 per cent market share chose, at times when people were already issuing plenty of warning signals, to increase its market share to 20 per cent by underselling the market. When the history book is written, it will be shown that Northern Rock&#146;s behaviour was in fact no threat to the financial stability of the UK system. To keep on telling the world that it was is not helping the British economy, the City of London or, indeed, the whole system of financial regulation which applies in this country.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="080311132000020"></a>I am fully aware&#151;the whole House is&#151;of the multiplicity of questions that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, is expected to answer. But even when my noble friend Lady Noakes puts a ball right down the middle of the pitch, maybe with a bit of in-swing on it, heading towards the stumps, the noble Lord kicks it aside. It is true that in Oldham they do not recognise the LBW rule; they cry from the stands, &#147;Give the lad a chance&#148; and carry on with the game. The noble Lord is already facing a huge number of questions. There are 26 Written Questions in last Friday's House of Lords edition of Written Questions. Although none of them goes directly towards the compensation order, there is one tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who is not in his place, to which I shall return later. But before that I should like to try to illustrate one or two of the difficulties of assessing the value of Northern Rock shares.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080311132000021"></a>Article 3 of Part 2 of the order is headed:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a><a name="080311132000206"></a>&#147;Transfer of Northern Rock shares&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000191"></a>and refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="080311132000239"></a>&#147;compensation payable by the Treasury to persons who held shares ... immediately before they were transferred&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1479"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080311132000192"></a>However, at the moment immediately before they were transferred they were suspended but there was an unofficial market in the shares. Between September&#151;reference has been made to September already&#151;and February, five months elapsed during which many changes in shareholding took place. Some of them were no doubt undertaken at the risk of the people who decided to buy. I declare an interest as a trustee of a charity that sold its small holding of Northern Rock shares for somewhere between &#163;2 and &#163;3 in the middle of the five-month period on the ground that it was better to be safe than sorry. So when the assessor reads Article 6(a), which states,</p>
<ul><a name="080311132000240"></a>&#147;unable to continue as a going concern&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000193"></a>he will have to throw his mind back to September because in February Northern Rock was a going concern because the Bank of England had lent it a lot of money. There was no doubt that it was trading and the directors had not issued any statement to the effect that it was not a going concern. So it was only in September last year, on the assumption that the Bank of England did not lend Northern Rock money, that it would not have been at that time a going concern. I rather agree with my noble friend Lady Noakes that it is a pretty open question whether it would have been in administration. Nevertheless, the assessor has to try to determine what was thought by the market to be the value of the shares immediately before transfer when the Bill was already known about. What was the value of the shares back in September according to the assumptions in this order and what about the market in the shares in the five months between the one event and the other? I think that somebody will argue that there was a false market on occasions during those five months.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="080311132000022"></a>As regards the 26 questions, I return to the Question for Written Answer, which is relevant to the order; namely, that of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett,</p>
<ul><a name="080311132000241"></a>&#147;to ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether they will publish the due diligence undertaken on Northern Rock&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000194"></a>I dare say that the noble Lord, Lord Davies, will say, &#147;I shall answer that question when I have to. I do not have to answer it this evening and I am not sure what the answer will be&#148;. However, I believe that the assessor will need to know what was the due diligence done by the Bank of England and the Treasury which led to the decision that the Bank of England would lend money and that the Treasury would guarantee the depositors. I do not see how you bridge the gap between last September and February and the matter of compensation without understanding the work that was done then. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, may also have in mind the due diligence done by Virgin and Goldman Sachs&#146;s reports on due diligence. We have asked before when Parliament will know about the due diligence. Will it ever be published and, if so, when is that likely to be?</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="080311132000023"></a>Finally, I reinforce the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. Exactly how long is this process expected to take with the valuation, the questioning of the valuation and perhaps an appearance before the tribunal and the complications of different jurisdictions, which has already been mentioned? I am sure that Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury will have given the

People are desperate to understand what happened. For me it is straightforward. Had there been any chance of making Northern Rock work, sooner or later a private company would have found a plan that was acceptable to the Government. As regards what was alleged to have happened with Lloyds-TSB, even at the time it was clear to everyone&#151;certainly to me&#151;that it would not have got beyond first base under the EC rules on competitiveness. I do not think that anybody could take that bid seriously.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="080311132000025"></a>It is quite straightforward: the bank collapsed, the Government had to save it and now we are trying to pretend that it had some value independently of the circumstances. What we have seen in the market apart from Northern Rock are hedge funds such as Peloton, worth $3 billion one day and nothing three days later. We have seen what has happened to the Cargill corporation, which borrowed 31 times its assets and is therefore about to go bust. If people do irresponsible things they will go bust, and if shareholders put their money in such companies they do not get anything out of it, whether they are in Hong Kong or elsewhere. If shareholders invest in a company that goes bust, they do not get anything out of it. It is not a case of the UK Government confiscating these assets; they are worth nothing. I hope that my noble friend will put the record straight. It is very difficult for the assessor to say in one day that the value is zero. One has to pretend that this is a rather difficult problem and at least take a couple of days over it. However, there is no great mystery about what the assessor has to do. The sooner that is done, the better.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Desai indicated, we are covering some ground that we have traversed in the not too distant past. I accept entirely the cricketing analogy used by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, with reference to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. She is a specialist in reverse swing. She is able to perplex Ministers, and certainly myself, even when I think I am on secure ground, as I did on this occasion. However, it ill behoves him to upbraid Oldham&#146;s British cricket connections. After all, it produced one of the finest England opening batsmen and captains of recent years, Michael Atherton. All I seek to do is keep bat and pad close together when I am dealing with these issues, not to disregard the rules of the game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="080311132000027"></a>The noble Baroness began by asking about the valuation assumptions in Article 6, and she raised the issue of administration. We make it clear in Article 6 what has been the government position all along on Northern Rock. It is not a going concern, because only public support enabled it to get through the problems of cash-flow difficulties from the summer of  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1481"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last year. The first limb of the statutory objective for administration refers to the possibility of rescuing the company as a going concern. We are clear that the support that was given to Northern Rock, which has kept it going over recent months, has been a reflection of the fact that without that support Northern Rock would have gone into administration.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="080311132000028"></a>I know that the Opposition indicate that that would have been at very limited cost and that it did not necessarily mean a fire sale of the assets. It would certainly mean a far more difficult situation as far as Northern Rock is concerned than the one that we are facing at present because of the judicious action of the Government, after seeing whether the private sector thought that Northern Rock was a going concern. Without going into too much detail about the travails of the past, let us be absolutely clear that as far as Virgin was concerned regarding Northern Rock, there was a huge price to be paid in public support. The public did not get anything back until Northern Rock had made &#163;2.7 billion profit. That was a reflection of the fact that as far as Virgin&#151;a private sector company&#151;committing its resources to Northern Rock was concerned, it did not think that it was viable to do so at that time without this huge underpinning government subsidy.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="080311132000029"></a>I rest my case there. It is quite clear that Northern Rock was not a going concern, and therefore we are asking the valuer to look at the issues against that background. Why against that background? I do not see how any noble Lord can seriously argue that the taxpayer should be underwriting additional value for the shareholders in circumstances where Northern Rock was not a going concern. Of course, the valuer has his job to do regarding the assessment of Northern Rock&#146;s value. I want to reassure the noble Baroness that we will ensure a competition for the appointment of the valuer; I take on board her point that it is a valuable contract and it should be open to competitive tender. We intend that that should be so. Clearly, the valuer has a challenging role to play, and we all recognise that. It is not going to be done in a matter of weeks; it will be a long process. I indicated in my opening statement the rights of shareholders with regard to the valuer and his initial assessment and any potential challenge to that. They have also the right to go to the tribunal if they disagree with the valuer, so their rights are safeguarded in those terms.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="080311132000030"></a>The Government are determined that all shareholders shall be equal with regard to the position of Northern Rock. I have heard the reflections, which were also made in the other place, that certain international treaties will safeguard shareholders based abroad and give them more favourable treatment than other shareholders. First, that is not so. Secondly, in all equity, it ought not to be so. I cannot think of anything being less fair to the ordinary small shareholder. The noble Baroness began her remarks by saying that we should consider the small shareholders first; at least she considered them first in her representation. Nothing could be more offensive to the small shareholder than the idea that someone based abroad would be able to take advantage of bilateral treaties that were designed to&#151;and this has been accurately reflected in discussion  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1482"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>today&#151;safeguard, on the whole, British taxpayers regarding regimes that can act on occasion in an extremely arbitrary and unfair manner. We can all think of illustrations where property has been appropriated without any recognition of obligations to others. For British shareholders, this is not the case as far as the United Kingdom is concerned. We honour our obligations and it will be appreciated that, in honouring them, we will be able to express before any conceivable court the fact that all Northern Rock shareholders are treated equally.</p>

<a name="80311-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080311132000031"></a>There is the particular position of the Northern Rock Foundation, raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard. The foundation is a special case; after all, it is a section of Northern Rock in which there are shares devoted to charitable purposes. If he is saying that the Government ought to have treated that position four-square with every other shareholder in Northern Rock, with no particular respect for the foundation, he indicates scant regard for the value of the Northern Rock Foundation&#146;s charitable role. The Government felt duty-bound to guarantee &#163;15 million a year for three years. This is not a massive sum as a percentage of what the Northern Rock Foundation enjoyed under the best years of the bank, but is nevertheless a figure that it could expect to receive in years of relatively poor activity. The Government would have been open to criticism if they had shown that particular charitable function of Northern Rock no regard whatsoever. The criticism would have been voiced in all parts of the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080311132000032"></a>The issue of Granite has raised its attractive head yet again. I emphasise once again that everyone knows the nature of the category of securitisation vehicle into which Granite falls. Everyone knows that these vehicles exist for other banks and building societies, in order that they should be able to realise value from mortgages more rapidly than they would over the duration of the mortgage period. It is quite clear that the Office for National Statistics regards Granite as being included in the accounts of Northern Rock. That does not mean that it is to be included in the liabilities to the Government, because the Government have not taken Granite into public ownership. They are not responsible for the debts to bond holders, who are the massive majority of shareholders in Granite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080311132000033"></a>Although it appears on the nation&#146;s balance sheet at present, the issue that the noble Baroness has to address&#151;as do her colleagues in the Commons&#151;is not whether Northern Rock appearing on the public accounts together with Granite is an embarrassment to the Government. Let me say that it is a short-term embarrassment to the Government because the Government will resolve this issue in due course. It would be a greater embarrassment if the Opposition had to spell out how the resources&#151;which now, in the national accounts, have to be devoted to Northern Rock on the debit side&#151;would be withdrawn from the Government&#146;s spending side. If the Government are being pressed to take account of Northern Rock in the national accounts in a matter of weeks, and therefore to take out of the Government&#146;s spending pattern the very significant resources and obligations

I am grateful to him for distinguishing effectively between the two. The framework agreement traces how the relationships to Northern Rock will obtain in the future when Northern Rock is at arm&#146;s length from the Government and is responsible for its own business plan. It is the business plan that has to be submitted to Brussels. We recognise that during the passage of the legislation there were constant calls for both the agreement and the business plan to be made public. That will be done all in good time. It is of course necessary that these documents come into the public domain, but it will be appreciated that at present the issues relating to the business plan have to be agreed with Brussels and we have to pass the test with the European Commission. The framework agreement will come into the public domain in the very near future and I cannot be any more precise than that.</p>

I do not understand why he is now using the time-honoured formula &#147;as soon as possible&#148;, which usually means some distance into the future. What is so difficult about publishing the framework agreement, which governs the relationships between government, shareholder, lender and Northern Rock? What is the problem with that?

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080311132000039"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, asked me about other aspects that should be made public. I think he will realise that there is a difference between the framework agreement, the business plan and the arrangement with Goldman Sachs. I have just had confirmed to me 17 March as the date in Brussels. The arrangement with Goldman Sachs was a private arrangement between the Government and the company for some very difficult work to be carried out, and I do not see how the noble Viscount can make out that the details of that need to be in the public domain at present. However, it will be appreciated that the Government believe that every arrangement should at some stage be in the public domain, and of course aspects of the Freedom of Information Act will guarantee that in any case.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="080311132000040"></a>The noble Viscount commented, as did the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, on the process that the Government followed from last September. Of course the Bank of England carried out due diligence when it was proposing to lend &#163;30 billion of the nation&#146;s money, and a very thorough examination was carried out at that time. It will be recognised that since August last year&#151;in fact, some time before that&#151;the Treasury has been involved in intensive work on Northern Rock. I cannot give him the answer that I owe, first, to my noble friend Lord Barnett about how much detail I am able to identify on due diligence. If the House thought that the Government had entered into this enterprise with such significant national resources without being involved in due diligence on the survey of Northern Rock&#146;s condition, that would be greatly underestimating the Government; they will be able to stand that test on any occasion when it presents itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080311132000049"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, government Amendments Nos. 166, 168 and 170 extend the deadline by which the Committee on Climate Change must lay its annual report in the second year after the end of the budgetary period from 30 June to 15 July. It is a small change. Having considered the arguments made by noble Lords in Committee, we agree that there is a case for extending this deadline. At the end of the budget period, the Secretary of State has until 31 May in the second year following the end of the period to lay the Clause 14 report before Parliament. As drafted, Clause 28 would then give the Committee on Climate Change only until 30 June to lay its progress report before Parliament. The Government now accept that that period may be too short and we therefore believe that a short extension of two weeks will ensure that the Committee on Climate Change can take into account the contents of the Secretary of State&#146;s final Clause 14 statement of emissions.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080311132000050"></a>We have opted for a short extension of only two weeks as we should remember that, by this time, there will already be a large amount of information available that the committee can use to make significant progress in preparing the report in advance of 31 May. It will have information on the UK&#146;s emissions and net carbon account for each year of the budget period, based on the annual emissions statements to Parliament under Clause 12. The committee will already have made four annual progress reports of its own, which will have been laid before Parliament, and the Government will have responded to each of them. So the committee will already be well placed to start making its assessment of the way in which the budget for the period was or was not met and of the action taken during the period to reduce emissions. That is why we think that a short, two-week extension is sufficient. It will provide adequate time for the committee to make any final adjustments to its report to take account of the Government&#146;s final statement. It will achieve this without delaying unnecessarily the committee&#146;s report or allowing the report to be laid during the parliamentary Recess.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080311132000051"></a>Amendment No. 167 would extend the deadline for the committee to submit all its Clause 28 reports until 31 August, which seems excessive. For the years one to four of the budget period, the Government will have tabled the Clause 12 emissions statements by 31 March. The Bill as drafted will then give the committee three months to write its Clause 28 report. We are not sure why it would require a further two months&#146; extension to 31 August. We also note that this date falls in the parliamentary Recess, which could complicate matters. The only occasion on which we think an extension is justified is for the progress report at the end of a budget period under Clause 28(2). As I have explained, we think that two weeks are sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080311132000052"></a>Amendment No. 169 would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to extend the period allowed to the committee for laying its annual progress report. The power in Clause 28(4) is included and the reporting dates in the Bill have been chosen to allow the  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1486"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>committee to consider, before making its progress report, emissions data made public by convention and under international and European Union reporting requirements. This power would allow the Secretary of State to make appropriate adjustments to the date if the international reporting requirements were altered. If, for example, that information were to become available later in the year, it might make sense for the committee to be able to delay each report until it has had the opportunity to consider the information.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="080311132000053"></a>The power cannot be used to prevent the committee from reporting earlier if it wished. If the Secretary of State wanted to delay the report but the committee did not want a delay, the committee would still be perfectly able to submit its report whenever it wanted. It simply leaves open the possibility of the committee delaying its report should it wish to do so. Reports must still be made annually. We believe that the flexibility to alter the dates by which the reports are required is an essential part of the Bill, so I hope that noble Lords will not press their amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080311132000072"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the last time we proposed this amendment, it triggered some responses that were supportive and others that were clearly not. Throughout the months of deliberation, a great deal of emphasis has been laid on the need for consensus, and the passage of the Bill so far has largely reflected that position. Our amendment is in exactly that mould. We do not urge or demand; we simply request that the climate change committee advise the authority on the potential for reducing the effects of climate change through the adoption of a daylight saving scheme. Whether or not to explore daylight saving is a matter entirely for the climate change committee.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080311132000073"></a>Since the publication of the Bill last May, there has been increasing concern that the severity of the threat has grown and that targets originally contained in the Bill appear not only daunting but even inadequate to fulfil the objective of radically reducing UK carbon emissions. As David King said only last weekend, the challenge is so great that we are going to need every tool in the bag. We must assume that measures will need to be adopted that will not always be comfortable and that changes to individual lifestyles will inevitably sometimes be very painful.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="080311132000074"></a>The Stern report categorically told us that the sooner we tackle climate change, the cheaper and more effective our action will be. Daylight saving could be just one tool in the bag. By matching daylight hours more closely to waking hours, the use of electricity would be reduced. Use of the most basic model of daylight saving would yield a 2 per cent reduction of electricity consumption. With even more stringent daylight saving schemes, even greater economies could be made. The resultant decrease in carbon emissions could prove invaluable. Add to that equation the possible threat to our energy supply and reducing the use of electricity becomes even more desirable.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080311132000075"></a>We are confident that the climate change committee&#151;the committee of experts that we have discussed&#151;will look at the suggestion contained in the amendment as it sees fit. Having seen the list of members appointed to that committee, we have total confidence in their judgment. They would be in a position to judge the value of daylight saving against the outcome of similar schemes in the USA, Australia and 70 other countries. We are convinced that, given the global concern at the

We could learn from one another.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="080311132000076"></a>There are, of course, traditional objections to a UK daylight saving scheme, all of which are valid to varying degrees. The experiment in the 1960s was abandoned for a variety of reasons; it is oft cited as the prime objection to any scheme. However, that was 40 years ago. Factors that seemed overwhelming then may appear less significant now when judged against the relatively new threat of climate change. Actions taken now can reduce that threat and protect our planet.</p>

<a name="80311-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="080311132000077"></a>Finally, I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to last Friday&#146;s debate in the other place, when Mr Tim Yeo advanced the Energy Saving (Daylight) Bill as a Private Member&#146;s Bill, using evidence, statistics and arguments almost identical to those that we used at the previous stage of this Bill some weeks ago. It is encouraging and reassuring to see such consensus and agreement on this issue. While fully appreciating the reasonable opposition to the amendment&#151;too controversial, too early, or even unnecessary&#151;we would be grateful if the Minister could at least hold the door ajar for what we believe to be a constructive and sensible proposal.

I am not sure that this is proper but perhaps I can put a little conundrum to your Lordships. If you are trying to progress as the crow flies between Carlisle and Edinburgh, do you envisage yourself moving a bit to the east or a bit to the west? That is the sort of question that you put to secondary school students. The answer is that Edinburgh is to the west of Carlisle and the majority of Scotland is to the west of that line. So not only is it further north, but it is further west, which affects the rising and setting times of the sun. Where I live, in winter time, it begins to get light at about 8 o&#146;clock and we are used to getting darkness at about 4.30. We are not terribly keen on the idea of it getting light only at about 9 o&#146;clock in the morning in the winter time.</p>

Their parents will never let them walk to school if it is pitch dark.</p>

The statistics gathered for the experiment between 1968 and 1971 showed a decrease in the number of people killed or seriously injured because of the shift in the clocks, but those statistics are skewed because they do not seem to account for the fact that drink-driving laws had not yet come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="080311132000083"></a>In any case, we do not feel that individual proposals for the reduction of carbon emissions have a place in this framework Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to set up mechanisms to introduce policy that will decrease climate change. Even those who feel that it is a good idea should object to the amendment on the grounds that the Bill should not be too prescriptive on policy to be implemented to stop climate change.</p>

It has been argued before and is of course quite right. That is not the issue. The fact is that the further north you go, the darker it becomes in winter, whether you like it or not. Of course, during the summer, you have the advantage of longer days altogether, both morning and evening. The issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, has put before us is a very good one. I am only too happy to have my name attached to the amendment, as it was before. She has argued the case before extremely cogently and has done so even more this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="080311132000085"></a>All that we are asking for is that this is considered as a matter of energy saving. I am glad to hear that the Conservative Party considers that there are enough powers in the Bill for that to happen; it will be interesting to hear whether the Minister can confirm that. If that is the case, that helps the cause enormously. It is only a matter for consideration, because any achievement of daylight saving would have to be the subject of another, completely separate Bill.</p>

<a name="80311-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="080311132000086"></a>My argument is in connection with energy saving. Most of the Bill has been about other methods of achieving that&#151;carbon sinks and other things&#151;whereas we are talking about saving quite considerable quantities of energy. In the two world wars, such measures were introduced for the obvious reason that we were extremely short of energy at the time and drastic measures had to be introduced. You could say that climate change, as a worldwide issue, is of a similarly disastrous and catastrophic nature. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting what the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, is trying to do. Like her, I would like to think that the Minister will be able to give us some words of comfort about this measure being introduced at some stage in the future.</p>

It went on while daylight went on. Daylight hours had been altered to give the maximum hours for work for the whole country, which in those days included Scotland&#151;if my noble friend will accept that description. So, I was sent to bed at something like 6.30 pm, and like a good little boy I went to bed and I went to sleep. About two hours later, the men came in from work&#151;my bedroom overlooked the farmyard&#151;and they woke me up. It was broad daylight and I thought, &#147;My gosh! I&#146;ve overslept&#148;. I jumped up, got dressed and went downstairs, at which, my appalled parents were astonished and said, &#147;What are you doing here, dear?&#148;. I said, &#147;Well, I thought it was early morning. The chaps are coming in down the yard&#148;. I thought that they were going out to work, but they were not, they were finishing their day&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080311132000089"></a>Behind that silly little tale is a very serious issue, which the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, has raised with her amendment. Although my noble friend the Duke of Montrose has chosen to disagree with her, I am bound to say that this matter, in the present circumstances, needs serious consideration. This is not a national emergency on the scale of World War II, for which I am immensely grateful, but it is an emergency on a global scale that we need to think about seriously. We need to think about everything that can be done to reduce our need for and dependence on artificial energy sources. If we can reduce our energy demand by altering our daylight pattern, it needs serious consideration at the highest level. I hope that that will happen.</p>

I am sure that the noble Baroness will take this on board. Applying these figures, it was found there was an increase in energy consumption. I do not know whether that was through heating offices or whatever, which you certainly need to in Inverness, Wick or Aberdeen because they are not exactly the Costa Brava, even in summer. I think the Minister indicated that the figures were marginally less favourable than might have been suggested by the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, because it can get quite chilly in Scotland. Farmers might be used to it, but office workers and others in administration are not entirely used to it. I have certainly taken on board the noble Baroness&#146;s views.

This is an area where there are a number of mantraps; no doubt I have already fallen down one. Personally, I agree with the noble Baroness; we need a wide armoury of policies and ways to tackle climate change. As we have all said before, the way in which individual citizens live their lives&#151;those small things&#151;can at the end of the day make enough difference to this global issue. The amendment is certainly the right way to do this. We need an objective view of what benefits would be gained, and the climate change committee is the way to have that. You often find that what you intuitively think is the answer is not necessarily always quite so straightforwardly so. I am sure that it will be of benefit, but we might find that other nuances come out to make that policy even more exact and helpful.

It is most unfortunate that debates come again at this time of night&#151;the wrong time of day. I have made my position perfectly clear. At this Dispatch Box, I always speak for the Government unless I speak for myself. I agree with daylight saving as a technique for lots of reasons. However, I have spent the best part of 14 days on my feet in this House trying to stop this House making the climate change committee an executive policy-making committee. I am therefore a little surprised by what I heard earlier. The amendment would amount to that. The only saving grace is that I will not even attempt to use my small speech. I will, however, answer the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, by repeating what I talked about before in the inadequate speech that I delivered. The evidence that I used was the specific Building Research Establishment evidence about buildings; it did not cover the totality of what would happen to society. Last Friday, I do not think the Government could give a view in the other place because the Bill was talked out. I am not wholly

DBERR is the department that leads on this. If there was a lot of pressure on the department from business, you would think that it would be on the case, but it is not because there is not a lot of pressure from business in total.</p>

<a name="80311-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="080311132000095"></a>There is the status quo&#151;do nothing&#151;because there is no pressure to do anything. I can offer only the reality. We are dealing with the Climate Change Bill. As I have said, I have spent all this time arguing that it should not have a policy remit to say how we meet the targets or the budgets that will be set by suggesting other things, such as different forms of power generation. There are all kinds of issues. We are trying to stop that because that is not the role of the Committee on Climate Change. I would be falling into a trap simply because I agree with the policy issue, but that is not the issue. That is not the role of the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="080311132000096"></a>However, on the question about the committee advising on this issue, I would draw the attention of the House and that of the other place to the fact that about the only area of the Bill which would be relevant is Clause 30, &#147;Duty to provide advice or other assistance on request&#148;. The clause states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a><a name="080311132000220"></a>&#147;The Committee must, at the request of a national authority, provide advice, analysis, information or other assistance to the authority in connection with&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000195"></a>a whole series of things. In other words, the committee has the power to consider this issue if asked to do so under Clause 30. I cannot go beyond that. It would not make sense from my point of view to make a long speech on this at this point.</p>

The House will not be surprised that, as a former civil servant, once upon a time I read Machiavelli. I quote him bearing in mind the difficulty that Ministers have in doing unpopular things, which is why I want the committee to be able to take the initiative in raising issues. Machiavelli said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="080311132000226"></a>&#147;There is nothing more hazardous that the Prince may essay than to change the established order of things, for he has for adversaries all those who are disadvantaged who contest the changes like partisans, whilst those who are advantaged maintain silence, lest their advantage be perceived&#148;.</p>

I can think of nowhere where that is more true than in relation to domestic premises and our cars. As I said on the first day of Report, those two between them account for 35 per cent of carbon emissions. They hit everyone&#146;s pocket and it is difficult stuff to go into. It will help the Government if the committee opens up some difficult boxes.

I do not know whether that is true&#151;it has not been put to me by an energy body&#151;but it is in the interests of the Government and us all that the Government should have, through the committee, the information and analysis required to formulate good policy even though they have been reluctant to ask for this box to be opened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="080311132000108"></a>The Minister has said several times that he does not want the committee to be engaged in policy&#151;and certainly not in decision-taking&#151;but if a committee has, as this committee has under Clause 27(1)(a), the duty to advise the Government on energy budgets; and if, as under government Amendment No. 144, it goes into sectors where there are particular opportunities for making savings; and if, as required under the same section of the Bill, it has a duty to give the reasons for its advice, I cannot see how the committee can do that without evaluating the implications, benefits and costs of specific actions. If not, it is an empty box; there is no basis for its advice. It must give that advice to the Government, and we have agreed that it should be made public. If it is not, I guess it will be wheedled out under the Freedom of Information Act. Although the committee is not there to decide, it inevitably presents the Government with considerably worked-out policy options and it will be to the advantage to the Government to have this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="080311132000109"></a>Once upon a time I was invited by the Government of the day to chair a committee on the future of further education. One issue was paramount&#151;how it was to be funded. The place was in uproar about higher education. It is very handy in those circumstances to a Government&#151;and perhaps even to an opposition party when an election is not very far off&#151;to have independent persons, under a chairman of sufficient age that he is wholly expendable, to say the things that are very difficult to say and to present the Government with options for something as challenging as, for example, tuition fees. It is very tempting to leave such difficult issues on one side. Sometimes independent persons, such as the committee which is to be appointed, if given that extra bit of freedom, can tackle those issues, open the box for the Government and make it possible to debate them in public and move forward on policy issues.</p>

The amendment makes the Committee on Climate Change come alive with its own autonomous capacity to make recommendations where it sees fit. This seems to fit in with our overall approach to the Bill, which has been to empower the Committee on Climate Change to ensure that it is robustly independent and authoritative. At first glance, this might be even too far for our liking&#151;that is, the Committee on Climate Change should be an authoritative and independent body but should not usurp the powers of the Government, in terms of the formulation of difficult details of policy or launching its own policy initiatives and agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="080311132000113"></a>The amendment makes the committee much more reasonable. It simply powers the committee to provide information for which it was not asked directly by the Secretary of State. This seems like a very sound idea. What comes immediately to mind would be breakthroughs in the scientific community&#151;or indeed even in industry&#151;which would be very important to the Secretary of State and might affect government policy in an oblique way. The Secretary of State might not be able entirely to appreciate the import of some of the more abstruse breakthroughs and it would be extremely beneficial to put the committee in a position in which it could pass on this information. Although that would not be its primary function, the committee is perfectly poised to be the conduit between the scientific world and the political world. Providing information and advice to the Secretary of State would enable him to make better informed decisions.</p>

<a name="80311-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="080311132000114"></a>We have to face the fact that, on these immensely complex matters, the Secretary of State might not even know when he should ask for advice. This is by no means a condemnation of politicians, but with the immense speed at which developments occur in this field it would be useful to give the committee this capacity to proffer its own advice. The Government would be hard-pressed to object to an amendment like this&#151;it would seem that they would want the committee to be under the thumb of the Secretary of State if they reject it.</p>

<a name="80311-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="080311132000115"></a>It would be interesting to hear further from the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, of situations where he feels that empowering a committee in this way would have strengthened the position of the committees and bodies on which he has served in his long public life. He has proposed a particularly useful amendment this evening.</p>

<a name="080311132000116"></a><b><a name="80311-0015.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="080311132000284"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, for having brought forward the amendment, to which I was pleased to add my name. I was quite surprised when the noble Lord first approached me, because I had assumed that the committee would have this power, yet when one goes through the Bill, one sees that that is not clearly the case.</p>

<a name="80311-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="080311132000117"></a>The amendment is again in the area of executive authority versus advice. In no way does it introduce executive authority for the climate change committee in terms of placing obligations on government, but it legitimises the committee, keeps it intellectually alive, and makes it a much more useful instrument for government in that it gives them the ability, particularly in the areas of analysis and research, to look at

Therefore, the proposed power is very important.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="080311132000118"></a>However, would the amendment lead to the climate change committee, through its own authority, advising government on major policy issues on its own initiative? To my mind, it does not go that far, nor should it. The committee should be able to take on independent analysis around technical and important issues, but it should not use the proposed new clause, for instance, to say, &#147;We believe that nuclear power is the only way to solve climate change&#148;. That is not what the amendment is about; it is around intellectual rigour, around bringing items that are not otherwise evident to the notice of government. Its practical effect would be that the climate change committee became much more alive, and remained fit for purpose and an even greater asset to government in terms of their own policy-making.</p>

I was tempted to go down the road of a former Prime Minister on the issue of tuition fees, who said to me when I visited him, &#147;We&#146;re not going to get anywhere with this. It needs some committee, some Select Committee, some independent committee to come up with it, because if your lot propose it, we&#146;ll oppose it; if we propose it, you&#146;ll oppose it&#148;. That was after I had been dismissed, of course, for making the proposal when I was a shadow spokesman. That works in practice in some ways.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="080311132000120"></a>However, I have good news. Clause 28 requires the climate change committee to lay an annual report on progress before Parliament. The committee has duties to provide advice on the level of carbon budgets, and to carry out a review of the level of the 2050 target before the end of the year. Clause 30, which I have already drawn attention to, contains a further duty to provide advice on request. Clause 31(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a><a name="080311132000227"></a>&#147;The Committee may do anything that appears to it necessary or appropriate for the purpose of, or in connection with, the carrying out of its functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000200"></a>If I was being told, &#147;You&#146;re independent; you&#146;re part of the great and the good; we want you to give robust, independent advice&#148;, and I and colleagues on the committee were minded to say, &#147;Hang on, these powers enable us to do something&#148;, that would seem pretty wide to me. Clause 31(2) only gives some particulars, stating &#147;in particular ... may&#148;, but subsection (1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"></a><a name="080311132000228"></a>&#147;The Committee may do anything that appears to it necessary or appropriate&#148;.</p>

On the particular item, it says that it may provide advice on request; in effect, excluding unrequested advice. If it said that the committee may provide advice, fine, but it says specifically that that advice must be given on request. To that extent the wording of the Bill excludes the possibility of

That is my reading of the Bill and what I think has motivated the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and what certainly motivates me to feel we have to open the thing up a bit.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="080311132000122"></a><b><a name="80311-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="080311132000287"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, unsolicited advice in the sense of what my noble friend was asking for on daylight. I specifically emphasise in Clause 30 that the committee may do these things at the request of a national authority; for example, the Secretary of State or the devolved Administrations. However, when the committee comes to form its budgets, its advice and the targets&#151;because that is its central purpose&#151;it will clearly, as we have debated, commission and look at all kinds of work and research. It is up to the committee; it is not our job to second-guess it. I am not saying in this case that it would necessarily be the case of daylight hours&#151;I have gone past that.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="080311132000123"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, raised a general issue. If the committee wants to do something it thinks is appropriate&#151;in forming its advice to Government&#151;not on policy but advice on the budgets, it is free to use these powers. It is not a free for all&#151;no one is arguing that. It is constrained within its functions, as I have said, for the purpose of carrying out its functions. But its functions to give advice and to set those budgets are pretty widespread. This is an incredibly powerful committee to that extent.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="080311132000124"></a>I am not offering Clauses 30, 31 and 28 as an alternative and we do not need the provisions of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. The things that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, was getting at could well be facilitated by a combination of Clause 28 and Clause 30 maybe. But leave Clause 30 on one side if there is no request. The climate change committee has to be a self-starter and set in its parameters because obviously we do not want to overload it. The Government have requested it to do certain things as a priority. There is the issue of looking at the 60:80 target for a start.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="080311132000125"></a>We need to keep the issue clear and focused. The committee can only do things on request. In other words, it is not completely constrained as to what it can do by every measure and only receiving written requests from a national authority, Secretary of State or the devolved Administrations. If it thinks it necessary, as a result of carrying out its function, to give advice on very wide areas 50, 20 or 10 years ahead, it can do these other things. It is then up to it to say, &#147;That is what we thought was appropriate to use&#148;. That is why general ancillary powers are there. &#147;General&#148; means general; &#147;ancillary&#148; means extra; and &#147;powers&#148; means the powers.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="080311132000126"></a>So it is up to the committee to take cognisance of that. I can see circumstances where it might want to say, &#147;We need to go beyond our function and commission some other work or carry out some other function&#148;. It is not constrained by Clause 31. It can do anything it wants as long as it can link it to its functions. That is a perfectly reasonable response. So there is an opportunity for the committee to express its views on progress in tackling climate change. I do not think there will be any issue. It will be a high-profile committee in terms of media and the public perception, and very powerful in terms of its advice to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="080311132000127"></a>We have discussed the importance of insuring that the committee is adequately resourced to carry out its tasks. We have accepted that. I have already said that&#151;speaking from memory&#151;it should receive the same kind of servicing that the Stern report received. I approved of that. That is what I said originally. It will have the same kind of backup that the noble Lord, Lord Stern, and his team had. That is important.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="080311132000128"></a>At an operational level, the amendment could distract the committee from its key task and could be disproportionate and overburden the committee. It will have dedicated resources but it is not a completely free-for-all. In practical terms, the committee and the Government will have to agree a work programme because of making best use of its resources&#151;and I have no doubt that Parliament will want to scrutinise those. Documents will be made public. Everyone will see what it is focusing its resources on. Its remit is to provide expert advice on the budgets and not to go beyond that. But I will only be repeating myself if I go down the road of making policy options on some of the issues raised.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="080311132000129"></a>I think that in many ways the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, goes too far in the way in which the proposal is set out&#151;though not in relation to what he seeks to achieve: ensuring that the committee has freedom and common sense and that it touches the boundaries and deals with unpopular issues. The Committee on Climate Change will have to offer advice on some very difficult issues, and that might be unpopular. But it will be for the Government to formulate policies to put that advice into operation. The buck rightly stops with the Government, who are accountable to Parliament. We do not want to burden the climate change committee with being the centre of attention in the cockpit where we are discussing the way forward in implementing the budgets and advice it recommends.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="080311132000146"></a>The Minister explained in Committee that accepting the amendment as it was drafted would prevent UK-wide trading schemes as the Secretary of State would not have authority over the schemes in the devolved Administrations. I appreciate that point, and it is certainly not the goal of our amendment. However, we have retabled it because on consideration we still feel that there are some unanswered questions concerning devolution and trading schemes.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="080311132000147"></a>It is rather up in the air as to what will be in the Scottish climate change Bill. I gather that some of the ideas are currently out for consultation. Perhaps the Minister is being kept up to date on whether the basic proposals are on the same lines as we anticipate will be brought in under the carbon-reduction commitment, the one visible policy which would come in under the Bill we are now discussing. So far, I do not believe that the Scottish Administration expect to set up their own climate change committee. Is a good mechanism available whereby the good work that is done by the climate change committee here can be made readily available so that the Scots can evaluate what might be of use to them?</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="080311132000148"></a>We have delved into the issue of national authority several times but there still seem to be remaining concerns. It would be interesting to know whether a trading scheme for the UK could apply all over the UK. Can the Minister give any indication whether this will come about? I suppose that the trading scheme would be beneficial to all parts of the country so there is no obvious reason, at the moment, why there might be disagreement.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="080311132000149"></a>Indeed, the devolved Administrations might be particularly affected, especially if in the future there are mechanisms to create carbon credits by certifying reductions. This means that other sorts of emissions

Interestingly, one of the functions that is not devolved is energy, so feed-in tariffs might have to apply across the whole country. I know it is a slightly different issue but it might cause disagreement about trading scheme regulation in the future.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="080311132000150"></a>Feed-in tariffs, to take one example, might cause disagreement as some evidence suggests that they tend to promote certain types of geographically specific ways of reducing emissions which might favour one nation over another. For example, feed-in tariffs in Germany, together with planning law, tend to favour wind power and cause a concentration of development in the northern coastal states. A similar thing could happen in Scotland with hydroelectricity. If there were the opportunity to have emission reductions certified as tradable credits&#151;an issue I will take up later&#151;the trading schemes regulation becomes intimately linked into all manner of more local regulation and devolved issues.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="080311132000151"></a>The Minister has told the House that the devolved Administrations will be free to set their own schemes but that it might be necessary to have UK-wide regulation for trading schemes. How can we be assured that this will be the case if it is to be determined individually by the national authorities? It seems very open-ended and could lead to possible confusion.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="080311132000152"></a>The Minister said that he previously opposed this amendment because of a lack of sophistication in its drafting. Does he accept its intention? Would he consider bringing something forward at Third Reading to clear up the confusion regarding the direction of the trading schemes regulation? I beg to move.</p>

This amendment would give all the powers to make trading schemes under the Bill to the Secretary of State. He alone would be able to make UK-wide trading schemes using the powers; the powers in Part 3 would not be available to the other national authorities. I understand the intention behind Amendment No. 183&#151;to ensure that a UK-wide approach only can be taken&#151;but we think that it would create real problems in our relationship with the devolved Administrations and that it would not achieve its objectives.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="080311132000154"></a>The idea behind Part 3 is to allow each of the national authorities to make trading schemes within their competence, using the same set of powers, and to be able to work jointly together to do so. It is worth looking at the current position. At the moment, the Secretary of State has no power to make such trading schemes through secondary legislation, nor do the Welsh Ministers. The Scottish Parliament can make trading schemes within its competence in Scotland and the Northern Ireland Assembly can make trading schemes within its competence in Northern Ireland. Our aim is to have the same set of powers available to each of the national authorities without changing or upsetting the devolution settlements that are already in place. The whole idea is to enable joint trading schemes to be made in secondary legislation, which cannot be done at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="080311132000155"></a>If this amendment were agreed to, the Secretary of State would be able to make UK-wide schemes on his own. However, the amendment would not take away any of the powers available to the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly, so they could still introduce their own trading schemes in the areas that have already been devolved to them, which could possibly duplicate or cut across any trading schemes that the Secretary of State introduced under the amendment. It would be just as possible for us to end up with multiple trading schemes in the UK and there would be far greater potential for confusion and complexity. Moreover, any schemes would not be tied together by a single enabling power. I know that the noble Duke does not seek that, but that would be the consequence of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="080311132000156"></a>We also do not think that it is sensible to have several new powers exercisable in the same legislative fields in different UK countries. That would cut across the devolution settlements that were drawn up following the referenda in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. It is not practically sensible, or necessary, for the UK Government to give the appearance, which is what it would be, of clawing back powers in this way.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="080311132000157"></a>We are putting in place firm foundations for joint trading schemes. The national authorities have agreed that this is the most sensible way forward&#151;they agree with the Bill&#151;and we continue to work closely together. For example, the carbon reduction commitment, which I mentioned in the debate on this issue in Committee, will be rolled out across the whole of the UK using these powers. That is a perfect example of how committed the national authorities are to working together within their powers to reduce emissions. Every country understands the desirability of having UK-wide schemes, because a bigger scheme with a wider market will ensure more liquidity and increase the likelihood of delivering more efficient emissions reductions as a result.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="080311132000158"></a>These powers in the Bill offer the best possible way to a solution. While I see where the noble Duke is coming from, I hope that the elaboration that I have given shows that we could end up with more difficulties regarding the devolution settlement and still not get joint emissions trading schemes, when I think that we would all agree that it is those schemes that are sensible.</p>

Having heard him explain in earlier stages how each of the Administrations would be totally independent, I found it rather difficult to see how a common scheme could be engineered. It is rather interesting to hear that the devolved Administrations are all prepared to accept the carbon reduction commitment when it is introduced. Obviously a certain amount of preparatory work has been done, because that is still somewhere down the line. I suppose that there could be a slip before it comes into place, but it is useful to know that the co-operation has been building up. The question that will remain is what will happen when the next scheme comes along. We would be

</ul>
<a name="80311-0016.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="080311132000162"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a probing amendment. I apologise to the House for introducing it on Report. I confess that for the past two or three weeks, both my intestines and my brains have been somewhat addled by something that my doctors call the norovirus. My mental processes have perhaps not been as sharp as they should have been, hence the late arrival of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="080311132000163"></a>This part of the Bill gives the relevant national authorities the power to make provision by regulations for trading schemes relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Of itself that is very worthy, and I have no difficulty with the proposal as it stands. My amendment is designed to put a framework on to that power to ensure that the limits of carbon emissions, on any of the schemes introduced under this part of the Bill, have to parallel the limits of reductions in emissions that are implied by the limits that might be created under Part 1.</p>

<a name="80311-0016.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="080311132000164"></a>There is a very simple reason why I am asking this question. The European Emissions Trading Scheme, which is so often held up as a wonderful example of how a trading scheme should work was, frankly, in its phase 1 persona, a total disaster. The political will to make the scheme effective simply was not there. Phase 1 of the scheme achieved virtually nothing, except to set up a suitable administration. I will give it that benefit. As far as reducing emissions was concerned, no, this was not the way to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="080311132000165"></a>Phase 2 of the scheme may be more effective. It has come into effect. The price of a tonne of carbon emissions has risen to somewhere near what may become a sensible figure. Phase 3 is under negotiation. At this moment I have no confidence in the political willpower of those responsible for this scheme, which&#151;if my memory is correct&#151;we heard earlier this evening is responsible for something like 50 per cent of UK carbon dioxide emissions. I have no confidence that the administrators of this scheme will set limits that will take our emissions down to the sorts of levels implied by the figure that the Government have now put in Part 1 of this Bill, still less the figure that the Committee on Climate Change may well ask the Government to impose when it has had time to consider adequately the development of information on climate change since the original figure was suggested.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="080311132000166"></a>Therefore, we need to look at any scheme introduced under this part of the Bill, to ensure that it has regard to the strategic target which the nation has now set, and which may be amended to an even more severe target. It may well be that the Minister will be able to tell us not to worry, and that this is not an issue because it is implicit in everything the Bill says that the state I want to bring about will happen. If the Minister gets up and tells me that, that will be fine. If he cannot tell me that, we need to be quite concerned. If we are going to establish these schemes, and if they are going to work, they have to take emissions down to the levels implied under Part 1 of the Bill. If they do not, frankly, they are not worth establishing. I hope I do not have to come back to this and that the Minister will be able to give me the assurances that I need. I beg to move.</p>

It is an important point and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on raising it. Clearly, one of the major potential flaws of the independence of the Committee on Climate Change is that all its budgets are already fixed by the emissions trading schemes that are already in operation.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="080311132000168"></a>That is pretty well the case with the EU ETS. The post-2013 proposals have a very precise linear decrease in total carbon dioxide emissions to 21 per cent by 2020. This is in comparison with the 2005 level. Of course, in every other ETS we talk about the 1990 level.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="080311132000201"></a>I should be interested to hear from the Minister what the 2020 reduction is in terms of 1990 levels. I think that it is pretty compatible with the mid-range target, but the Commission is very clear on the matter and I shall read from its questions and answers document:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113"></a><a name="080311132000236"></a>&#147;However, a larger reduction is required of the EU ETS sector because it is cheaper to reduce emissions in the ETS sectors&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080311132000202"></a>In fact, in the non-EU ETS sectors that means a reduction of about 10 per cent compared with 2005 for the sectors not covered by the scheme. That illustrates the sort of difficulties that there are and shows that the degrees of freedom that the Committee on Climate Change will have in agreeing budgets because of EU obligations will be severely limited. Of course, it will be more than 50 per cent&#151;I think that it is currently 52 per cent&#151;because it will include aluminium and phosphates in additional sectors. Therefore, very deep questions arise here.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="080311132000169"></a>I am also interested to hear the Minister&#146;s answer with regard to UK domestic schemes. Will there be a need for any significant scheme, and will carbon budgets and the targets of the Committee on Climate Change be undermined?</p>

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="080311132000170"></a><b><a name="80311-0017.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080311132000297"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, here comes my deep answer to the deep questions. It will probably sound quite shallow to noble Lords opposite, who are much more expert in this than I am.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="080311132000171"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, knows, Amendment No. 183ZA would require each trading scheme, which is set up under Part 3 to limit activities  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1504"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1504</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that cause greenhouse gas emissions, to deliver the same level of reduction as required by the target in Clause 1(1). Our key concern with the amendment is that it would restrict the flexible approach which, as I have often mentioned, is absolutely key to the trading scheme powers. The amendment would essentially introduce sectoral targets by the back door. A trading scheme could be introduced only if it reduced the emissions in 2050 from that sector by at least 60 per cent.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="080311132000172"></a>The 60 per cent target applies to the whole economy. It does not matter where in the economy our emissions are reduced as long as the overall target is met. It will obviously be more cost-effective to reduce emissions in some sectors than in others, so some sectors will achieve more than 60 per cent and others less than 60 per cent. However, the amendment would require that any sector covered by a trading scheme which limited emissions would have to reduce its emissions by at least 60 per cent. We think that this could increase the overall costs for the UK of meeting our target. For that reason, we have rejected rigid, top-down sectoral targets, and we cannot accept the amendment. However, I think that that message had already come across.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="080311132000173"></a>In addition, what would happen if a scheme was introduced in, say, 2010, and we did not know at that time what impact the scheme would have in 2050? Would the amendment mean that the scheme could not be introduced at all? That could lead to the bizarre situation where the Government might not be able to introduce the measures needed to take us towards the target in the Bill, because individually each measure would not deliver a 60 per cent reduction. This would leave us still further from meeting the targets and budgets overall.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="080311132000174"></a>A further practical difficulty concerns the nature and level of the target in Clause 1(1). The Bill contains provision for the target to be revised, but what would be the impact on existing trading schemes if the target was made more stringent? Would the existing schemes have to be adjusted to ensure that they delivered the increased reductions required?</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="080311132000175"></a>We appreciate the sentiment of the amendment, which is to ensure that new trading schemes deliver reductions in line with the long-term target. However, I have outlined the practical difficulties, and the existence of robust scrutiny arrangements, which we have discussed before, will ensure that inappropriate trading schemes may not be brought in using these powers. I hope that that provides sufficient reassurance for the noble Lord and that he will not push his amendment.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="080311132000176"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the amendment covered the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The answer is that the European Commission has recently published proposals for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme to 2020. The EU is committed to demanding emission targets for 2020 and the Commission&#146;s proposals on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are consistent with that. Those proposals will now be debated by the member states in the European Parliament and we hope that agreement can be reached there.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1505"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 1505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80311-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="080311132000177"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked about the EU proposals being consistent with our 2020 target. I am not sure whether I covered this earlier today, but as I have a few minutes left I shall put this on the record. The Government have proposed a target of a 26 to 32 per cent reduction in UK carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 from a 1990 baseline. That equates to a 32 to 37 per cent reduction in emissions of the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases. In addition, the Committee on Climate Change will look at the level of the 2020 target as part of its review of the UK&#146;s longer term 2050 target.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="080311132000178"></a>The Commission&#146;s proposals set out the minimum level of effort that is required of member states for 2020. These proposals do not include whole economy targets for each member state, so it is not possible at this stage to estimate the accuracy of the proposed UK&#146;s contribution to an EU 20 per cent greenhouse gas reduction target. That will become clear once further decisions have been taken on how to divide the EU-wide central cap for the Emissions Trading Scheme. Under the Commission&#146;s proposals that is likely to be in 2011 or 2012. However, on the basis of what the Commission has set out so far, the overall UK share of the EU&#146;s greenhouse gas reduction target of 20 per cent by 2020 will not be above the 2020 target set out in the Climate Change Bill.</p>

<a name="80311-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="080311132000179"></a>Our projections suggest that achieving the target in the Climate Change Bill to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to 26 to 32 per cent&#151;that is the range&#151;below the 1990 levels by 2020 would mean that our total greenhouse gas emissions were about 32 to 37 per cent below 1990 levels in 2020. We are looking at the detail of the Commission&#146;s proposals to see whether we can be more specific. We are able to go further if we choose; we are now working with other member states, the European Parliament and the Commission to ensure that members will be able to identify a single, economy-wide target that applies to them. That would give us the clarity that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, seeks. If he asks me anything else, I do not have any more answers.</p>

I am disappointed because it is always possible for a Government in this situation to give a perfectly logical response saying that the amendment would not work.

<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="080311132000182"></a>When all is said and done, we know perfectly well that we shall have quinquennial carbon budgets, with annual targets and so on beneath. There is no reason why we could not phase a marketing scheme to comply with the quinquennial targets. Of course, that was not in my amendment because I wanted to have the argument. I accept the point that the Minister makes that economies in some areas will be easier to make than in others. Of course, it is entirely reasonable and rational that where those economies can be made, both easily and economically, the attention should be focused. There may be other areas where that will not happen. I entirely accept that.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="080311111000012"></a>On 29 November, I informed the House (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col., <I>WS</I><I></I><I>172</I>) that I had formally commissioned Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Courts Administration (HMICA) to lead a thorough inspection and prepare a report to Ministers into the &#147;resulting&#148; and warrant processes at Leeds magistrates&#146; court.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="080311111000013"></a>I have today placed a copy of that report in the Libraries of both Houses and published it on the Ministry of Justice website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcements110308a.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcements110308a.htm</a>. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="080311111000014"></a>The concerns about Leeds magistrates' court relate to two issues: recording the results of cases within the courts system and subsequently, in the case of recordable offences, updating the police national computer (PNC). &#147;Resulting&#148; is the term used for this within the courts system. The second related issue centres on a process used for withdrawing warrants issued by the court for the arrest of defendants who failed to appear in court, which were identified during investigations into court resulting in Leeds.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="080311111000017"></a>At the time of these failings, these matters were the responsibility of West Yorkshire magistrates&#146; courts committee (MCC).  MCCs were independent local committees, formed almost entirely of magistrates, responsible for the &#147;effective and efficient administration of their courts&#148;. The Government abolished MCCs in April 2005 through the implementation of the Courts Act 2003, following a review of the criminal courts in England and Wales by Sir Robin Auld.</p>

I commissioned the inspectorates to undertake their investigations to ensure that all of the historic issues had been identified and that systems were in place to ensure that any mistakes of the past would not be repeated. HMCS has co-operated fully with the inspection and has assisted them in uncovering the full scale of the historic problems at Leeds.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="080311111000020"></a>These failures led to:</p>
 a large number of adjudications not being recorded accurately at the time, or at all, meaning that the results for these cases may now have been lost;the creation and use of a disk to store cases with missing adjudications (following the introduction of a new computer system); the creation of artificial court registers on four occasions in 2002.  This meant inputting in respect of large batches of cases as: &#147;entered in error&#148;&#151;or &#147;audit cleardown&#148; as an &#147;administrative solution to remove unresulted cases from the court computer system&#148; (page 16 of the inspectorates&#146; report); the manufacturing of fabricated court adjudications on at least one occasion in 2004 involving 12 defendants and 27 offences where legal advisers made up the results by &#147;guessing the result of the case where the true court adjudication could not be traced&#148; (page 17 of the Inspectorates&#146; report); anda situation where a prolific offender could have been sentenced to imprisonment twice for the same offence. Investigations are continuing into whether this meant the offender served additional time in prison. If there has been an error the defendant will be informed.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="080311111000021"></a>The inspectorates conclude that there are now 2,206 defendants currently missing an adjudication, covering 3,260 offences of which 1,568 were recordable on the PNC. The report itself sets out the full number and nature of cases involved and describes a systematic covering up of errors.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="080311111000023"></a>A warrant is an order from a court for an individual to be arrested and brought back to the court, or to be bailed to attend a future court hearing. The warrant system is fundamental to the effective operation of the criminal justice system. In any court area a large number of warrants are issued. Some of these will be quite properly withdrawn (for example, where the defendant gives himself up voluntarily, is imprisoned by another court, has died, or the warrant has proved impossible to execute over a considerable period). </p>

<a name="80311-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="080311111000024"></a>The inspectorates also confirm considerable irregularities in the process for the withdrawal of warrants. This process had been agreed in a protocol between Leeds magistrates&#146; court, the West Yorkshire police and West Yorkshire CPS and was implemented between 2003-04 (see appendix 12). This was uncovered by HMCS in November 2007. Under this protocol, where there were no objections, warrants were to be withdrawn in bulk with no evidence that each case was given proper consideration by the court. This reduced the judicial warrant withdrawal process into an administrative act. This was intended to &#147;get rid of the significant number of outstanding warrants&#148;  (see appendix 12).</p>

<a name="80311-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="080311111000025"></a>This led to warrants being withdrawn in relation to 555 defendants representing 1709 offences. Many of these offences were for low-level matters (for example, minor driving offences).  However, 67 defendants also

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="080311111000027"></a>The inspectorates have also confirmed that there is no evidence of inappropriate warrant withdrawal or failures in the resulting process at Leeds since 2004. However, they have identified weaknesses in the underlying processes at Leeds (in relation to the quality and assurance of in court record). HMCS has already begun to implement these improvements. The inspectorates commend, &#147;the willingness of HM Courts Service to accept responsibility for the failings at Leeds magistrates&#146; court even though they happened before the creation of HMCS in 2005&#148; and the commitment to:  &#147;fully identify and rectify all of the failures learning lessons as appropriate and engaging openly with the process&#148;.<I> </I></p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="080311111000032"></a>The Government have always been clear that prison is and will remain the place for violent and dangerous offenders, whilst there are many less serious offenders for whom community punishments can be more effective penalties than short prison sentences. Such offenders can be required to do unpaid work of real benefit, and provide some payback to the communities they have wronged. They can be subject to tagging, curfews and intensive supervision where appropriate and receive targeted interventions to tackle any drug, alcohol, mental health and offending behaviour requirements. Reoffending rates for offenders subject to community punishments are lower than those for short-sentenced prisoners.  Community punishments can be more cost-effective and can offer more opportunities for rehabilitation than short-term sentences, dealing with the offence and the causes of offending behaviour. We have therefore made very

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="080311111000033"></a>Recently, however there has been an increase in numbers of offenders sentenced to short periods of custody, something which inevitably created pressure on the prison service. I can therefore today announce that the Government are allocating further funds, including &#163;40 million to probation in 2008-09, so that sentencers can be confident that the resources are in place to deliver effective community punishments.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="080311111000034"></a>The funds will be allocated in support of a specific delivery plan by probation areas.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="080311111000037"></a>Ministers underlined their support to the upcoming ESDP mission to Kosovo, including the importance of the EU delivering results on the ground and liaising closely with NATO and the UN. Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), General Sir John McColl, briefed Ministers on Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia-Herzegovina, noting that the security situation remained good and that there was continued progress on in implementing the remaining military tasks under the Dayton agreement. The EU Force (EUFOR) Chad Operational Commander, Lt General Pat Nash briefed Ministers on the security situation in Chad, noting that deployment of EUFOR had resumed following a temporary suspension due to rebel activity.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="080311111000041"></a>I have today deposited in the House Libraries a press release detailing the latest position in relation to school and community playing fields. The position remains a very positive one with 97 per cent of concluded planning applications for 2005-06 representing a net benefit or no change to sporting provision. These figures confirm that the Government are meeting their commitment to protect playing fields. I also want to draw attention to a revision of one aspect of the data from previous years due to the discovery of a technical error which I set out in the press notice (also available online at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>).</p>

And the figures collated by Sport England and released today show that our tough protections are working. They reveal that there were no complete losses of playing fields in 2005-06 without replacement provision or net benefit to sporting provision where Sport England has objected to a planning application and where planning permission has been granted against their advice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="080311111000046"></a>It is of significant concern that on average 55 per cent of people entering prison have a serious drug misuse problem, with this figure rising to 80 per cent in some instances. Many have offended to fund their need for drugs. Inevitably, their desire for illicit drugs does not simply disappear when they enter prison. As a result, the Prison Service faces major challenges in trying to respond to prisoners&#146; attempts to secure access to illicit drugs. The Prison Service has a range of measures in place to tackle this issue&#151;ranging from the searching of visitors to work with the police to identify criminal networks intent on supply drugs into particular prisons.</p>

After this the arrangements had to be determined by 15 April and then published within two weeks to allow any objections to be lodged with the schools adjudicator. The period for objections was six weeks long and expired in June 2007.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="080311111000066"></a>All admission authorities should by now have completed consultation on their proposed admission arrangements for September 2009 and must determine their arrangements by 15 April 2008. Local authorities have a duty under the code to refer objections to the schools adjudicator and I expect them to act where it appears that determined admission arrangements do not comply with the statutory requirements.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="080311111000067"></a>Other admission authorities, admissions forums and parents also have the power to object, and from this year religious authorities also have the power to object to the admission arrangements of schools for which they are responsible. The major faith bodies welcomed the code, and I know that they want to play their part in ensuring all schools adopt arrangements that are transparent and fair.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="080311111000068"></a>We will now take the following steps:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="080311111000069"></a><I>Strengthening the role of local authorities</I></p>
It is right and in keeping with their responsibility as commissioners of children&#146;s services that local authorities have oversight of admission policies in their areas. We will introduce an amendment to the Education and Skills Bill at Report stage to place a further duty on local authorities to report each year on the legality, fairness and effectiveness of all school admission arrangements in their area. The report will be sent to the adjudicator after the admission arrangements have been determined and before the end of the proposed new statutory objections period. This will ensure that admission forums and parents are properly informed and the schools adjudicator has the information he needs to investigate and ensure compliance with the code.<I>Improving Admission Forums</I>Admission forums have a vital role in monitoring admission arrangements. We will consult in the coming months on what further steps we can take to ensure that forums operate as effectively as possible.<I>Consulting and engaging communities and parents more effectively</I>Admission arrangements should be subject to proper scrutiny and discussion at local level while they are being determined. This should include an effective consultation that includes all those who have an interest in admission policies, especially parents, and when major changes are proposed. We

This will set out what parents can expect from the admissions system; give them information on how to object to admission arrangements that appear not to comply with the law; and signpost them to information and support when applying for schools. The guide will also outline the admission appeals process.<I>Extending the role of the Schools Adjudicator</I>To ensure that parents and local authorities have sufficient time to check proposed arrangements and to refer an objection we will urgently seek to amend regulations to extend the period in which objections may be referred from six weeks to 16 weeks starting from this year 2008. I am also asking the schools adjudicator to report to me on steps he is taking to ensure compliance with the statutory requirements in respect of 2009 admission arrangements and annually thereafter.

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="080311111000071"></a>There are some important steps we can take now affecting the 2008 admissions across the country.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="080311111000072"></a>For any school that is imposing financial obligations on parents I want to be clear that this practice must stop immediately. Parents must not be required to pay any contribution to the school as a condition of admission whatever they may have agreed to do when making their application. Any school that has asked parents to make a financial contribution as a condition of admission must make clear to those parents now that such a payment is not mandatory.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="080311111000073"></a>I also expect all local authorities immediately to ensure that the most vulnerable children, those in care or with statements of SEN are placed in the most appropriate school as required by law, whatever admissions criteria may have been used.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="080311111000074"></a>The evidence we have collected and are now verifying suggests that the large majority of schools are complying with the code this year. I want to ensure that every school complies with the code in 2009. The measures I have announced today will help ensure that every parent has a fair chance of getting their child a place at a school of their choice, and that no parent or child will be disadvantaged by unfair admission arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="080311111000076"></a>The Information as to Provision of Education (England) Regulations 2008, which were laid before Parliament on 15 January, committed the Government  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS136"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column WS136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the first time to publishing data, local authority by local authority, on how many families received an offer of a place at one of their preferred schools. This Statement fulfils that commitment. On Monday 3 March, which was national offer day, nearly 570,000 families found out where their children will start secondary school this September.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="080311111000077"></a>Today we are publishing data, showing that across the country 81.6 per cent of families received an offer at their first preference school, 8.9 per cent were offered a place at their second preference school and 93.9 per cent were offered a place at one of their three preferred schools. These figures are based on returns from 138 out of 149 local authorities. In addition, we are publishing unverified data from a further 11 local authorities and, once verified, we will publish further updates to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="080311111000078"></a>The new school admissions code prohibits the oversubscription criterion known as &#147;first preference first&#148;, where schools gave higher priority to those who put them down as their first preference. For many parents this effectively meant that only their first preference mattered, and if they did not gain a place at their first preference school they risked wasting their other preferences.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="080311111000079"></a>Now this practice is no longer part of the admissions process, and parents are no longer deterred from expressing their true preferences we might have expected the proportion of first preferences offered to reduce. However, comparing data collected this year with the results of a survey conducted last year, the proportion of families gaining a place at their first preference school has remained broadly the same and, furthermore, there has been an improvement in the numbers of families obtaining an offer at one of their preferred schools.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="080311111000080"></a>There is considerable variation nationally. In the majority of local authority areas, more than 80 per cent of parents have been offered a place in their first preference school. By way of contrast 64 per cent of parents in Greater London have been offered a place at their first preference school.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="080311111000081"></a>Where parents do not receive an offer of a place at their first preference school, this does not necessarily mean that they are dissatisfied with their second or third preference. Recent research by Sheffield Hallam University revealed that where a child secured a place at their first preference school, 95 per cent of parents were satisfied and where they did not, 82 per cent were satisfied.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="080311111000082"></a>We are concerned about the small percentage of parents without an offer corresponding to any preference. We expect local authorities to analyse the reasons for this and to work with families, schools and, where appropriate, their neighbouring authorities to ensure that all parents are able to express meaningful preferences.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="080311111000083"></a>We cannot guarantee that every parent will be offered a place in their first preference school. Nevertheless, because of the huge strides we have taken in improving secondary schools, many more families find themselves in the position of being able to choose from a number of good schools for their children. Our first priority is to ensure that all schools are good schools.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS137"></a><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column WS137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="080311111000084"></a>Making a reality of choice for all families means creating more good schools and refusing to accept low standards. Today, there are far more good schools than in 1997 and standards have gone up across the board. There are now 891 secondary schools where 70 per cent or more children gain five A*-C GCSEs, compared to 83 in 1997. We are enabling the best schools to export their formula for success and support their local communities by partnering other schools in their area, sponsoring academies, or forming trusts. Our aim is to ensure that there are good school places across the country and in the right places for parents to choose from.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="080311111000085"></a>Ten years ago, a child had a 50:50 chance of going to a low-performing secondary school which was unacceptable. Since then, the number of schools with under 25 per cent of pupils with five good GCSEs has dropped from 616 to 17. Furthermore, we have announced the national challenge to lift all 638 schools not achieving 30 per cent five A*-Cs at GCSE including English and maths above that threshold by 2012. Options for schools include becoming an academy, joining a trust, federating with a high performing school or receiving intensive support from experienced headteachers.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="080311111000086"></a>Parents have the right of appeal against any application that has been turned down; and, over the summer, local authorities and schools will be re-allocating places that become available where others have moved address or chosen a different education for their children. We are also working to ensure that the admission process is fair and transparent for all parents and children.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="080311111000089"></a>First, to strengthen effective police co-ordination at a strategic level I am announcing that chief constable Roger Baker of Essex Police will join the UKBA board with immediate effect.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="080311111000090"></a>Secondly, to add to the 3,000 police permanently based at our borders, 39 new specialist posts at ports will be funded in 2008-09 to increase Special Branch coverage where it is most needed.</p>

<a name="80311-wms0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="080311111000091"></a>Thirdly, we will publish in April a new framework for inter-agency co-operation at the border. This can progress more quickly than further structural change either within the police service themselves or between the police and the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="080311111000092"></a>Fourthly, I can confirm that we will seek a new legislative basis and new powers for the UKBA as part of our Immigration Bill in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="080311111000093"></a>Fifthly, the Government will be discussing with police forces and authorities whether change is necessary in the current regime for special funding of Special Branch posts at ports and airports with a view to implementing a new regime from 2009-10. The Government are also considering how to implement the conclusions of the independent report into airport policing, with the aim of clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the police, airport operators and other agencies to deliver a high level of security at UK airports and we will set out proposals on this later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="080311111000095"></a>The Home Office will also be discussing with the Scottish devolved Administration and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland ways of strengthening working relationships between the Scottish police service and the new agency taking into account the devolved nature of policing in Scotland.</p>

<a name="80311w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="080311113000025"></a>Under the Childcare Act 2006, from April 2008 all local authorities in England and Wales are required to take reasonable steps to secure sufficient childcare to meet the needs of working parents. In doing so, they must have particular regard to the needs of lower-income working families. In determining an appropriate level of supply in their areas, local authorities will liaise with local Jobcentre Plus management to assess projected levels of demand from parents moving from welfare into work and to ascertain any specific requirements our customers have. The reforms announced in <I>Ready for Work</I> apply only to lone parents with school-aged children. In England, the aim is that all schools will offer extended school services by 2010, including for school holiday periods.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="080311113000026"></a>The provisions of the Childcare Act do not extend to Scotland. However, the devolved Administration has a stated objective of improving the availability of childcare for working parents and has invested significantly in this area in recent years. Following discussions, officials in the Scottish Executive have indicated that the projected levels of increased demand for childcare in Scotland resulting from these regulations can easily be absorbed by current provision.</p>

These permit blue lights to be fitted to emergency vehicles, including vehicles used for police purposes. The aim is to prevent excessive use, as this could diminish the impact of the lights. Use of the lights is not mandatory but they may be used at emergency scenes, to indicate urgency when on the way to such scenes, or to warn others of the presence of the vehicle or a hazard on the road.</p>

Subject to the regulations and any guidance from those services, drivers of emergency vehicles are expected to use their professional judgment to decide when and where the use of sirens and blue lights is appropriate. Drivers ought to be fully aware that sirens must be used with restraint, particularly at night, so as not to cause a nuisance to residents or other road users. There will, however, always be occasions when it is necessary for the emergency services to use sirens and/or blue lights in the interests of road safety and the protection of the public.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_15"></a>Further to the Written Answer by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, Mr Tom Harris, on 15 January (<I>Official Report</I>, 1090W), why carbon dioxide emissions from heavy goods vehicles have risen from 817 kilotonnes per billion kilometres in 1991 to 920 in 2005; what are the equivalent figures per billion tonne/kilometres of goods carried; and what steps they are taking to ensure that carbon emissions from heavy goods vehicles will be reduced.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a><a name="080311113000085"></a>The variation in tonnes of CO2 per billion vehicle kilometres between 1990 and 2005 in the previous answer is a result of changes to the composition of the vehicle fleet and increases in the amount of goods carried.  Changes in European standards on emission limits for wider air quality benefits may also have resulted in small increases in fuel consumption. Increasing the load on a vehicle will increase its fuel consumption and resultant CO2 emission, but the overall effect is to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of CO2 emitted per tonne kilometre travelled.</p>

This is because registered landfill site operators pay the tax to HM Revenue and Customs and pass on the cost to their customers through the disposal charges they set. The origin of the landfilled waste is not recorded on the tax return.</p>
