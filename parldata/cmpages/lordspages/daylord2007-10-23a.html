Does the Minister agree that it is in the nature of many NGOs to operate in places where the FCO, important though its advice is, would strongly advise them not to go?

This has been a problem for all international NGOs working in Russia, particularly in the areas of human rights and democracy building. Many of them have seen new restraint on their action and new law that she is well aware of, all of which is making their position increasingly difficult. We, like they, are fighting to preserve freedoms in Russia, particularly the freedom for international and Russian civil society to operate openly and to contribute to the political debate in that country.</p>

There is no doubt that when attacks on NGO workers occur, increasingly it is because people know perfectly well that they are humanitarian workers, and that, sadly in the modern world, has made them a political target rather than something to be protected because of their neutrality.</p>

For the senior Civil Service the retirement age is 65. That is in line with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations default retirement age.

The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will review all these issues in 2011 and the whole of the Civil Service will come within the framework at that stage. As he will recognise, however, it is important for the authorities to be able to retain control over employment policy for those in senior Civil Service positions.

Does the Minister agree that it is always difficult to debate these matters with the Conservative Opposition when they never make detailed proposals other than with regard to inheritance tax?

Is it not the case that we can all now recognise that the size of the increases in house prices in the United Kingdom in the past 10 years&#151;in all but the short term for some people&#151;has been bad for the economy, bad for the efficiency of the housing market and particularly bad for those who have suffered from it, especially young and less affluent people who have not been able to afford to buy houses? Is the Minister aware of the comments made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, which were reported in the press last Thursday?

They produce very significant assets for families&#151;and it should be recognised that family assets are 72 per cent above what they were in 1997 when this Government came to office&#151;and therefore give householders the confidence with which to carry out their economic activity. The noble Lord will also recognise the high levels of employment that have obtained over that 10-year period. But of course he is right that we should be concerned about the affordability of housing, particularly for first-time buyers. That is why the Government are tackling the issue on both fronts, in the supply of housing by seeking to produce 46,000 extra houses per year under our new proposals, and by giving what assistance we

Does he also agree that that in itself is unlikely to be sufficient? The wall of money that has come in through the buy-to-let scheme, now running at over &#163;100 billion&#151;lenders such as Northern Rock have been prominent in this&#151;has inflated house prices and pushed out first-time buyers in a way that we have not seen for a long time.

That is backed up, of course, by the fact that the Financial Services Authority is very concerned to identify where lending has been extravagant and unjustified and is seeking to bring pressure to bear on those who verge on the reckless.

But even in this period of relative difficulty, house repossessions are less than half what they were in 1990. There is no indication that we are anywhere near a 15 per cent interest rate or high repossession rate. Therefore, the circumstances that led to the housing crash that occurred under the previous Administration in the late 1980s do not obtain today.</p>

There can only be one price for the housing market and that is the current price. It is essential that there should be no panic. It may very well be that mortgagees are lending over and above 100 per cent of the real value but, nevertheless, one should keep a sense of proportion, because the market can bear those strains. Ultimately, demand will settle the level of price, and demand remains very high.</p>

At the present time, as the noble Lord indicated in a previous question, the demand of first-time buyers for housing needs to be met, because we recognise that our fellow citizens are facing difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="07102342000069"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Clause 16 empowers the Secretary of State and his officials at the Border and Immigration Agency to impose residence and reporting conditions on any person whatever granted leave to enter or remain in the UK unless that grant is for an indefinite period. Those who could be subjected to these conditions in theory include refugees, international students, work permit holders, highly-skilled migrants, tourists and other visitors, and family members of those who are already settled here.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="07102342000070"></a>Although none of these groups has been identified as a target, the potential was expressly conceded by the Government in Committee when the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office said,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000364"></a>&#147;we have not named students with limited leave as one of the categories that we will apply the provisions to at this stage. However, the power is broad and we do not deny that these measures could cover anybody with limited leave&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, UK Borders Bill Committee, 13/3/07;  col. 302.]</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07102342000071"></a>So hundreds of thousands of immigrants therefore face the possibility that they may be required to report monthly, weekly or even daily to an immigration officer, to reside at a specified address or to be present at that place of residence at particular times. This follows from the drafting of the clause, which leaves the purpose for and the circumstances in which the conditions may be set wholly at large. Such conditions might be highly intrusive with the potential to disrupt studies, work and other economic activity, and ordinary family and private life.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07102342000072"></a>As drafted, the clause does not explain what its true purpose is or why, if the limitations on its use in practice are to be those that were outlined by the Minister in Grand Committee, they could not have

We know that the intention is to apply the conditions&#151;initially, at any rate&#151;to UASC and foreign prisoners, though not those covered by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill now in another place. Since the clause is far wider than that, however, there has to be accountability if and when it is used for other categories of person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07102342000073"></a>That is the immediate thrust of the amendment, but it also allows us to remind the Minister of the assurance he gave at the end of the debate on a previous amendment on conditions on 12 July in Grand Committee. He promised &#147;something comprehensive&#148; and said that the department,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07102342000074"></a>Noble Lords who are interested in children will remember that there was a consultation in progress on the Government&#146;s planning for better outcomes and support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children under which it was proposed that these children should be concentrated in 40 to 50 local authorities, with responsibility each for about 100 children, in four regions that were outside London and the south-east, where they are concentrated at the moment. However, in the Minister&#146;s letter to me of 19 July following that session of Grand Committee, although he gave me a lot of information about the numbers of UASC and the need for better management of contact with them&#151;and we hope the letter was useful to some of the agencies with which we shared it&#151;he did not mention the specialist authorities. It was not until 18 September that he wrote again to say that the responses to the consultation, which were originally planned to be published at the end of August, had been delayed so that the Government could announce their decisions arising out of the consultation at the same time. The target date is now the end of November, which effectively prevents your Lordships from making any contribution, as we could otherwise have done to the debate on the treatment of UASC if the original timetable had not been scrapped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07102342000075"></a>At what point was the decision referred to in the letter of 19 July taken? It must have been before the end of August, so why were noble Lords not informed until three weeks later? Does the Minister not agree that his undertaking to provide feedback from the LGA on the specialist authorities idea&#151;given in Grand Committee and therefore, I hope, equivalent to an undertaking given on the Floor of the House&#151;should have been honoured irrespective of what was decided about the rest of the answers to the consultation? When a Minister says he will produce something in any debate and the information is available, does he have the right to delay the publication for three months on the grounds that he wants it to appear simultaneously with something else? As the Minister knows, we are sympathetic to the concept of the specialist authorities, and we can see that paragraph (v) will be necessary to make it work. That is why our amendment asks only for written reasons to be given for the reporting, not the residence, condition. If all the UASC were concentrated in the 40 to 50 authorities, contact

The subject matter of this clause enables me to mention the subject matter of exceptional leave to remain. This used to be a large category of decisions in asylum cases but in recent years it has been squeezed almost out of existence. I say that having in mind that many applicants probably do not deserve full refugee status. On the other hand they have a serious need for humanitarian protection; for example, because it will be impossible for them to return to their own country, or if not impossible, highly risky and dangerous, so I urge the Government to do whatever they can to make greater use of exceptional leave to remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07102342000079"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, tried to flush out more of the purpose of Clause 16. It is designed to allow the Border and Immigration Agency to monitor and maintain contact with certain individuals who have been granted limited leave to remain. That is its primary purpose. As I explained to noble Lords previously, we will grant leave with reporting conditions only where this is justified by a need for close monitoring of an individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07102342000080"></a>We want to be able to apply the clause to former foreign national prisoners, who have been released from prison but who cannot be removed at present due to legal barriers.

There is a clear need there.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07102342000082"></a>Conditional leave may also be used to monitor young people given limited leave other than with their parent or legal guardian, who have not identified themselves to the welfare, health and education agencies but with whom we have reasons for wanting to stay in touch until we are satisfied that the child is being cared for properly. The provisions may also be used to monitor those young persons who have been in the care of local authorities but have since opted out of that care. Again, there are good reasons. I should like to reassure noble Lords that we would only apply the conditions reasonably. Our general duties in public law require us to use all our powers rationally and reasonably.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07102342000083"></a>I have concerns regarding the amendment, particularly in relation to ensuring consistency with the way we currently manage foreign nationals with leave who are placed on similar conditions. There is no general legal duty to provide detailed written reasons in respect of decisions to impose the existing conditions on leave under Section 3(1) (c) of the 1971 Act. To introduce a new duty in these circumstances runs counter to existing practice. It is not necessary and could prove disproportionate.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07102342000084"></a>We would set out in correspondence to the applicant the general principles which are applied when considering whether to place these conditions on leave.  Separately, the specific reporting arrangements that are put in place for an individual placed on conditional leave will be looked at on a case-by-case basis. For example, in the case of reporting arrangements involving a former unaccompanied asylum seeking child who was in care we would consider the resource implications to any local authority. We would aim to keep face-to-face reporting to a minimum and would use telephone or video contact where possible and practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07102342000085"></a>In addition, we will continue our discussions on this issue with the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services during the implementation of this provision, and ensure that its views on frequency and the nature of reporting are taken into account when drawing up advice to BIA caseworkers on handling former unaccompanied asylum seeking children. I believe that those are good reasons for adopting the approach that we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07102342000086"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked about the greater use of exceptional leave. Exceptional leave has now been replaced by humanitarian leave and discretionary leave, which are much more widely used. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked when this decision was made. I shall have to write to him because I do not have that information today and would like to give the matter further thought. I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s patience, but we try to ensure that we give timely responses, and give proper and appropriate advice on the development of policy. I apologise to the noble Lord for that.</p>

At least, any person required to report to an immigration office under new Section 3(1)(c)(iv) of the Immigration Act 1971 would know the general background which led to this condition being imposed.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07102342000088"></a>However, I am disappointed that the noble Lord could not say more in response to my request for information, which he had previously undertaken to give us, on the attitude of the LGA to the specialist authorities. That is critical to the residence conditions. If the 6,000-odd UASC are to be concentrated in 40 to 50 local authorities in specified regions outside London and the south-east, it would mean a major reform to the system. When UASC arrive, presumably, as we did with adult asylum seekers under the NASS system, they would be directed to a particular locality where the authority had spare capacity and is experienced in dealing with this group of young people. It is perfectly reasonable for there to be residency conditions for all UASC. When they reach their destination they will normally be in the care of the local authority and the local authority will have the prime responsibility for seeing that they remain in the accommodation provided for them, be it local authority accommodation or a foster home. They will break those responsibilities if they are not fully aware of the location of the children at any moment, and should have first knowledge of any child who absconds or, for one reason or another, is not residing in the place allocated to him.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07102342000089"></a>We still consider that the prime duty should be laid on the local authorities, and that they are perfectly capable of telling the BIA when there is any breach of the residence conditions. We accept that close contact with UASC needs to be maintained for all the reasons given by the noble Lord. We have never opposed that project. We asked repeatedly for more information about how it was to operate; we are still waiting for that information. Obviously, I have to withdraw the amendment at this stage, but I regret that during this Bill we have not been able to have the thorough discussion that would have arisen if the original timetable had been adhered to, and responses to the consultation published on 30 August. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

He spoke of reviewing the guidance to staff. Amendment No. 2 gives him the opportunity to honour his words. It has the incidental merit of enshrining this year&#146;s High Court decision of Mr Justice Wyn Williams in case CO/9745/2005.</p>

<a name="71023-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07102342000093"></a>The amendment also removes the worrying doubt about whether the assurances given by Ministers in both Houses over a long period have any meaning at all. We have all been repeatedly told that vulnerable people would not be detained, other than in the most exceptional circumstances. In practice, we find that it happens all too often without the least apology, let alone compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07102342000094"></a>Finally, my amendment removes doubt as to whether this country is complying with the relevant EU directive. Noble Lords will note that the directive lays down minimum European standards for the decent treatment of vulnerable people. My advice is that Britain has not opted out or derogated from this directive. I concede that it is likely that this amendment does not cover asylum applicants who have been rejected, or who have exhausted all rights to appeal. I am happy, however, that it protects bona fide applicants and those in the process of determination. We all agree that vulnerable people should not be detained, and that debatable cases should be verified at the earliest possible moment.</p>

Sadly, we know that some economic migrants claim torture, but the tragic reality is that there are people who have undergone the most terrible types of torture, have suffered things that the rest of us are unable to imagine are possible, have suffered rape, are left extremely vulnerable and are broken. Many do not even make it to our country; they die in their place of origin or en route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07102342000097"></a>This country has a long history of taking in those people who have been broken elsewhere by the cruelty and inhumanity of others. The amendment seeks to impose a minimum standard of how we manage people who have already been broken, so that we do not break them further and break the last bit of humanity left in them. For that reason, I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment. The European Community has made a stand, and we should reinforce it in the Bill.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_988"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 988</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>26, which we debated on Report. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that we are attempting to comply with Article 17; unfortunately lapses occur from time to time, which the BIA is doing its best to address. I take it that is government policy, and we need an assurance from the Minister that that is what they are trying to do. If that is the case, there is no reason why the Minister should object to including those words in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07102342000099"></a>I concede, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has just done, that not everyone who claims to be a torture victim or to have some other vulnerable characteristic, such as pregnancy, should be released solely on the basis of that claim. In the case of torture victims, there is a recognised procedure for notifying the caseholder of an allegation by letter under Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules. I have already expressed our thanks to the Minister for his letter of 9 October, in which he said that a central log of those letters has to be kept at every IRC, and that BIA staff have been reminded to acknowledge the letters and to take them into account in deciding whether detention should be maintained.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07102342000100"></a>On Report, the Minister referred to &#147;agency staff&#148;, but it would be preferable for the duty to be laid on a specific individual who is responsible for that asylum seeker all the way through the process. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on that point&#151;that we do not lay the duty on the BIA as a whole but on the specific caseholder. On Report, the Minister said that the caseholder was required to acknowledge receipt of the Rule 35 letter and to do so promptly. He then added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07102342000347"></a>&#147;It may be that the response to the doctor should go beyond a simple acknowledgement. The agency will look at the current guidance to see what more could be said, subject to any issue of confidentiality. For example, the response could indicate to the doctor whether the information about the claim of torture is already known to the BIA and has been considered or whether it is being considered as part of the individual&#146;s asylum application&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/10/07; col. 358.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="71023-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07102342000101"></a>Of course, it ought not to be considered solely as part of the asylum application, because there is a specific duty to consider whether continued detention is justified in the case of torture victims, quite apart from the examination of the asylum claim itself.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07102342000102"></a>The caseholder is the official who will recommend whether the person is to be released or is to continue to be detained; alternatively, he may decide that there is insufficient information in the Rule 35 letter to enable him to reach a decision. The Medical Foundation comment on the Yarl&#146;s Wood inquiry report at the beginning of the month accused the Home Office of failing to act when told that a detainee had a history of torture, and it is with that in mind that I asked the BIA to go further than a simple acknowledgement. Perhaps the solution would be to invite an independent person such as Stephen Shaw to carry out a quick audit of the procedures, to see whether the review mentioned by the Minister had adequately addressed the criticism made by the chief inspector, who gets to examine particular IRCs only every few years. Her most recent report on Yarl&#146;s Wood was over 18 months ago, so the situation may well have improved; I hope that it has.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71023-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07102342000103"></a>However, the fact that, apart from torture survivors, other vulnerable people such as mothers with small babies are still being detained there is a cause for concern. The Rule 35 procedure should be extended to other categories of vulnerable people mentioned in Article 17, and responses should be similarly required from the caseholder. Since the doctor has to examine every person who comes into the IRC, it should not create much of an additional burden for either the doctor or the caseholder, particularly if, as we assume, the individual&#146;s vulnerability has already been considered by the caseholder before the decision to detain was made.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07102342000104"></a>The inquiry into procedures at Yarl&#146;s Wood highlighted the IND&#146;s failure to act when told of allegations of torture, a criticism that the Medical Foundation had been levelling at the Home Office for many months. The last report by the chief inspector, who had been the first to draw attention to the problem, related to February 2006. I would be grateful if the review that the noble Lord mentioned following that report could be placed in the Library of the House. I personally have not seen it, although maybe I have not done my homework properly.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07102342000105"></a>Unfortunately, many vulnerable people are still being detained, such as mothers with small children, for whom Yarl&#146;s Wood is a totally unsuitable environment. If the Minister wants first-hand evidence of that statement, from the Black Women&#146;s Rape Action Project and other women&#146;s organisations that gave stark evidence at a packed meeting in Committee Room 13 a few weeks ago, I would be ready to let him have it. My suggestion is that the Rule 35 procedure be extended from torture survivors to all other categories of vulnerable people. I hope that the Minister will consider that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07102342000107"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on the Immigration Service&#146;s proper compliance with Article 17. There are clearly a number of things to do with that article, one being how it defines &#147;vulnerable people&#148;. Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on that. Although people who have suffered torture certainly form one aspect, and pregnant people are another, a whole host of people could be described as vulnerable. It would be interesting to know how many categories fall under that definition.</p>

On the one hand, under the procedures laid down it is necessary that people coming into the asylum system&#151;in particular, those coming into detention&#151;should have the opportunity for the most careful medical examination, if they are vulnerable in any way; on the other hand, there is the experience that that is not happening in a significant number of cases. From what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has read out, my understanding is that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, would contribute at that point.</p>

He was right to remind your Lordships&#146; House that, as I said earlier, we are trying to ensure that we close the gap between our stated policy objectives and where we end up in practice, because it is practice that we are trying to affect.

Article 17 applies only to those persons found to have special needs after an individual evaluation of their case has been completed. The relevant regulation does not require the Secretary of State to carry out, or arrange for, an evaluation of a vulnerable person to determine his special needs.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07102342000320"></a>To return to the specific question of detention, it is already the case that those persons defined as &#147;vulnerable&#148; by the reception directive and the 2005 regulations are subject to particular guidance in relation to whether or not they should be detained. They are already subject to that guidance, which makes it clear either that such persons should not be detained&#151;unaccompanied minors, for example&#151;or that the reason for their inclusion among those defined as &#147;vulnerable&#148; should be a factor arguing against detention, with a requirement that all factors arguing both for and against detention are considered. The latter position would, for example, apply to individuals with a history of torture.</p>

<a name="71023-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07102342000321"></a>Where it is decided that such individuals should be detained, their special needs are identified at the point of initial detention&#151;or as soon as they become known thereafter&#151;and are communicated to those responsible for their custody so that appropriate arrangements for their care may be put in place. For example, in the case of pregnant women, this would include access to midwives and health visitors or, in the case of a person with a disability, ensuring that appropriate facilities were available. Where information on an allegation of torture or some other factor that might argue against detention comes to light only after detention has been authorised, it will be passed to the agency so that consideration can be given to whether the person&#146;s detention should continue.</p>

I will not repeat those arguments today, not least as the noble Lord appears to have changed his own approach to that issue. However, I reassure noble Lords that we already comply with Article 17 of the reception directive, as we are legally obliged to do. Furthermore, the 2005 regulations on reception conditions are concerned with the provision

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07102342000115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked who was to respond to Rule 35 letters, on allegations of torture, from removal centre doctors. Case owners are clearly responsible for considering Rule 35 letters. The noble Lord also made a point about HMCIP criticism and asked whether there should be an independent review. HMCIP regularly inspects all removal centres and short-term holding facilities and therefore has ample opportunity to look at issues such as Rule 35 letters&#151;and it does so often. He also asked whether we would publish the review into Rule 35 and the detention centre rules. I can tell the House that the review will be a quick, informal exercise to see whether changes can be made to the existing content of responses to Rule 35 letters. The results, and any changes that might be made, will be included in published guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07102342000117"></a>I think that that concludes consideration of most of the questions that were asked. I make the further point that cases are very carefully audited and we seek to ensure compliance through that audit process. That is another very important check, because the quality of decisions taken in the asylum process is very important. Senior caseworkers, who are embedded in the original asylum teams, currently order some 20 per cent of interviews and decisions with their teams, using a decision-quality assessment form jointly designed with the UNHCR, so there is a good deal of audit and quality processing. Those forms are collated by BIA, which looks for trends across the region. We believe that that form of monitoring provides us with valuable intelligence about the quality of caseworker decisions. Noble Lords who are concerned about this issue should take some comfort from that.</p>

My noble friend Lady Finlay speaks with enormous authority, drawn from her distinguished medical experience. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has an unrivalled knowledge in your Lordships&#146; House of immigration and asylum matters. I particularly welcomed his suggestion that there should be an audit of the current procedures, particularly under Rule 35, of the detention and removal centres. That, of course, will affect matters only once a person has been detained. I suggest that it would be very much better to prevent them being detained in the first place.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07102342000130"></a>As the Minister will recall, we are concerned about the person who submits an application in time which, through some mistake or misunderstanding either by that person or by his legal representatives, does not include an essential piece of evidence that is necessary to grant the extension sought. I thought that the Minister was saying that in those cases, after being refused because of an error or a missing piece of information, the person would be allowed to lodge a new application within the 28-day period that we were discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07102342000131"></a>I am now informed that the existing extra-statutory concession which the Minister said would be incorporated into the Immigration Rules allows for the application itself to be lodged within the extension time, but not for corrections to be submitted to a document bundle that has been properly lodged within the permitted leave to remain period. It therefore does not cover the examples we discussed in earlier stages of people such as students or work-permit holders whose original application was refused because of some mistake or misunderstanding in putting together the application itself or its supporting documentation, but which is out of time to correct the error in a new application.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07102342000132"></a>I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on 18 July. She raised the particular case of a person who is refused as a result of producing in good faith a document containing a significant error. On that occasion the Minister said in his reply:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07102342000350"></a>&#147;Proposed new Section 85A(4)(c) allows evidence to be submitted at the appeal to rebut a decision by the BIA that a document is not genuine or is invalid ... We would envisage evidence being produced by the applicant to correct that kind of clerical, typographical or administrative error. I think that it would fall within that exception. The interpretation is sufficiently broad to enable that to be the case&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/07/07; col. GC 74.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000323"></a>As I read the let-out in Clause 19(2), new evidence can be produced&#151;I should be grateful if the Minister would pay attention to what I am saying, because I hope that I will have an answer from him. If he could defer his conversation with the noble Lord for a few minutes I would be extremely grateful.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07102342000133"></a>As I read the let-out in Clause 19(2), new evidence can be produced only if it,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000367"></a>&#147;is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000324"></a>whereas in the noble Baroness&#146;s example, which I have just mentioned, the document was clearly invalid because of the errors. I respectfully ask the Minister to consider that his interpretation of proposed new Section 85A may not have been correct, because it does not allow the application to provide information that the original document failed to give in error or to expunge incorrect information that the document gave also in error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07102342000134"></a>The difficulty that both we and the Government seek to address is best achieved by adding to the list in proposed new Section 85A(4), as in our amendment,

In many cases, that wording would allow the matter to be disposed of earlier than under the 28-day extension because, if there is an error of the kind that we are thinking about, the BIA would presumably spot it and refuse in good time for the applicant to correct it well before the 28-day limit.

For a whole new application to be required because of a simple misunderstanding is counterproductive, and an appeal which must consider the facts presented in the original case is no way of ensuring that procedural errors can be rectified before final judgment is given.

Most asylum seekers&#146; first language is not English, and even when they have learned a little, they do not always get the correct advice. Our immigration advisers are not always competent in making sure that no mistakes are made or in understanding what has been said. The amendment would cure much of my correspondence with Ministers of State about misunderstandings and errors. If, as the noble Lord suggested, further evidence emerges within the notice of appeal that can help to provide correct information in cases which would otherwise be turned down because of incorrect information, my sense tells me that that would be the best way to proceed. I support the amendment.</p>

I hope I can offer some reassurance when I say that the points-based-system application process will be much clearer than the existing one about the evidence that applicants must submit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07102342000140"></a>Applications under the points-based system will be made online, not through filling in long forms where the applicant has to identify the relevant boxes. The online system will guide applicants carefully through the process and signpost the way. Applicants will fill in a self-assessment form before making their formal application so that they know whether they are likely to qualify. When they complete the application online, they will indicate the categories in which they believe they qualify for points. The website will then tell them exactly what evidence they need to send to the BIA in order to prove that they qualify for the points. For example, if they claim points for having a degree, they will be told to send in their degree certificate. There will also be a call centre that they can phone if they are unclear. Therefore, there will be far less scope under the points-based system for migrants to send in the wrong evidence or to make the kind of mistakes that the noble Lord is concerned to prevent. Those who do make mistakes in their application despite the additional information and help that we will provide will have to make a new application. We do not believe that that is unreasonable, especially given the lengths to which we are going to make the requirements clear.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07102342000141"></a>The Border and Immigration Agency will have to make a new decision on the new evidence and it is only fair that the applicant should pay the cost of the administration. Concerns have been raised that the applicant will not be able to make a second application if they make an innocent mistake. It has been suggested that, by the time the mistake has been identified, they will not have any leave and their applications will be out of time. If a person applies to extend their stay and they are applying after their leave has expired, it is correct that they would normally be refused. However, where their leave expired less than 28 days previously, the Immigration Rules will provide a grace period. By that I mean that a migrant who does not have leave to be here will still be able to have his or her application considered provided that his or her previous leave expires 28 or fewer days before they make the second application.</p>

Can it really be that the noble Lord does not have friends whose first language is English and who are familiar with computers but who get into stews of one sort or another when faced with long documents and the need to press the right buttons at the right moment? Yet he and his department are putting a lot of faith in people, at a point when they are under great pressure, filling in forms correctly and getting all the things in the right boxes.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07102342000147"></a>Does the noble Lord remember that the original White Paper had the word &#147;fair&#148; in it? The detail with which we are dealing here seems likely to be anything but fair, especially when, at point after point in the process of these last months, we have noted the significant extent to which there are real inadequacies in the provision of legal services at the right moment and around people having sufficient time with a lawyer&#151;we have heard of people who have had perhaps a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes with one. We have heard about the real difficulties with translation services and with people getting to the right detention centre and so on. It seems extraordinary that, at point after point, the noble Lord and his predecessor have seemed utterly determined on this, as if there were brownie points for getting through one of these sittings without giving anything away. That is the impression with which I am left after sitting through hours of this process. I would like him to consider especially the presence of that word &#147;fair&#148;.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07102342000148"></a>My last point concerns the consistent reiteration of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who unfortunately is not in his place today, of the effects on cohesion when people feel themselves constantly to be treated unfairly in the process. Their friends, relatives and co-compatriots receive an impression of an unfair and oppressive system.</p>

As I explained earlier, applicants will have a much clearer idea of what is expected of them in making the application because the points-based system spells it out. On the issue of fairness, that is obviously the most important point.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07102342000150"></a>We make every effort all the way through the process to ensure that applicants are not disadvantaged because of issues of language and understanding.

In any event, those coming to do skilled work will need to speak the English language. However, advice and assistance are quite properly available so that applicants can deal with any difficulties that may arise in how the application works.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07102342000151"></a>I had rather hoped that noble Lords would let me take them through the process. By following it, they may have a clearer idea of what we are trying to do with the new points-based system. I would argue that the proposed amendment will not work within the framework of the appeals system. It is designed to allow the Border and Immigration Agency to reconsider its decision at the point when a notice of appeal is lodged rather than when it is actually heard. Even if we had the resources to make new decisions without charging a second application fee, we would still find it impossible to make new decisions before the hearing. A notice of appeal is lodged directly with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, not the Border and Immigration Agency. The tribunal list the appeal for hearing 28 days from receipt of the notice of appeal. By the time the agency receives a notice of appeal, there is simply not enough time to make a new decision without causing other delays to the appeal system.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07102342000152"></a>Finally, it is worth saying that there is a risk that if this amendment was adopted, everyone who wished to put in new evidence at the appeal stage would claim that they have made a mistake. We would not want to enter into complicated litigation over whether a mistake was made, whether it was inadvertent or whether the entire basis of the application had changed. However, this amendment would encourage exactly that. For those reasons, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary and potentially harmful to the success of the points-based system, which generally has been accepted as being a fairer means of making an assessment and coming to a conclusion.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07102342000153"></a>I believe that there is an outstanding question from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. He asked about the scope of Clause 19(2). If the BIA rejects a document as invalid or not genuine because of an administrative error, we believe that in most cases the exception in the relevant section will allow evidence to correct the error to be admitted, as it will be evidence that the document is valid. I hope that that answers the noble Lord&#146;s point.</p>

If the Minister says that it is not the purpose of the BIA to be punitive for applicants who patch up submissions that are incorrect, that means that it will be able to exercise discretion between cases where somebody submits a piece of evidence along the lines of our suggestion and those where somebody is simply trying to find a lever to reopen the case as a whole. I do not agree with the Minister that it would be difficult to make this distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07102342000157"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and to the most reverend Primate for the support that they have given the amendment. The most reverend Primate has emphasised that errors and misunderstandings inevitably occur&#151;that is the case in any large system. Our experience&#151;as his is&#151;is that this occurs constantly in the immigration and asylum system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07102342000158"></a>I have no doubt that the points-based system will be clearer and that errors are going to be rare, but that does not mean that they will not occur. As I understand the Minister, the person will be able to complete all the questions online and&#151;assuming all the information that he has given is correct and that he has not mis-keyed and typed an &#147;I&#148; where he meant a &#147;7&#148;&#151;will then get a response from the system which is either favourable or not. In a sense, he is able to test the arithmetic of the application but not to verify that the documents to be submitted with the application&#151;the noble Lord gave as an example a degree certificate&#151;will satisfy the requirements. It is those cases&#151;where there might be an error on the certificate from the university that he submits, for example&#151;that we are anxious about, but we are not going to get any further with this matter this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07102342000159"></a>I express some gratitude to the Minister for at least saying&#151;as I had originally thought&#151;that if a person submits an incorrect application that is considered within time and the notice of refusal is served on the applicant, and if it turns out that refusal was based on some error or misunderstanding on his part, he will still be able to submit a fresh application within the 28-day grace period after his existing leave to remain has expired. That is not what the extra-statutory concession allows, but having the Minister&#146;s assurance in <I>Hansard</I> will help to ensure that the final wording in the Immigration Rules satisfies what we had originally intended. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Here I am going to make a concession, and I make it as graciously as I can. I pay tribute to noble Lords on the Conservative Benches. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and her predecessor in this brief&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay&#151;both pressed me on this issue. We had a very constructive discussion on it on Report and I am grateful to all those who have helped us perfect the amendments.</p>

<a name="71023-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07102342000164"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, required that contractors providing services for the Border and Immigration Agency should have to follow the same code of practice on keeping children safe from harm as the BIA. I said at the time that the Government sympathised with the amendment and that they had inserted a section to that effect in the code of practice. We have now considered the amendment put forward by the noble Baroness, and the two amendments to Clause 21 tabled by the Government have the same effect. Importantly, they also make the Border and Immigration Agency responsible for ensuring that those with whom it makes arrangements to provide services follow the code of practice. This is in contrast to it being simply the responsibility of the contractor alone. This now puts it beyond all doubt that those providing contracted services on behalf of the BIA have exactly the same responsibilities towards children as the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s own staff. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07102342000166"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for having taken the matter away and looked at it, and I am particularly grateful for the fact that it is now on the face of the Bill rather than only in the code of practice.

To an outside observer, it was not clear how this would result in better compliance with the obligations in the code. But if it is not to be applied to that new contractor&#151;if it is only to be applied to existing contracts when they are renewed&#151;it will have two and a half years in which to get its act together, which would take a lot of the gilt off the gingerbread of this clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07102342000172"></a>On Report and at earlier stages, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and many others asked the Minister a series of questions about the code of practice, the point at which it was issued and, in particular, its development from the form in which it appeared in whatever kind of a draft it was reported to be in. A fortnight on, it would be interesting to know how that process is going, when it will be available and when Members of the House who have taken an interest in it might be able to see it. The character of this code of practice and the extent to which it covered what it was thought it needed to cover was of considerable interest and some concern on Report.</p>

I join those who are saying that they appreciate it. My only point with regard to the amendment is this: how is it possible to include those who have current contracts as well as those who will have contracts in the future, so that the code will apply to those involved in this work at present?

He won a by-election in 1962, and for 45 years since then he has battled on these humanitarian issues. It has been a great privilege to be able to share the Bill with him.

As regards whether the code of practice can apply retrospectively, the advice that we have received is that it can be applied to existing contracts through the notice of change procedures already in place. We intend to ensure that the Border and Immigration Agency has a system of monitoring contractors&#146; performance by measuring them against a set of standards devised for the specific activities that they carry out for the agency. There is already a set of standards for activities involving families, but we will also consider whether new standards for children are needed when the code is formally introduced.

That is important for the security of us all. If we are to have the protection of designated immigration officers who, if police are momentarily absent at the point of entry, can stop and search and, if need be, detain a suspect for up to three hours until a policeman arrives, we need it at every point of entry throughout the United Kingdom, not just at some entry points. That seems to me patently obvious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07102342000190"></a>This measure may be only an extra failsafe mechanism, but it is important. As your Lordships know, the Scottish Executive have until recently taken the view that at the seven main points of entry in Scotland the police are always present, so this failsafe mechanism is unnecessary north of the Border. However, during the passage of the Bill, it has emerged that, from time to time, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the police at these points are briefly absent. In any case, there are a number of vulnerable Scottish entry points beyond the seven already looked at by the Scottish Executive.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07102342000191"></a>Despite the fact that immigration is not devolved, but is reserved to Westminster, the Government have decided to leave this matter to the Scots Parliament. Therefore, we come to the need for clarification. On Report, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07102342000354"></a>&#147;We have had no commitment as yet from the Executive to legislate on this area; they are considering whether they need to. Border controls are not devolved, but crime is a devolved matter&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/10/07; col. 161.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000326"></a>In the light of that statement, the clarification that I want to ask of the Minister is threefold. First, does the Scots Parliament have the power on its own to implement these measures at all? Secondly, in view of the legislative procedure there, if the Executive have the power and succeed in legislating, how long would it take until the whole United Kingdom is protected? The Law Society of Scotland points out that there could be quite a long delay&#151;of some two years&#151;because of that legislative process. Thirdly, what happens if the Scottish Executive have the power but, being a minority Administration, fail in their attempt to legislate?</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07102342000192"></a>I have given my questions to the noble Lord and I wonder whether he can answer them. In the light of those answers, how do the Government intend to fulfil their responsibility under the Scotland Act to protect the borders of the whole of the United Kingdom? Would it not save everyone a great deal of trouble if the Minister accepted this amendment to the Bill now? I beg to move.</p>

On Report&#151;again, on 9 October, at col. 161&#151;the Minister was very clear when he said that immigration officers are not a devolved matter. The other reassuring element that he emphasised is that the power of arrest for assault will be transferred to immigration officers throughout the United Kingdom. The Minister went on to try to explain:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07102342000355"></a>&#147;It is in the conferral of functions that police officers engage in a devolution issue, in the sense that they will act in Scotland to support the Immigration Service&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/10/07; col. 161.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000327"></a>That phrase skirts around the question; &#147;a devolution issue&#148; does not pin down for us whether it is a devolved issue or a reserved issue. However, so far so good; the police are to act in support of immigration officials, as they do now and, as this Bill seems to contend, they will do so for some long time. As my noble friend said, we have been led to believe that, with the best will in the world, the legislation will not be put forward before March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07102342000194"></a>Unfortunately, it appears that we did not go into the fine detail of the powers required for immigration when we debated paragraph 7 of Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act. So it is all the more important that our discussion today should make the issue absolutely plain. When this provision was before the House, we looked at other aspects to which it applied.

</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000328"></a>In this case, she was referring to the import of illegal drugs, but perhaps the Minister can understand why some of us are puzzled about why the Government have had a change of heart when it comes to immigration officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07102342000195"></a>We are told that the Scottish Parliament will legislate, but Clauses 1 to 4 deal with the powers of immigration officers, not those of the police. Can the Minister explain a little more about the mechanism that is proposed to achieve this transfer of powers in the Scottish context? I am sure that the Minister is aware that Section 29 of the Scotland Act says:</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="07102342000196"></a>Surely if the Scottish Parliament passed a Bill conveying the same powers as are in this Bill, further down the line a smart immigration lawyer will take an appeal, as is allowed under Section 102 of the Scotland Act, to &#147;any court or tribunal&#148; and contend that in this matter the Scottish Parliament is ultra vires. We will be back to calling on the supervisory powers of the Court of Session to try to sort it out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07102342000197"></a>The mischievous side of my nature says that if Scottish law is currently considered adequate to enforce our borders, what is so deficient in English law as to make Clauses 1 to 4 necessary? Of course, in principle, our party is anxious to see that our borders are regulated as properly as they can be. If any other route of allocating powers is used, surely it will mean that immigration officers will not have the same powers in Scotland as they have in the rest of the UK. The only way to guarantee that they have the same powers is to pass my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

At this stage it would be extremely helpful if the Minister would clarify exactly how the Government intend to resolve the inconsistencies within the Bill, which change immigration procedures for half&#151;or two-thirds&#151;of the country, but not for the remainder. There has been, as the Minister may be aware, surprise and dissatisfaction among bodies in Scotland, because the Government do not appear to have acknowledged that they have only a minority in the Scottish Parliament and so cannot pronounce on what legislation it might or might not be able to pass. </p>

The noble Baroness has really put her finger on something that requires attention even at this 11th hour and 59th minute. As I understand it, under the extent clause, Clause 60, Clauses 1 to 4 apply only to England and Wales. Therefore, the powers of immigration officers in those clauses are not operative in Scotland. Because immigration is not a devolved matter, I invite the Minister to agree that extending those powers to Scotland could be done only by the United Kingdom Parliament and not by the Scottish Parliament, which is not enabled to legislate on the functions of immigration officers any more than it does any other immigration matters. Although it was originally said that it had been agreed between the Labour Party in England and its counterparts in Scotland that if the Labour Party had won the election in Scotland it would have introduced legislation in the Scottish Parliament, the Labour Party might have been advised, had it gone further down that road, that that was legally impossible.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07102342000202"></a>We are confronted with a situation now where immigration officers have the powers in England and Wales to detain and search a person for up to three hours, pending the arrival of a police officer, but in Scotland they cannot do so. Yet, as we heard at earlier stages of the Bill, it may be even more necessary in some of the ports of entry in Scotland for that power to be exercised. There may be only one immigration officer&#151;for example, in Shetland&#151;and the police officer may be nowhere near the airport. I do not know what the immigration officer would do if he was confronted with a situation in which he would have exercised those powers had they been available to him, but he could not do so because the Act did not apply. If a police officer cannot be on the spot within the few minutes that it takes for the immigration officer to decide that a person ought to be detained&#151;no doubt the person will abscond when realises that this is the objective&#151;it will be too late. The Minister needs to confront the situation and explain the long-term answer. Are we going to have to wait for further legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament before we can put this right?</p>

I know that she and the noble Duke have a keen interest in ensuring that there is no compromise in border security in Scotland as a result of the measures in the Bill, and I assure the House that the Government are more than equally committed to that objective.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07102342000204"></a>The amendment would extend the provisions in Clauses 1 to 4 on detention at ports to Scotland. This matter has been aired in this House and in the other place on more than one occasion. Before dealing with the substance of the amendment, I stress that Clauses 1 to 4 do not change any arrangements for controlling immigration or for regulating our borders. Immigration officers in Scotland have the same immigration powers as those elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the clauses do not alter that.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07102342000205"></a>The provisions in this Bill, in substance, deal with criminal justice matters and not the control of immigration, which is, of course, a reserved matter.

The Government remain fully committed to respecting the devolution settlement.</p>

I would quite like to proceed through answering the questions. I want to address the fact that during our previous discussions the provisions in Clauses 1 to 4 were viewed by some as being a proxy in some way for the unified border force. They are not. Decisions on the shape and scope of the unified border force will be taken only once the Cabinet Secretary&#146;s report is

The future roles of the police, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Border and Immigration Agency and other agencies&#151;and their position within the unified border force, or in relation to it&#151;will be addressed in that report, along with any considerations about changes to legislation.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07102342000211"></a>I will explain why we do not agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that the amendment is necessary or appropriate. Although immigration is a reserved matter, the detention at ports power will be used by designated immigration officers at ports to allow for the detention of people pending the arrival of a constable. I stress again that this is not about border controls; immigration officers in Scotland  will continue to have the full range of powers  under immigration and, importantly, terrorism legislation.</p>

<a name="71023-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07102342000212"></a>Furthermore, these clauses do not concern the power of immigration officers to arrest individuals for immigration offences, or to arrest a person whom they have reasonably suspected of assaulting an immigration officer. All those powers apply in Scotland as they do in England and Wales. These powers are not for the reserved purposes of immigration or terrorism, but for the purpose of assisting the police for general policing. In Scotland that is a devolved matter. The rationale is that the border is a convenient pinch point for identifying those who may be liable to arrest. This power will assist the police in delivering that objective and will most likely impact on British citizens and EEA nationals as we increasingly merge police databases with immigration watch-lists under our e-borders programme.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07102342000213"></a>As noble Lords will know, responsibility for policing is devolved to Scotland. It is for the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament, not the UK Parliament, to determine the level and type of policing in Scotland and how best to use resources, including whether to enlist the assistance of immigration officers in this way. On the introduction of this Bill, and following discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the previous Scottish Administration concluded that an alternative non-legislative approach was sufficient to deal with people liable to arrest. That involves the routine deployment of police officers at Scottish ports to deal with those identified as liable for arrest for non-immigration purposes.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07102342000214"></a>I understand that the new Scottish Administration have given a commitment to review, in consultation with ACPOS and the Border and Immigration Agency, whether the support of immigration officers is necessary in Scotland and, if so, how any legislative solution should be taken forward. That is the Scottish Administration&#146;s commitment to review.</p>

The designated immigration officer,</p>

<p><a name="07102342000331"></a>That, as I explained, is the way in which it is anticipated the detention clause will operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07102342000217"></a>Perhaps I may continue my response to the amendment. Until that review has been carried out a commitment to replicate the provision in Scotland cannot be given. If legislation is necessary, either the Scottish Parliament could introduce its own legislation or provisions could be brought forward in UK legislation following a legislative consent Motion. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07102342000218"></a>I wish to pick up some of the other points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. I have made it clear that the Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate on the matter. That is what it has agreed to review. It is also our understanding that the legislative programme for the coming year in the Scottish Parliament is tight and further inclusions would need to be discussed and agreed by the First Minister and the First Minister&#146;s Cabinet. I have also indicated that this is not the only option. Provisions could be brought forward in future UK legislation, again following the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Alternatively, the Scottish Executive may conclude that further legislation is not required.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07102342000219"></a>As I said, the deployment of police resources at Scottish ports is a matter for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament. I therefore cannot accept the amendment, because it would be improper to do so. The security of our ports is delivered by a number of agencies&#151;government departments, port operators and the police. The Government take most seriously their responsibility for protecting the borders of all of the UK. That is why issues such as transport security, terrorism and allied matters are reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament in the interests of national security. There will be no compromise in the security of UK borders as a result of these provisions not applying to Scotland.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07102342000220"></a>There was a question on immigration powers and so on. The powers are there for the use of custody officers, for use in detention facilities, and for escorting, but they do not affect the underlying purpose of detention, which is to act in support of the police service.</p>

The previous Lord Advocate, who has just spoken, said one or two things which, I am sure, from his deep experience and skill as a lawyer, have clarified some points. I found it difficult to follow them and shall not try to respond to them.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07102342000224"></a>The Government seem convinced that the Bill will extend to Scotland some functions of immigration officers that apply to criminal justice but not to immigration. That is difficult to understand. They are trying to enable these immigration officers to hold things up until the police come, to help frustrate someone who is trying to immigrate and should not. I take it that the Government have taken advice on that and are convinced. I just hope that they will continue to be convinced and that we shall not have, as someone said earlier, challenges to the law on this point. It is very difficult for a lay person to see that what the Government are saying is so, but one must accept that they have taken good legal advice and that it is correct.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07102342000225"></a>The Minister did not give much encouragement on the length of time that the Scottish Parliament will take to plug the gap in the arrangements. He says that its programme is tight, and I am sure that it is. I expect that it has a fast-track system and that, if it does, it will be required to use it. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who said that half the United Kingdom is vulnerable if Scotland does not legislate quickly on the point. He is probably right: Scotland&#146;s population is not half of the United Kingdom population but its coastline must constitute, if anything, more than half. The vulnerability must be very great before Scotland has legislated.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07102342000226"></a>We have discussed this fully and given the Government every opportunity to see the problems. The Minister has been no more responsive to the questions on this matter than he has on many others. I hope that when the Home Secretary reads the debates on the Bill, particularly at this stage, she will look at what was said by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. They were very critical, but very politely, about the Home Office in relation to the Bill. I hope that the Home Secretary will read that with care. I do not blame the Minster here for not giving in; he has no power to do so and is told what to do by those at the other end of the building. However, we are rather shocked at the way in which the legislation is being dealt with, particularly as it affects vulnerable people.</p>

I have given prior notice of them and am advised that they are within the restrictions imposed by the <I>Companion.</I> We have worked long and hard on the Bill, with extra time both in Grand Committee and on Report, but with precious little to show for all that effort. The chances of making significant improvements were reduced by the decision to parcel the Bill off to a Grand Committee, combined with the latest restrictions on amendments that can be moved at Third Reading. Although a Bill goes through six different stages in this House, in the circumstances of the Bill the main arguments can be brought to a vote only on Report. This may be all very well for some legislation, but it was clearly inappropriate in this case; so the procedure for sending Bills to Grand Committee needs to be reviewed, and consideration needs to be given to whether the latest restrictions on amendments at Third Reading should apply to Bills that do go to Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07102342000232"></a>Secondly, in passing this Motion, the House is relying on codes of practice that deal with critical matters such as the safeguarding of children, which have been published only in draft, and on the many assurances given by the Minister about the way in which the Government are going to use the extensive powers that they are taking in secondary legislation. The Minister said that he would give thought to our suggestion that there should be pre-legislative scrutiny of some codes of practice, and I hope that the same reasoning can be applied to orders. The affirmative procedure, to be used for instance for biometric identity cards, does not provide adequate parliamentary oversight, and the more we hand over powers such as this, which have large implications for our civil liberties, the greater the need for pre-legislative scrutiny of controversial secondary legislation.</p>

It is perhaps worth reflecting just how much time we took in Grand Committee. We sat for six days, having allocated an additional day. More than 23 hours were spent on the Bill. In general, those who have participated will agree that the discussion was not only wide-ranging but profound and that the Bill has greatly benefited from that engagement.

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07102342000234"></a>The Bill&#146;s process was, of course, agreed through the usual channels. I understand that the noble Lord&#146;s party was fully consulted and that, on its initiative, efforts were made to review the way in which the allocation was made. That is its entitlement, and it was quite right to exercise it. I am afraid that the Government do not get what they wish through the House of the Lords, as I and other noble Lords, particularly those who represent the Government as Ministers, have experienced on many occasions. That is the privilege of the House and the way in which it operates, and that is the way it should be.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07102342000235"></a>There were 14 Committee sittings in the other place, of which four were public evidence sittings, so there was the opportunity to interrogate precisely on the childcare and other issues that have so exercised noble Lords. I also understand that the total amount of Committee time on the Bill was some 29 hours, and that Report in another place lasted four hours and 45 minutes. In your Lordships&#146; House, we had 23 hours in Grand Committee and a further 13 and three-quarter hours on Report. Noble Lords have detained your Lordships&#146; House this afternoon for a further two hours. Therefore, I argue that we have very thoroughly considered this Bill. While noble Lords might not like the outcome, we have given it a thorough going over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07102342000239"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this debate comes at a busy time. London hosts several visitors from the Middle East and Afghanistan this week. President Karzai is here today, while Prime Minister Olmert of Israel and Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey are also visiting to discuss the region. Even without such visitors to London, the Middle East is always with us. For better and sometimes for worse, the Middle East is constantly at the top of our agenda, because so many dossiers beyond those of traditional foreign policy alone that matter to us here in the UK&#151;terrorism, crime, drugs and migration&#151;have roots in the wider Middle East and, of course, in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07102342000240"></a>The debate today is sufficiently wide that I felt that I had no choice but to treat this opening intervention as a tour d&#146;horizon, which perhaps can offer some points for subsequent interventions. I am honoured to share the debate with the noble Lord, Lord Roper, who will shortly move his Motion on the EU Committee&#146;s report into the EU and the Middle East. The report is a valuable contribution, not just to today&#146;s debate but to our wider thinking on how the EU should engage in the peace process as it gathers momentum.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07102342000241"></a>I begin with Afghanistan, which I visited last week. Afghanistan is a key priority for us. The Afghans deeply appreciate, as I learnt first-hand, what we are doing in their country. But I must say that I came back from that visit more convinced than ever that Afghanistan&#151;its Government and people&#151;should lead the security and reconstruction effort. The more we are pushed into displacing them in that leadership role, the more counterproductive it is.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07102342000242"></a>I saw last week that a great deal has been achieved in Afghanistan since 2001, including a constitution and presidential and parliamentary elections&#151;the elements, if you like, of a functioning democracy. There has also been the return of 5 million refugees, major improvements in healthcare&#151;82 per cent of people now have access to basic healthcare, compared to just 9 per cent in 2002&#151;and improved life expectancy, education and provision of electricity. Perhaps more surprisingly still, the Afghan economy, which we rightly still think of as one of the poorest in the world, grew some 42 per cent between 2003 and 2006&#151;a year-on-year growth of over 7 per cent. Even on some of the more difficult indicators, there have been improvements. The number of poppy-free provinces, for example, has increased from six in 2006 to 13 this year.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07102342000243"></a>Some of these improvements&#151;from health to reduction in poppy cultivation&#151;are a direct result, at least in part, of the &#163;500 million-worth of assistance provided by this country since 2002. But the successes remain fragile and dependent to a large extent on the security situation. I am afraid that in the southern province of Helmand, where I was a little under a week ago and where British forces are based, insurgency consistently impedes progress.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07102342000244"></a>There is some welcome news about supplementing our security forces in the south, about which I have been asked in this Chamber before by noble Lords. Last week, the Slovakians announced that they will  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1014"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1014</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>double their contribution in 2008, although it is&#151;let me say quickly, before I am challenged on it&#151;a modest contribution, and doubling it will bring it up to 100 troops. Also, France plans to redeploy six Mirage fighters from Dushanbe to Kandahar. That new proximity means that they should be more effective support to our operations.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07102342000245"></a>However, opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, despite the number of poppy-free provinces, has risen for the second successive year, driven by a significant increase in cultivation in the south and, to a lesser extent, the east of the country. The total area under cultivation increased by 17 per cent this year. Cultivation in Helmand province has risen by 48 per cent following a 162 per cent rise in 2006. Today, Helmand is responsible for more than half the entire Afghan poppy crop.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07102342000246"></a>Our new package of measures on counter-narcotics, which we announced on 9 August, is designed to reverse this trend. We are confident that our analysis shows a strong link between access to the rule of law, security and poppy cultivation. Where we are able to succeed in establishing a functioning state, a convincing rule of law and development alternatives for people, the rate of poppy cultivation comes down. </p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07102342000247"></a>I come now to Iraq, where the number of our troops will be reduced to 4,500 by the end of this year and, if conditions allow, to 2,500 by spring next year. This is in line with our long-held strategy of handing over increasing responsibility to the Iraqi authorities as conditions and capabilities allow.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07102342000248"></a>Progress has been made in Basra. The new Iraqi security chiefs there are making a real impact. Increasingly, Iraqi security forces are able to handle the incidents that have occurred, and the overall level of violence has dropped in recent months. There have been positive security achievements elsewhere in Iraq, too: in Baghdad, following the intensified Iraq-led security plan; and in Anbar, where local Iraqi leaders have shown commitment to working against al-Qaeda.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07102342000249"></a>We continue to work in support of the Iraqis so that progress on the security front can be matched and sustained by progress on the political front, which is so critical to long-term peace. At the leaders&#146; conference in August, the Iraqi leadership recommitted to the programme of national unity. We are pressing in particular for regular meetings of the Prime Minister and the Presidency Council to drive forward progress on national reconciliation, which, as one cannot overemphasise, is key to overall political progress in the country. Much depends on whether Iraqis will learn the art of compromise and concession to one another.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07102342000250"></a>Iraq&#146;s neighbours have a central role in supporting Iraq&#146;s future. Issues such as refugees, security of borders and the security of fuel supplies have regional implications for everyone. Conversely, external support for militias and insurgent groups prolongs the violence and threat to Iraqi lives. We welcome the UN&#146;s recent commitment to provide a secretariat for this regional initiative, but a critical factor for success will be the willingness of all Iraq&#146;s neighbours, including Iran and Syria, to recognise that a secure, well functioning Iraq is in their interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07102342000251"></a>The next of these neighbours&#146; meetings is in Istanbul. In the past few days, the Turks have faced unacceptable and deliberately provocative violence from the PKK operating out of Iraqi territory. I want to express our admiration for the restraint of the Turkish response. Turkey is right to seek a solution through dialogue and to focus, if possible, on the long-term gains that a secure neighbourhood would bring.</p>

<a name="71023-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07102342000252"></a>Iraq continues to face acute economic and infrastructure problems. By April next year, we will have spent nearly &#163;750 million on reconstruction. At the beginning of this month, the Prime Minister announced an additional &#163;90 million to create employment and improve infrastructure in southern Iraq. That will provide more than 1 million people with water and power. The southern province, and the city of Basra, is a key region to raise oil revenue. Growth in this region should take hold more quickly and, we hope, act as a multiplier for the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07102342000253"></a>I welcome the increasing international commitment to Iraq. The UN hosted a constructive high-level meeting on Iraq in September, at which I was present. Having participated as a UN official in earlier such meetings, I can record that there is a slow warming of the ice between Iraq and its neighbours. Indeed, other countries are starting to be more active in terms of support to Iraq.</p>

There is no point in spending huge sums of money if they dribble away into the wrong hands. I am thinking particularly of oil theft, which appears to go on the whole time, and continuing reports of money going astray.</p>

As the international financial institutions become more active in Iraq, it has been possible to improve some of the measures and accountabilities for the use of funds. However, I suggest to the noble Lord that there are two primary routes to the corruption in Iraq. The first is the continued insecurity, which allows people to steal oil from pipelines; that would not happen in a country that was well policed and could protect its pipelines against these kinds of actions. The second is the continuing sense of instability that the Iraqi political class has about its survivability. I have always found that, when a regime is not certain about how long it will last, that is the moment when it is most tempted to filter resources into its own accounts and to provide a retirement fund in case government officials are forced to go into exile. Therefore, I argue that the best way in which to combat corruption is first to ensure security, secondly to convince Iraqis that democracy is here to stay and that Iraqi politicians have a long-term future in the country and thirdly to improve the arrangements of international audit and accountability for funds. I acknowledge that progress on all three is not fully satisfactory.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07102342000256"></a>Earlier this month, EU Foreign Ministers committed to enhancing their political engagement with Iraq and its neighbours, which is another sign of growing support for the Government in Iraq. As the Prime Minister has argued in another place, our role in Basra has changed and is moving increasingly towards support for Iraqi authorities. This is a tribute to the determination and dedication of our troops and civilian personnel from the MoD, DfID and the FCO, both British and Iraqi.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07102342000257"></a>I will now say a word about Iran. While Turkey has shown great fortitude in its response to provocation from the PKK within Iraq and while Saudi Arabia is working constructively with Arab colleagues, even towards opening an embassy in Baghdad, I am afraid that I cannot report such healthy collaboration from Iran. Iran is quite simply not a good neighbour. Despite an apparently clear strategic interest on the Iranian side in the success of both Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s Government in Iraq and Prime Minister Karzai&#146;s Government in Afghanistan, both of which enjoy good relations with Tehran, elements of the Iranian regime remain that just cannot help themselves. They are illegally smuggling arms and supporting extremism and violence, and targeting American and British troops in both countries, as well as playing a similar role in Lebanon.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07102342000258"></a>Within Iran itself, the human rights situation is fast deteriorating. In the past 12 months, the authorities have closed reformist newspapers, arrested journalists and editors and confiscated satellite dishes, while websites and blogs have been blocked. Large numbers of teachers, women&#146;s rights activists and students have been arrested for taking part in peaceful demonstrations. This seems to be part of a clampdown by the system on all forms of organised progress. Let me take just one example, that of Mansour Osanloo. He is a trade unionist, the president of the Syndicate of Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company. He has been arrested several times, first in December 2005, when he was detained without trial for seven months, and most recently in July this year. The charges against him are unclear, but trade unions are illegal in Iran. Osanloo has been arrested and imprisoned for being, it seems, just a peaceful trade unionist. He has not been allowed proper access to legal assistance or medical treatment to save his eyesight, which was damaged following injuries that he sustained at the hands of the security forces in May 2005.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07102342000259"></a>Iran is one of the very few countries that still executes juveniles, in violation of its obligations under international conventions. Iran also continues, as I think we are all aware, to violate UN resolutions on its nuclear programme. Mr Larijani&#146;s resignation over the weekend from the Supreme National Security Council in his role as nuclear negotiator has provoked a new round of speculation and concern. We have always insisted that Iran has the right to civil nuclear power, but not to start a regional arms race. In the next months, we expect a new Security Council resolution and discussion within the EU on new sanctions. If Iran continues to defy international demands and refuses to bring its programme into compliance with the demands of the Security Council and the IAEA, there will indeed be further sanctions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07102342000260"></a>As I have said before in this House, let me assure noble Lords that we are committed to solving these issues through diplomatic means. Iran needs to stop moving further into international isolation. We need to draw Iran back into becoming a responsible regional leader and international player, but that will not be achieved as long as Iran feels able to fuel violence in its neighbourhood and develop an illegal nuclear capability.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07102342000261"></a>I shall say a word about the Middle East peace process, which will be discussed at Annapolis in the coming weeks, followed by a major donor conference in December. Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas have appointed negotiating teams and have met fortnightly through the summer. These meetings provide the best opportunity since 2001 to make progress. As the Prime Minister said on 8 October, we cannot achieve what we want in the wider region without progress on Israeli/Palestinian issues. For the sake of time, I will not go further on this issue now, not least in the expectation that noble Lords will wish to return to it during the debate.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07102342000262"></a>A few weeks ago, this Government published their proposals for an economic road map to underpin the peace process&#151;a programme for rebuilding the Palestinian economy and for reducing the high levels of unemployment and poverty among the Palestinian people. Economic development remains a key part of building a constituency for peace and of course the quartet envoy, the former Prime Minister, remains hugely active in support of that agenda. We are providing humanitarian support to Gaza, the West Bank and the Occupied Palestinian Territories at this time. But both parties need to act to establish a just and lasting peace. Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel continue, but equally settlement activity and the construction of the barrier threaten the viability of a future Palestinian state.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07102342000263"></a>Again, I will leave a fuller commentary on Lebanon until later in the debate, but I just note at this point that the key upcoming event is the presidential election due in November, on which many of our hopes for future stability in that country now rest.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07102342000264"></a>I hope that noble Lords will forgive such a rapid tour of this troubled region, but I hope that at least, perhaps in its mistakes as much as in its claims, it will provide a stimulus for the debate to follow. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07102342000267"></a>We are extremely fortunate that we are going to have the opportunity of hearing two maiden speeches in this debate, to which I am greatly looking forward. The first is going to come from my noble friend Lady Warsi who, despite her youth&#151;I hope that does not sound too old from an older man&#151;is hugely experienced in community relations and particularly in the position of women in the war theatres and uglier regions of the world. That matter requires very close attention, which she will give. She is also an expert on racial justice work and will bring very good first-hand experience to our debates. We look forward to that very much.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07102342000268"></a>Later on we will have a second maiden speech from my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones, who is well known to many of us. She was extremely senior in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as political director and was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. I have never been too sure what joints that joint committee was joining but, along with her other past activities, that gives her enormous experience in these areas to share with us. Intelligence and security are central to our national interest and concerns. I look forward to that as well.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07102342000269"></a>I would like to take the subjects in not quite the same order as the Minister. I will begin with Iraq and the threat of Turkish invasion, which are parts of the same issue&#151;the future integrity and survival of Iraq as a nation and, we hope, as a democracy.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07102342000270"></a>Iraqi Kurdistan is already a semi-autonomous part of that nation. Turkey has been remarkably relaxed about the emergence of Iraqi Kurdistan as almost a separate concern within Iraq. The PKK invasion and the threat of a separate Turkish Kurdish state is of course a different matter and a deadly threat to Turkish stability. We must understand that while caution and calls for restraint all round are completely understandable and indeed essential, so too is Turkish anger at&#151;as the Minister says&#151;the highly provocative attacks by the PKK. The problem is this: if neither the Kurds nor Baghdad have any kind of control&#151;or even concede that they should have any control&#151;over the PKK strongholds and the Kandil hill mountain areas, then the Turkish case for doing something is very strong and we can see the point of view of the Turkish leadership and parliament. There is also an interesting debate going on about the legality of it all. If the sovereign power&#151;which is Iraq, with Kurdistan within it&#151;concedes that its writ does not run in the Kandil mountains, is Turkey acting legally if it is to go over the border? It would be valuable to have a comment from the Minister&#151;maybe supported by some legal advice&#151;at the end of this debate.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07102342000271"></a>That is the unnerving position that is developing there. It raises the broader question which all of us dread, which is that it could be a move by an outside power to enter the Iraqi melange and could lead to dangerous pressures for Iraqi break-up, which none of us want. I certainly do not. We will debate our own position in Iraq again and again in the coming months and some of my noble friends, including my noble friend Lord Attlee, will look at the detailed military aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07102342000272"></a>I find the Operation Overwatch timetable&#151;to 4,500 and then 2,500 in the spring&#151;a little worrying, quite aside from the slightly odd way in which it all was announced by the Prime Minister. There is a saying in our phrase-book: &#147;Get in or get out&#148;. The plan now seems to be to go down in the spring to two battle groups. If one of those battle groups is out helping the Iraqis to train or is on the borders, can the other hold the Basra airport encampment if there is a sudden upsurge of extreme and highly populous violence? I do not want to be too fanciful, but our history is unfortunately marked by a number of instances when a brave British outpost was undermanned and over-run, even by more primitive people. We can think of Gordon of Khartoum&#151;no pun intended&#151;and Isandlwana where that terrible thing happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07102342000273"></a>Can the Minister tell me if there is some discontent in Washington with our plans, or are people happy there? We get completely different versions. We are certainly discontented with some of the American procedures in Iraq in recent years. A lot of fingers have been pointed at some of the mistakes made by the American Administration&#151;and by the Americans themselves. I hope that the Miliband mission to Washington that I read about in the papers this morning will clarify things and smooth relations, but I hope it will not be at the cost of being subservient on either Iraq and how we handle it or Iran and how that should be handled. I will come to that point in a moment.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07102342000274"></a>We remain in favour of an independent inquiry into the Iraq saga at the appropriate time to help us see what went wrong, how to put it right and how to apply the lessons elsewhere.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07102342000275"></a>I now come to the Israel-Palestine issue, which some people describe as the key issue, saying that if we can solve Israel-Palestine everything in the Middle East will be sweetness and light. I do not believe that. There are many other long-standing disputes and dangers related to the rise of militant Islam and so on, and those will not disappear if we can get some miraculous advance between Israel and Palestine. The Arab-Israel dispute is certainly the poison in the well and it may be about to get much worse. It links with many other issues such as south Lebanon, the Syrian position and&#151;again&#151;Iran&#146;s role in supporting Hezbollah, Hamas or anything else.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07102342000276"></a>The Minister reminds us that the Annapolis conference is coming up. The conference rooms are all booked. Does the Minister feel that this heralds a change of the whole US policy and approach? Some people may be too hopeful in thinking that it does. Obviously the long-term goal is clear: a permanent peace based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, 1397 and 1515, and on the Madrid principles, the Saudi Arabian peace initiative, the quartet road map and a thousand other efforts. That is where we want to go. Obviously one conference alone cannot possibly achieve this: it could not begin to do so, even if we had had slightly happier vibes and reactions from the leading participants before the conference even began. That is why I agree with the US Israel Policy Forum&#151;a very interesting body striking a new note  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1020"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1020</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in American attitudes to Israel&#151;that the meeting must be one of a series which must be inclusive, produce substantive moves and concessions and have a real impact on the many imperilled and miserable lives of people living in Gaza and the West Bank. It is imperative to avoid the danger of it being all process and no substance, which we have seen too often in the past.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07102342000277"></a>As I said, the mood in the USA may be changing, especially given the enlightened Jewish opinion which argues that the clear aim must be two independent sovereign states&#151;I know Mr Bush has said that, but other voices are now giving him additional support&#151;and genuine homelands respectively for the Jewish and the Palestinian people. There must be borders based on 1967, maybe with one or two negotiated changes; a just solution to the refugee problem; agreement on Jerusalem; and, above all, a freeze on settlement expansion&#151;that cannot go on.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07102342000278"></a>Tony Blair and his mission can indeed play a key part in all this because the embryo Palestinian state, which is not yet really in existence, is not only bisected by settlements but economically destitute. A huge international programme of revival needs to be marshalled and I hope that the former Prime Minister, Mr Blair, will concentrate on that. Certainly he should be supported. That is where he should put his efforts rather than giving Manichaean lectures in America on good and evil. That is what he can do and where his talents can be best applied.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07102342000279"></a>The Annapolis conference and, I hope, its successors need to embrace a wide number of Arab states. It is essential that Condoleezza Rice, with all her travels, persuades the Saudis and the Syrians to get on board, which she has not yet done. The position of Hamas is difficult but, if there is a second conference, that is the point where it could be invited as well. It cannot be excluded in the end, and the quartet and the Americans are going to have to face up to that.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07102342000280"></a>Some of these issues are covered in the EU Committee report, which the noble Lord, Lord Roper, will introduce in a moment. I look forward to hearing what he is going to say. At first reading&#151;I can be persuaded otherwise&#151;the report seems more about the role of the EU than the actual detailed working plans, step by step, of the way in which to move forward. That is in contrast to the American ideas which I have been talking about.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07102342000281"></a>The report brings home to me just how incoherent and unstructured the EU foreign policy role is and, I am afraid, is bound to be. It would be nice if it could be otherwise. Despite brave calls for a more active and imaginative role for the EU, which we all want, somehow it never happens. The same goes in regard to the lack of integration in EU aid policy, which, sadly, has a long history of failure. We should certainly co-ordinate with our European neighbours, or those who are willing, in all kinds of detailed and intimate ways, but we should be cautious about submerging our own unique roles and skills contribution too far into the EU system.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07102342000282"></a>The report strikes me as a warning in this House against seeing too many of our international aims

I should like to hear what your Lordships, and particularly the experienced chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, think about that rumination.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07102342000283"></a>The Minister spoke with great authority on Afghanistan, where he has just been. We all know that this is proving a far tougher nut to crack than earlier hopes implied, as every historian warned us and most of us predicted. We on this side want to hear a great deal more about the overall strategy if we are to accept that yet more troops are going into Afghanistan; we want to know whether the Canadians and Dutch are now pulling out; we want to know what can be done to unify commands effectively; and, above all, we want to know what more can be done&#151;the Minister has spoken about it&#151;to address the narcotics and poppy issues squarely and offer the farmers something better, not deprive them or turn them to the Taliban. The question has to be asked again: why does not the UN or some grouping of nations buy out the whole crop for medicinal purposes? I was surprised to hear the Minister say in one sentence&#151;although he later changed it&#151;that the cultivation had been reduced. In fact, as he went on to say, it has been rising miserably fast. It is a problem that we are not on top of, and it is getting worse at vast expense. Our policy has to change.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07102342000284"></a>The options are narrowing on Iran. Even Mr Putin seems to be losing patience with Tehran. There are fresh ways of turning the screw&#151;Mr Sarkozy has been airing some of them&#151;and those who say that it is either sanctions or a resort to force are giving a false dichotomy; there are options between those two courses of action. Sanctions may be necessary to curb the drift into a military nuclear pattern from a civil nuclear pattern, but we know that China and Russia are never going to come on board and support full UN trade sanctions even if these could be made to work, which many noble Lords said last week they doubted.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07102342000285"></a>Financial sanctions and maybe cyber-sanctions are another matter. Further checks on doing business with Iranian banks or banks connected with Iran could well do a lot more to deepen the divisions in a deeply divided society, which Iran is. The mullahs are cross that they are not getting dollars for their oil, and the young people are clearly fed up with the rule of the mullahs. As I said, the French Government seem to have new zest and ideas on these subjects. Mr Larijani has resigned yet, oddly, turned up at the meetings in Rome. Clearly a lot of internal forces are working against the absolute unified hard line of Iran as a troublemaker, which the Minister mentioned. The one man who could certainly unite Iran is Mr Cheney in Washington, along with his friends. If they decide on an all-out attack, that will consolidate Mr Ahmadinejad&#146;s rule like nothing else.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07102342000286"></a>We want to be friends with the United States in dealing with these terrible problems, but it is a friendship that is rather difficult to maintain. In too many areas, from legal irritants over extradition up to

We all want to see the return of the genial and generous Uncle Sam of the past, but that is not what the world is currently being offered. United States leaders speak of American dominance, but dominance is not the answer. Exporting a simplistic version of democracy, to be delivered by overwhelming force if the medicine is not taken, is not a policy and will not work. I liked the article in the <I>Economist</I> the other day reminding us that democracy is a very loose term and that we should refine it by thinking less in terms of mass ballots, automatic elections, Jeffersonian models or Westminster models and more in terms of the rule of law, open and public discussion and a public-spiritedness in the conduct of affairs. It is a concept which needs careful handling, and nations which believe they can carry it all before them waving the banner of democracy are not going to get very far.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07102342000287"></a>Above all, our American allies have to face the fact, as we do in Europe, that power has shifted to Asia in all these matters. The answer to many of the Middle East problems may well lie as much today in Beijing, Delhi, Tokyo and Moscow as it does in Washington or Brussels. Why do I say that? Because they are the regions with not only the economic power but the political power. They are the regions with the capital and savings generated in enormous quantities, while we&#151;especially the Americans and our own country&#151;are the regions and nations of debt. So they produce the money and we borrow it, and the power tends to lie with those who lend and not those who borrow. That applies as much in the Middle East as elsewhere.</p>

<a name="71023-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07102342000288"></a>Our national interest is to recognise where the new power lies and to work as closely with it as we can. Our history and skills make us well equipped to do so, and the sooner our foreign policy and the present foreign policy of each Government recognise these realities, the better.</p>

He entered your Lordships&#146; House following a distinguished military career, and his military experience and opinions carried huge respect here and beyond.

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07102342000293"></a>When, at the Ministry of Defence in the early to mid-1980s, I was involved in privatising the Royal Ordnance factories and contractorising the dockyards, the official Opposition at that stage was led by a certain new Labour Member of Parliament called Gordon Brown. My ministerial colleague at that stage, the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, visited Rosyth to spell out the benefits of our contractorisation policy. Sadly, if I remember correctly, his ministerial car received a severe rocking, but the men of Lerwick are built of stern stuff and the noble Lord survived. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber today.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07102342000294"></a>I intend to focus my comments primarily on the defence aspects of Afghanistan, although of course the widely held view, as was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is that the failure to solve the Middle East conflict between Israel and the Palestinians lies at the historical heart of so many regional conflicts and terrorism issues. My noble friend Lord Wallace will be talking about the Middle East and its wider dimension later on.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07102342000295"></a>Sometimes I think that, were instructors at staff colleges to create a mythical country posing the most difficult challenge to our forces, it would have many of the characteristics of Afghanistan today: a large inhospitable landmass with extreme temperatures; a complex tribal population; 90 per cent of the world&#146;s opium production, with all the corruption that goes with that; borders virtually impossible to police, with pursuit over them barred; above all, a country that has defeated and devoured invading foreign armies over the centuries. Our forces in Afghanistan today are being asked to undertake a task somewhere between one fraught with extreme difficulty and a nightmare. That they have achieved so much is a tribute to their training, their character and their bravery, but are we asking them to achieve the &#147;Mission: Impossible&#148;, given their limited numbers and resources?</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07102342000296"></a>I am delighted that our military chiefs, politicians across the political divide, the British Legion and the media are now campaigning for greater recognition of what our Armed Forces do for us, for better accommodation, for better medical and psychological support for the wounded and for a better financial package for those service personnel and/or their families following serious injury or death. But all that is for another day&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07102342000297"></a>In the defence policy debate in the other place last week, the Secretary of State, Des Browne, attempted to put the most favourable interpretation on events.  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1024"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1024</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>To be fair, there have been real achievements: 40,000-plus Afghan troops trained; 4.8 million refugees returned home; 83 per cent of the population having access to medical facilities, as the Minister referred to; 5 million children in education; and Afghanistan close to becoming self-sufficient in food production. Virtually parallel with that, however, we have a Chatham House publication entitled <I>Coalition Warfare in Afghanistan: Burden-sharing or Disunity?</I>, which paints a very different picture:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07102342000359"></a>&#147;Western forces&#146; success in fighting the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and in achieving a satisfactory level of security throughout Afghanistan remains limited ... The coalition&#146;s internal cohesion regarding the ... Afghanistan operation is becoming increasingly fragile ... The coalition forces&#146; comprehensive approach towards stability and reconstruction operations remains an elusive concept&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000332"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07102342000360"></a>&#147;The conflict has increasingly become a regional one ... As long as parts of Pakistan serve as a safe haven for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, coalition forces will not be able to control Afghanistan&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71023-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07102342000298"></a>We expected so much from our allies. Western forces in Afghanistan amount to approximately 50,000, plus potentially a similar number of Afghan forces. Using a formula based on population and landmass, the US forces&#146; counterinsurgency manual estimates that a force of 400,000 to 600,000 is required to pacify a country like Afghanistan. Too many NATO countries are just not pulling their weight. We have the ludicrous example, quoted in the aforementioned Chatham House paper, of reconnaissance data collected by German Tornado aircraft under ISAF being denied to the more combat-oriented US-led Operation Enduring Freedom mission. All this with Brigadier John Lorimer, the commander of British forces in southern Helmand province, telling us that troops face a marathon mission lasting decades.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07102342000299"></a>It must be heart-wrenching for our valiant forces to conquer positions and seize territory, only to know that lack of numbers means that those gains cannot be properly held and are likely to have to be retaken. That is intolerable. Thankfully, there has been an improvement in equipment, vehicle protection and helicopter numbers, from a slow start. The dominant problem, however, is a major shortage of troops on the ground. With Afghanistan, we are talking about a country the size of France.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07102342000300"></a>In drawing my remarks to a close, I have four specific questions for the Minister. First, can he foresee a serious increase in troop levels from either ourselves or our allies? Secondly, do Her Majesty&#146;s Government favour the appointment of an Allied supremo to whom the Karzai Government could relate, rather than the current multiplicity of military and civilian chiefs, often with divergent missions? Thirdly, what exactly is our policy on opium production? And, fourthly, given that our Apache helicopters have to be used for escort duties as well as combat roles, what are the implications for the rest of our Apache fleet back in the UK?</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07102342000301"></a>Few can doubt that the uncertainty and concern that reign in Afghanistan today are compounded by a regional backdrop of anxiety: the unresolved Israeli/Palestinian issue, the turmoil in Pakistan, possible

The report from the European Union Committee that we are considering was prepared by its Sub-Committee C, which I chair, and I am grateful to the members of the sub-committee&#151;four of whom will be taking part later in this debate and may also have things to say about our report&#151;and to our staff for the hard work they have put in to prepare it. It is an attempt&#151;this takes up some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford&#151;to discover what value added the European Union provides for its member states in approaching the Middle East peace process as well as trying to find out what further measures could now be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07102342000304"></a>The sub-committee is very grateful to those who gave evidence to us, particularly Dr Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP in Brussels, and Dr Howells, the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We are also grateful to the Government for sending us their reply last week, and for the kind remarks that the Minister made in his introduction today. Some points in the government response showed that they did not fully share our approach, and I will return to these.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07102342000305"></a>The sub-committee had completed taking evidence and virtually completed the report when&#151;as we make clear in chapter six&#151;the growing hostilities in Gaza and the West Bank between Fatah and Hamas and the takeover of Gaza by Hamas militias led to the dismissal of the National Unity Government and the declaration of a state of emergency by President Mahmoud Abbas. While these significantly changed the environment, the sub-committee believes that they reinforce the overall conclusion of our report&#151;that the European Union now needs to play a more active and energetic role in the search for peace in the Middle East. I will return to this.</p>

The Saudi initiative, which led to the Mecca agreement, provided the basis for the Palestinian National Unity Government in mid-March. On the diplomatic front, the United States Secretary of State increased the number of her visits to the Middle East in an attempt to unblock the negotiating deadlock and Dr Solana was tasked by the European Union's Council with missions to the Middle East, including direct talks with the Syrian and Saudi Governments.</p>

It is fair to say that although the United States has normally led the political negotiations, the European Union has often provided innovative ideas, and since 2002 through its role in the quartet, has been directly involved in the negotiations together with the United States, Russia and the United Nations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07102342000308"></a>The European Union has also played an important part in humanitarian aid, and from 1995, in providing financial and technical assistance for the creation and functioning of the institutions of an emerging Palestinian Authority. We were told that at one stage it provided half of the budget of the Palestinian Authority. The European Union, taking together the spending of the European Commission and the member states, is far and away the largest donor to the Palestinians, estimated by the Government in their response to be some &#8364;800 million in 2007. There is no doubt that at various stages there was abuse of some of this aid but we received evidence of a variety of mechanisms that had been introduced to check that the funding was properly monitored.

<p><a name="07102342000333"></a>Although, as the report makes clear, European Union aid, and for the last year the temporary international mechanism,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000372"></a>&#147;has prevented a very serious humanitarian crisis from becoming even worse ... [it] should ... not divert the ... EU from the root causes of the insecurity and poverty in the Palestinian territories&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000334"></a>Analysing the impact of the boycott of the Palestinian Government introduced by key members of the quartet in March 2006 following their assessment that the Hamas-led Government had not complied with the three principles, the sub-committee expressed its grave concern,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000373"></a>&#147;about the security, human rights and socio-economic situation in the occupied Palestinian territories&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000335"></a>The sub-committee cited the European Union General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusion of 18 June 2007 which stated that the,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000374"></a>&#147;EU will do its utmost to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza, whom it will not abandon. Unimpeded access to humanitarian aid deliveries must be guaranteed&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07102342000309"></a>Since the report was completed the situation has deteriorated in both the West Bank and Gaza, as the valuable reports from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs make very clear. There are too many of these to quote, but in the West Bank UNOCHA reported in September that 40 more control points had gone up compared with the position in June. That was in the West Bank, not in Gaza. In Gaza the position has also deteriorated in the past month since the Israeli designation of the strip as an &#147;enemy entity&#148;. In its report of 9 October on Gaza, UNOCHA stated that since 19 September a large reduction has been reported in the number of

The average of 106 truckloads per day that was recorded between 10 June and 13 September has dropped to approximately 50 truckloads per day since mid-September. This trend is giving rise to growing concerns among aid agencies about shortages of certain food supplies.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07102342000310"></a>As regards the opportunity for those in Gaza to get medical assistance, in September there was a significant reduction in the number of patients crossing into Israel and the West Bank for medical treatment: fewer than five patients crossed each day compared to an average of 40 patients per day in July.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07102342000311"></a>The situation is perhaps best summed up in the statement made yesterday after news came of the closure of medical units and clinics because of the absence of anaesthetics. Sir John Holmes, the United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07102342000361"></a>&#147;The economic noose continues to tighten around the necks of the people of Gaza, who are being manifestly punished as part of a political strategy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000336"></a>In this situation I should like to ask the Minister what the European Union and its member states are doing to fulfil the commitments they made in June not to abandon the people of Gaza.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07102342000312"></a>The sub-committee was concerned at the rigidity of the European Union within the quartet over the three principles, particularly after the creation of the National Unity Government in March of this year. The committee was clear,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000375"></a>&#147;that the European Union's support for a Palestinian coalition government, including Hamas could not have been unconditional. To require that a Hamas-led government not only renounce attacks but use its governmental authority to prevent such attacks was entirely justified&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000337"></a>As regards the requirement to accept and respect the positions established collectively by the Arab side, we considered that by signing the Mecca agreement the Government had committed themselves to respecting the existing bargaining position and agreements signed by the PLO and more generally by the Arab side. On the other hand, the question of the formal recognition of the state of Israel as distinct from the de facto recognition implicit in accepting the objective of a two-state solution seems open to debate.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07102342000313"></a>Hamas, we felt,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000376"></a>&#147;regards recognition of Israel as the object of the peace talks ... rather than a condition that can be met prior to discussions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000338"></a>We expressed the hope that the Government and the European Union would,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000377"></a>&#147;reconsider the precise formulation of any conditions [on this subject] and ... apply them in future with a reasonable amount of flexibility&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000339"></a>We regret that on this point the Government in their reply was unable to agree.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07102342000314"></a>As chairman of the sub-committee it is not appropriate for me to discuss in detail the approach adopted by Secretary of State Rice in her negotiations or the prospects for the meeting in Annapolis later this year. I wish them well, even if it is difficult at this stage to be too optimistic about the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07102342000315"></a>However, two matters discussed in our report are relevant to the ongoing search for peace. We made clear that the peace process should not be held hostage by any faction, individual or state. We said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07102342000362"></a>&#147;Although each situation is different, recent experience in other situations, such as Northern Ireland, can [provide] valuable lessons on how to bring into the peace process individuals and movements who previously espoused violence".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000340"></a>That was linked to our view, reiterated after the events in Gaza in June, that a precondition of the success of any peace process is that it must be as inclusive as possible. I welcome the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, on this point. The exclusion of Hamas can be explained by its behaviour, but many of us feel that it significantly reduces the chances of ultimate success.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07102342000316"></a>The overall conclusion of our report was that the European Union,</p>
<ul><a name="07102342000378"></a>&#147;now needs to play a more active and imaginative role in the search for peace in the Middle East than it has done in recent years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102342000341"></a>We made it clear that this should be in close co-operation with the United States. However, in the developments since June, the initiative has been very much that of the Secretary of State of the United States. Whatever happens between now and the end of the year, it would be important that the European Union realises the central contribution it an its members can make to the political, as well as the security, development of the Middle East in the coming months.</p>

Religious beliefs and values permeate what may appear to be just diplomatic, political and even military moves. It is as well for us to recognise this reality and to structure our response accordingly.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07102351000002"></a>Whether we like it or not, the Westphalian consensus is dead&#151;certainly in this region, if it ever existed there. But such a death also has implications for us in our conduct of business. One way to discover people&#146;s religious commitments is dialogue. An Iranian minister said to me recently, when asked, that the cornerstone of his country&#146;s foreign policy was &#147;the spirituality of justice&#148;, to which I replied, &#147;What about the spirituality of love?&#148;. But this dialogue needs to respect the integrity of each side and cannot be conducted on terms decided by one side alone, which was a danger in the otherwise welcome letter written by some Muslim leaders recently.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07102351000003"></a>What should be on the agenda for such a dialogue? It seems clear that Islamist movements of various kinds will remain important on this scene for some time to come. The question is&#151;this has already been implied&#151;whether their programme is to be merely theocratic or whether they will recognise the need for intermediate political, social and legal institutions. Some such movements are in an interesting phase of  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1029"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1029</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transition in this respect. Islam has never historically produced an enduring theocracy. There have always been political institutions, such as the caliphate; legal ones to codify, develop and implement the Sharia&#151;we need to note the very important role played by Muftis, the jurisconsults, in the development of fiqh or codified law; the role of the Grand Mufti in Egypt at this time in this area is worthy of note&#151;political and legal institutions; and, of course, we must not forget the socio-religious ones such as the Sufi orders. It has been shown that wherever Sufi orders have been suppressed by authoritarian regimes there has been some kind of emergence of fundamentalist and militant movements.</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07102351000004"></a>In the region, there are customary and religious means of governing by consent. That is the phrase we should adopt rather than the loosely used word &#147;democracy&#148;, as the noble Lord has already reminded us. In the joint declarations between Afghanistan and the UK, and between Afghanistan and the European Union, there is a welcome commitment to develop parliamentary institutions in that country, but how will it be done? What kind of development will there be? The convening of the Loya Jirgah, reformed to include women, was a good start in using a customary institution to promote government by consent. Will such sensitivity continue to be shown in the further development of a participatory system in Afghanistan as the national assembly and the provincial assemblies are developed? What about Iraq? As I have said previously in this House, both religious and customary practices&#151;such as baia, the recognition of a ruler&#146;s legitimacy, and shura, a process of participatory consultation&#151;can be developed here to provide continuity. In the past, the Government have always responded to such suggestions to use custom and religious institutions by saying that the Iraqi people are free to have the form of government that they want. But do we not have a responsibility for taking history, custom and faith seriously as partners, for better or for worse, in this dialogue?</p>

<a name="71023-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07102351000005"></a>In the relationship with Iran, we have to be aware of the complexity of Irani society. We do not have the political and social monolith of Saddam Hussein&#146;s Iraq. It is quite possible to continue dialogue with sections of even the ulema&#151;they were referred to as mullahs recently, but no matter&#151;academics, prominent politicians and government officials, and even to discuss, as has been said, the possibility of a modern civilian nuclear industry, as with the P5+1 proposals, as well as Iran&#146;s genuine security worries, without in any way condoning internal oppression or external aggression and condemning in no uncertain terms any threats to destroy the state of Israel. Their great poet, Firdausi, who wrote a book on the politics of kings long ago, said that,</p>

<p><a name="07102351000019"></a>hundreds of words do not compare with half a good deed. Iran needs to show, by word and by example, its peaceful intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07102351000006"></a>If we agree that the role of religion in the state must always be persuasive and never coercive, what are the implications for the application of Sharia law in Muslim countries? This is a crucial issue, affecting fundamental

Debate about this matter is often ill informed on every side. We need a comparative study of how Sharia law relates to the constitutions and laws of different nations. It relates differently in different places. We need much further work on understanding the dynamism of the different schools of law in Islam, and how principles for development can be identified and applied. Education, education and education are certainly the priorities here.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07102351000007"></a>In a region fraught with conflict&#151;how many speeches so far have been about that?&#151;it is important to have some convergence on when intervention is justified, or even necessary, to prevent oppression, destruction and genocide. This can be greatly facilitated by in-depth dialogue on the respective Islamic and Christian traditions of jihad and the just war. While there are significant differences between these two traditions, some convergence is possible, and such dialogue is now urgent. How will it be undertaken?</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07102351000008"></a>One of the prominent features of interfaith dialogue today is the need for a common commitment to freedom of belief, freedom of expression and the freedom to change our beliefs. We must note here the position of Christian and other communities in the region. We have recently been reminded of the perilous position of the Christians in Iraq: nearly half are now refugees in Jordan and Syria. There can be no justice unless these minorities are fully enfranchised and are secure. Whether it is the beleaguered Christians of Iraq, the Maronites in Lebanon, the Copts in Egypt, the Baha&#146;is in Iran&#151;or indeed the Jewish people in the Holy Land, taking the region as a whole&#151;there has to be an end to persecution, the acceptance of coexistence and mutual respect.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07102351000009"></a>It is quite possible to see what a two-state solution might look like in the Holy Land, and how shared sovereignty over Jerusalem, with particular provision for the holy places, might work. How that might happen has not been mentioned, but it will be one of the difficulties in any final status talks about Jerusalem.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07102351000010"></a>Will the extremists be allowed to frustrate the realisation of such a vision? It is vital to understand that extremist anger is not caused by western policies&#151;exacerbated maybe, but not caused. Rather, such policies are being used an excuse to establish dominance&#151;the real agenda of some kinds of extremism in the region. Of course, extremists should not be provided with excuses, but neither should we capitulate to their desire for dominance. As always in the Middle East, &#147;Assabr miftah al-faraj&#148;&#151;patience is the key to a happy ending.</p>

He certainly contributed to what nobody really expected to happen in Ireland; we are all immensely grateful that it has. He has an impossible task, but he might make it possible. In the circumstances, we are proud that he is the quartet&#146;s special envoy to the Middle East peace process. His role is one of state-building and I hope that he will help to remove corruption and create infrastructure&#151;not least in the Palestinian Authority&#151;and that there will arise a viable Palestinian state which can support a lasting peace.

Only if people speak together is there hope of peace between their peoples. It is important that all the major players are engaged in the Annapolis summit.

One hand alone cannot clap, as in the Arab proverb. I work with Prince Hassan of Jordan in the Muslim-Jewish Coexistence Trust. We have to work together or we will die separately. Wherever I travel, the biggest concern for everybody is undoubtedly Iran. It is a particular threat to Israel.

I realise that Russia is not easy to deal with, especially given our current difficulties.

In June 2001, Saira Shah, a British journalist, revealed the horrific lives of many ordinary Afghani women. She was assisted in her efforts by RAWA, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. She exposed an Afghanistan where women were excluded from jobs and medical care, where education was denied them and where war widows were forced to beg on the streets of Kabul. This was Afghanistan under Taliban rule. On International Women&#146;s Day in 2007, some six years after our invasion, RAWA said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07102357000071"></a>&#147;the world came into motion in the name of liberating Afghan women and our country was invaded, but the sorrows and deprivation of Afghan women has not just failed to reduce but has actually increased the level of oppression and brutality&#148;.</ul>

<ul><a name="07102357000072"></a>&#147;eliminate child and forced marriage by 2008&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102357000070"></a>Sadly, that honourable aim is unlikely to be met by then or at any time in the near future.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07102357000005"></a>I acknowledge that some progress has been made. As we know, 27 per cent of Members of the National Assembly are women, but only one serves in the Cabinet and, sadly, too many are ineffective and subdued. Indeed, in recent provincial council elections, not enough women came forward to take up the women&#146;s quota, resulting in some of the reserved women&#146;s seats reverting to men. I pay tribute to Malalai Joya, a brave and determined young Afghani parliamentarian who more than deserves the international accolades that follow her, but whose life is under constant threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07102357000007"></a>Abduction and rape is widespread, and officials are killed merely for registering women to vote. An extremely disturbing phenomenon is the ever increasing number of Afghan women who seek death by fire: women who are set alight or set themselves alight in sheer desperation. Cases of self-immolation have doubled in Kabul in the past year alone, and the situation is even more acute in the city of Herat. Human Rights Watch believes that contributing factors are severe governmental and social discrimination, illiteracy and an incompetent justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07102357000008"></a>The pictures alone do not fully describe the plight of these women. It is a subject close to my heart and one of which I have direct experience. I chair a women&#146;s empowerment charity, the Savayra Foundation, which seeks to empower women in Pakistan through education and training. Sadly, I meet many abused and desperate women, but one in particular remains vivid in my mind. Aliya, a beautiful 21 year-old woman, a loving mother of two, was set alight by her husband in her home in the Pothohar region of Punjab. She presented herself to me with severe burns and disfigurement from her scalp to her waist. She is a woman whose children fear her because of her appearance. She is a woman who simply longs to hug her young son.</p>

I also thank noble Lords from all sides of the House for their very warm welcome and constant offers of tea, far too many of which I have reluctantly had to decline in the interests of my growing waistline. Finally, I thank those who serve your Lordships&#146; House, many of whom have accompanied me while I was lost in the numerous corridors, and who always smile when they realise that I am the newest and youngest Member of your Lordships&#146; House and not an intern.</p>

I would like to say how welcome she is in this House too. She adds to both our regional and ethnic diversity, both of which are to the good. She has been given a highly topical but rather difficult and important subject&#151;community cohesion&#151;which I feel needs shaping and defining as well as prescribing. I hope that she will help us to do that.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07102357000012"></a>Perhaps I may also stray a little from the normal practices of this House by offering a pre-emptive welcome to the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, who is speaking later. I think that I am not allowed in the practices of this House to refer to her as my noble friend, but she is undoubtedly noble and she is my friend.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07102357000013"></a>It is timely that we should have this opportunity today for a debate on the Middle East and Afghanistan. I am grateful, too, that the report on the European Union and the Middle East peace process, produced by the sub-committee on which I currently serve, is being brought within the ambit of our debate. With the important conference on the peace process summoned by President Bush due to take place next month, it was high time for the House to have an opportunity to discuss our recommendations and the Government&#146;s response to them. I hope that the Minister will not take offence if I describe the latter&#151;the Government&#146;s response&#151;as bland even beyond the normal average for my old department. I can see why references to keeping channels of communication open to Hamas and the need for an inclusive peace process might provoke an evasive response, but why on Earth the Government cannot agree that it is now important to begin to address final status issues as well as process completely eludes me.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07102357000014"></a>It would, I fear, be a triumph of hope over experience to say that President Bush&#146;s conference is taking place under particularly propitious circumstances or with particularly high expectations of success. The weak position of both the Palestinian and Israeli Governments&#151;and, one could add, that of the US Administration&#151;increases the likelihood that tough choices will be ducked or fudged. The divisions among the Palestinians, with the exclusion  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1035"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1035</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Hamas from any participation, can be welcome only to the most short-sighted. Nevertheless, it would surely be unwise to approach the conference in a spirit of cynicism or of exaggeratedly lowered ambitions; to do so would likely be self-fulfilling, and another failure will only stoke the fires of extremism that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester referred to in his contribution, which are already burning fiercely enough across the Middle East and more widely across the Islamic world.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07102357000015"></a>What is needed is not just another photo-opportunity conference&#151;not some vapid declaration of principles which are then interpreted in totally contradictory senses by each party within a few weeks or even a few days&#151;but rather the establishment of a robust and structured process designed to get to grips not just with interim deals and fixes like the road map but with the core issues of a two-state solution: frontiers, Jerusalem, security arrangements and refugees; a process that can survive the vicissitudes of next year&#146;s US presidential election and which can be sustained through whatever acts of violence the enemies of a peaceful negotiated solution may throw at it. I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Howell, referring to a study on the US side of the Atlantic which comes to precisely the same conclusion as I have just suggested. It would be good to hear from the Minister what the Government and the EU&#146;s objectives are for that conference and what enhanced role the EU can hope to play in its aftermath.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07102357000016"></a>There is also, I would suggest, a sub-plot here over the role of the United Nations in any process. There are renewed calls for the UN to pull out of the quartet and thereby, it is suggested, to regain what is described as its freedom of action. I believe these calls to be misguided and I hope the Government will advise the Secretary-General to resist them. It has been a mistake for two successive Secretaries-General, Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-Moon, to forbid their special representatives in the region to have any contact with Hamas, or with Hezbollah for that matter. The UN should be prepared to talk to all parties in disputes of this sort. But reversing that mistake does not require the UN to pull out of the quartet. After all, the Russians accept no such constraints on contact with Hamas and yet they remain in the quartet. And just what would be this freedom of action that the UN would have if it distanced itself from the key external co-ordinating group?</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07102357000017"></a>Turning to Iraq, I do not want to get drawn into a detailed analysis of the prospects for stabilising the situation. Having tried a whole range of futile, counter-productive and poorly implemented strategies, the United States does now seem to be making the best of a pretty desperate job. But there is one particularly urgent problem that has the capacity to further destabilise the country and to which the Minister referred in his opening speech&#151;it is particularly topical this week given the visit to London of the Turkish Prime Minister&#151;namely, the tension between Turkey and the Kurdish region of Iraq over the incursions of PKK guerrillas and the possibility that Turkey will launch military operations across the border. That would be a high-risk  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy fraught with many possible unintended and negative consequences for all concerned. I hope that the Minister will say something about the line that the Government will take on this matter with Prime Minister Erdogan.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07102357000018"></a>It is hard not to feel some sympathy with the Turkish Government, faced with the casualties to their armed forces, and also to feel that the Kurdish regional government are not perhaps doing all they could or all they should be doing to prevent their territory being used for these incursions. No doubt the Americans are better placed than we are to address that aspect of the problem, but concerted pressure on all and a concerted effort by all concerned will be needed if a Turkish Prime Minister who has done more than any other to alleviate the situation of his ethnic Kurdish compatriots and who has resisted the earlier pressure for military action from his generals is not to be drawn dangerously down that road.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07102357000019"></a>Then, there is the threat to the peace and security of the Middle East region posed by the doubts that still hang over Iran&#146;s nuclear programme and by Iran&#146;s refusal to accede to the Security Council&#146;s request that it suspend its uranium enrichment programme. Neither Iran&#146;s response so far to that request, nor the Iranian President&#146;s overblown and often vicious rhetoric, nor the recent resignation of Iran&#146;s chief nuclear negotiator leave any grounds for complacency or illusions. An Iran with nuclear weapons or with fissile material enabling it to develop such weapons in short order would seriously destabilise one of the already most unstable regions in the world, irrespective of the wider implications for our own and our Allies&#146; security and for the future of the non-proliferation regime. So a renewed effort and new initiatives to agree a diplomatic solution are now, I would argue, becoming overdue.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07102357000020"></a>It was quite right for the IAEA&#146;s director-general to seek to clear up all the remaining doubt about Iranian past activities during the long period when it was operating a clandestine programme in breach of its international obligations. Dr El Baradei has been quite unreasonably criticised for doing what is simply his job to do. But however successful the agency&#146;s work in that respect, it will not resolve the problems caused by Iran&#146;s enrichment programme and the doubts about its future intentions.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07102357000021"></a>A further sanctions package may well be needed, but as our debate on economic sanctions earlier this month demonstrated, sanctions are not an end in themselves and they cannot work in isolation from diplomatic action. What is needed is that the United States should accompany any decision on further sanctions with an unconditional offer to join talks with Iran over the whole range of Iranian and international concerns. That, after all, is what it has done with North Korea, and it does seem to be having some beneficial effects. Why can it not be tried with Iran? I would be grateful if the Minister will say whether the Government would support such an approach.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07102357000022"></a>When the House last debated the situation in Afghanistan, the Minister said that the Government

I wonder if he could say a little more in his wind-up speech about the outcome of that review, though he did speak very interestingly about his recent visit there when he opened. I shall focus on one aspect only: the counter-narcotics strategy.</p>

<a name="71023-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07102357000023"></a>As Afghan production of opium continues to rise, with forecasts of further rises next year, how long will it be before we recognise that present policies are not working and are almost certainly not going to work? Since our debate earlier this autumn, the Senlis council has produced what seemed to me at least some interesting ideas for pilot projects linking the controlled legal production of opium with the pharmaceutical use of the drug. We know that controlled production can work and has worked in Turkey and in India. No doubt Afghan conditions are much more challenging. But is it not time to give something like this a try?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07102357000024"></a>Any glance at the Middle East and Afghanistan is liable to leave one even more pessimistic and daunted than when one began, but pessimism is a poor prescription for effective diplomacy. We face massive challenges in this region, some of them due to our own earlier mistakes and miscalculations; and I am not speaking here only about Iraq. We need now to try to put that behind us and to work with as wide a degree of international co-operation as we can muster for better outcomes in the future.</p>

It is good to be sandwiched between two distinguished former diplomats. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, always speaks with great authority and I am confident that the noble Baroness who is about to deliver her maiden speech will follow in those tracks, particularly regarding her major areas of expertise in counterterrorism and the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07102357000026"></a>As the noble Lord has just said, several tectonic plates grind against one another in the Middle East, causing disturbances in many different areas, but the constant is the conflict between Israel and Palestine. If there were to be a solution there, it would not solve other regional conflicts, but it would certainly make those conflicts more manageable. I shall concentrate on the prospects for the proposed conference in Annapolis, although it appears that only the location has been decided; timing, participants and agenda are in the air. As is the case with any debate on the Middle East, there are already two starting points.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07102357000027"></a>First, as we saw to our cost in the EU Sub-Committee after we embarked on our inquiry, there is the arrival of the unexpected, such as the coup of Hamas on 15 June this year. We had looked closely at the position that we would adopt in relation to Hamas. Then came its dramatic and violent takeover of Gaza and the subsequent entrenchment of what many now see as an Islamist state, heavily supported by Iran. We pressed on, notwithstanding that dramatic turn of events. We included a brief Chapter 6, attempting to foresee the consequences of that  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1038"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1038</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>takeover. What is new is the increasingly bitter division among the Palestinians, which reflects a wider Sunni/Shia split in the region. The takeover is a good illustration of the unpredictability of events in the Middle East.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07102357000028"></a>The second complicating factor is the irrationality of much of the debate. That combination of unpredictability and irrationality must make one apprehensive about the prospects of success for any proposed conference, even if it is essentially a cover for relations between the two principal participants&#151;the Palestinian Authority and Israel&#151;leading to a series of other conferences.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07102357000029"></a>After all, as my noble friend the Minister knows all too well, the United Nations was extremely confident after 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The UN had enormous success, which I witnessed, in Namibia. It appeared then that everything was attainable. Alas, it was not to be. Yes, we had the Oslo accords in the 1990s, but as the outcome of Camp David showed&#151;even with a United States President prepared to commit much time and political capital to the region, and with a pragmatic Israeli premier in Barak&#151;the initiatives came to nought. Abu Ala, the current Palestinian negotiator, claimed to me that the failure arose because the US Administration were pushing too hard when he and his Israeli interlocutor, Shlomo Ben-Ami, were step by step moving in the ways of the Levant in the correct direction. Others blame Arafat&#146;s indecision and personal weakness. As Shimon Peres frequently states, the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. What is clear is that the road map seems to have petered out in the sands before either party had completed their obligations under the first stage. At a time when Arab leaders in 2002 were promoting an interesting initiative, the Bush Administration, if only as a riposte to the Clinton Administration, turned away from the region until this year.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07102357000030"></a>What are the negative features as we approach the conference? The first is political weakness on all sides. Prime Minister Olmert has been damaged by the incursion into the Lebanon, and the Palestinians by fratricidal strife. There is a lame-duck US President who has little credibility in the region as a result of the Iraq invasion and does not want his foreign policy legacy only to be seen as Iraq. Can the Palestinians make progress when their negotiations are led by the Fatah old guard, notably Abu Ala, and when Hamas, which it now bitterly hates, is wholly excluded from the process?</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07102357000031"></a>However, there are some positive signs. At least Israel and Palestine are in direct talks. There is little detail, but this fact is a good sign. Benchmarks have been established in earlier talks and, the reverse side of my earlier point, Hamas is out of the picture&#151;at least in the early stages. Key Arab players are engaged. They have visited Israel, are concerned about growing Shia influence in the region and have a credible set of agreed proposals, led by Egypt and Jordan. It may be that the Saudis have reached some sort of deal&#151;explicit or implicit&#151;with the US Administration to assist in Iraq if the US presses harder in Palestine. Equally, there is a wider coalition  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1039"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1039</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>within the Knesset and President Abbas clearly wants peace, whereas Arafat&#146;s motives were unclear. The regional intervention may provide an acceptable cover for bilateral accords.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07102357000032"></a>What in the Government&#146;s view are the chances for the coming conference and the best means of making progress? The devil is not in the details, but in the key principles, which are well known. Is there at least a prospect of a comprehensive armistice or hudna beyond the negative or limited ceasefire? Is it at least worth seeking shorter, practical and pragmatic steps that would create realities over time? For example, Israel, in an effort to produce trust between the parties, released more than 250 prisoners in July and has released several batches of prisoners since then. As part of the Oslo family and reunification policy, Israel will be granting residency permits to 5,000 Palestinians who have been living illegally on the West Bank. There has also been the symbolic act of the beginning of reconstruction of the roadway between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Much can be done on the economic side and I commend the Government for their initiative on 17 September of launching an economic report. There cannot be real progress without tackling the economic misery on the Palestinian side.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07102357000033"></a>On Iran, I believe that the Foreign Secretary has, as yet, refused to follow Jack Straw in stating that the use of force would be &#147;inconceivable&#148;. Financial pressures, with enhanced sanctions, public and private&#151;including from the banks, which may be of greater importance, as they were in South Africa&#151;are the most likely means of achieving a moderation of policy. A military strike on the three major nuclear installations would only make moderates rally behind the flag at a time when there is real discontent&#151;one thinks of the tomato problems in the spring of this year, signs of disaffection among the populace and words of caution by the Supreme Leader and by Rohani regarding President Ahmadinejad. Would it not be more helpful if the US was to show Iran that it was not focused only on regime change and was more pragmatic, as it was regarding North Korea, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said?</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07102357000034"></a>Finally, a postscript on Afghanistan. There has been the very bad news in the recent UN report about the increase in drug production, which the Minister set out in his speech. President Karzai has acknowledged that the security situation has deteriorated, with a recent upsurge in violence, and it is clear that not all NATO countries are pulling their weight, as many like to think that they can operate only from relatively safe areas in the north. Clearly, there should be consensus that we must be there for the long term and provide the necessary resources, because a failure in Afghanistan, with even greater poppy production affecting our streets and even greater sources of terrorist activity by the Taliban, would have the most adverse repercussions not just in Pakistan and the region, but over the world as a whole. Therefore, at least let us be agreed that we cannot, as a world community, countenance failure in Afghanistan and the return of the Taliban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07102357000036"></a>Like my noble friend Lady Warsi, I will focus my contribution to the debate today on Afghanistan. I recently accompanied the leader of the Conservative Party on a visit to that country. One should always be careful about drawing long-range conclusions from short visits such as ours but, in a less than ideal world, it is still better to have had some direct experience of the issues than none at all. Strapping on body armour before stepping into the heat and dust of Helmand province quickly brings home the reality of the challenge faced by our brave service men and women.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07102357000037"></a>The level of the British military commitment in Afghanistan is striking. At Camp Bastion in Helmand, we have built a military base of significant size, which is in the process of further upgrading. That seems right, because if this country is serious about Afghanistan&#151;and, in my view, we must be&#151;neither our forces nor our civilian personnel will be leaving in short order and they must be properly housed and protected. I shall return later to the likely length of the mission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07102357000038"></a>Public discussion of the British commitment has tended to focus on three issues: whether we should be in Afghanistan at all; whether our forces have been properly equipped to carry out the mission entrusted to them; and whether they are succeeding. In this short intervention, I am not going to deal in detail with the second of these issues. Suffice it to say just two things. The recent decision announced by the Government to supply, off the shelf, a more rugged vehicle to our troops is sensible, though not before time, and we must hope that those vehicles will be delivered soon. The better armour of a Mastiff, compared with a Land Rover, will help to save lives. No Government are entitled to expose our serving men and women to unnecessary risk. Furthermore, when our service men and women are injured, they should be able to expect the best medical treatment that we, a technologically advanced and wealthy country, are able to provide.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07102357000039"></a>During our visit, we were shown the medical facilities at Camp Bastion, which are also available to the local population. They are impressive, as is the commitment of the medical staff. Injured personnel, of course, need to reach those facilities quickly from the field and shortage of helicopters can be a problem. Moreover, when servicepeople return to the UK for further medical treatment, we need to ensure that not just the medicine but also their hospital environment are conducive to speedy recovery.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07102357000040"></a>As to whether the UK should be in Afghanistan, although our presence there has not been attended by anything like the controversy surrounding our presence in Iraq, it has not been free from it.  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1041"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1041</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Opponents often argue that no outside power has ever succeeded in Afghanistan and that NATO will not, either. That is fatalistic, pessimistic and false. The alliance is no invader. It is there at the invitation of the Afghan Government to assist in creating conditions of greater freedom, security and prosperity in that country. That involves combating terrorism, which threatens the Afghan people, this country and our allies. For these reasons, this side of the House supported and continues to support the intervention in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07102357000041"></a>Having committed ourselves, the UK must now succeed. The consequences of failure in Afghanistan, in the wider region and for the alliance itself are far too serious for it to be anything other than a first-order priority to give ourselves the best chances of success. I do not think that we have done that yet. Indeed, there is a widespread impression outside Afghanistan that the NATO military campaign is failing, which is mistaken, although it is possibly a result of the media sophistication of the Taliban. Our commanders are the first to warn of the dangers and they are not complacent. It is, however, a mark of their relative success that the Taliban has had to extend its tactics from fighting our troops to intimidating the civilian population with suicide bombing.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07102357000042"></a>The real problem lies in what follows&#151;or fails to follow&#151;a successful NATO military operation. If the Afghan armed forces and the local police are unable to provide a reasonable level of security and the Taliban can slip back in, as already happens, economic reconstruction and restoration of normal daily life cannot take place. That has potentially enormous costs in the battle for hearts and minds and the whole point of an operation can be lost. Training a sufficient number of Afghan soldiers to hold territory taken and raising local police standards are therefore key priorities.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07102357000043"></a>Problems lie on the civilian side, too. There are over 100 civilian agencies in Afghanistan with more than $100 million a year to spend. There are no fewer than 28 provincial reconstruction teams, led by different foreign Governments. Much good is being done, but differing methods of operation and different goals, combined with the absence of an overall strategy and effective high level co-ordination, mean much wasted and misdirected activity. We are a long way from helping the Afghans to generate a viable economy free of dependence on the narcotics that reach our streets.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07102357000044"></a>The huge international effort needs strategic direction under an individual with the experience and authority to pull the strands together and contribute to the creation of a really effective military-civilian nexus. Indeed, it has been well said by NATO military commanders that it can go in alone but not come out alone. The civilian side of post-conflict stabilisation is crucial to success and there has to be a joint effort between the military command and civilian agencies. In developing a comprehensive approach, NATO shows that it understands that. However, as NATO itself will acknowledge, implementation is far from mature. NATO also needs to be nimbler and less

I tell no secrets in pointing to the many layers of command, as well as to the long-standing problem of national caveats, which damage NATO&#146;s military effectiveness. Such issues will not find their solution on the ground in Afghanistan, but that country shows clearly how important their solution is to the long-term future of the alliance as an effective instrument of western security.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07102357000045"></a>It is not so much that we do not understand what needs to be done in Afghanistan; we have learnt much and the outline of what is needed is pretty clear. The difficulty lies in putting it into effect. We need to continue to work at getting a higher level of performance out of each of the elements of policy, while welding them together in a strategy that can be driven forward with vigour. This is not an optional extra; it is essential to success.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07102357000046"></a>We also need to be realistic about what we are trying to achieve politically and must not try to impose western notions of liberalism on a deeply traditional society. Instead, we should work with the grain of Afghan society in helping to open up opportunity to more of its citizens. I said earlier that if we were interested in success, we should not expect to leave Afghanistan soon. The British ambassador there was right when he said that it is not a sprint but a marathon. We need patience, perseverance and determination. What happens in Afghanistan is linked to the situation in Pakistan, which is not becoming less complex. That subject goes beyond the scope of my remarks today. However, it is clear that, among other things, closer co-operation between Islamabad and Kabul in countering terrorism is absolutely essential.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07102357000047"></a>In conclusion, I would like to say how important the success of NATO is, not only to western interests in Afghanistan but to the foundations of British foreign policy. As a young graduate, I was the fortunate recipient of a Harkness fellowship, which took me to the United States for two years. While I was there, the Cuban missile crisis took place. Anyone who lived through that has had it impressed on them how profoundly important our relationship with the United States is to our security. The world has been transformed since then, but it remains true for the United Kingdom that our capacity to act in the world still rests on the transatlantic link, at the core of which lies NATO.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07102357000048"></a>In a globalised world, we should not be surprised that we have much at stake in a country 3,500 miles from our shores. We must not shrink from the task that we have taken on, but we must get it right. The price of failing to do so will surely be greater than the effort that we need to put in to make it succeed. I thank the House for listening so patiently to this initial contribution to its deliberations.</p>

She has had an illustrious and diverse career in the service of her country, as a number of noble colleagues today have

With more than 30 years&#146; experience in Her Majesty&#146;s Diplomatic Service, in posts as diverse as Singapore, Washington, Brussels and Bosnia, to call on plus spells as the chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee as well as a BBC governor&#151;not, I hasten to add, at the same time, as I understand it&#151;I have no doubt that she will enlighten and enliven your Lordships&#146; debates for some time to come.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07102357000050"></a>I carry on more or less where the noble Baroness left off in turning my remarks to the work that we are trying to do in Afghanistan. I, like her, praise almost beyond my imagination the work that our Armed Forces have done there, whether they are regular service personnel or reservists. Their approach in establishing the early provincial reconstruction teams was both courageous and sympathetic. I ask noble Lords to imagine just handfuls of young soldiers working with the grain in vast tracts of Afghanistan&#146;s interior. Years ago, I saw for myself, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, did recently, the genuine friendliness of our young soldiers engaging with local communities. I can bear witness to their resourcefulness in helping to deliver humanitarian aid and development projects. Their commitment in holding fund-raising events among their own colleagues in their bases to pay for micro-projects such as a footbridge, a well or a classroom, built with the help of local villagers, pays tribute to the dedication of those young men and women.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07102357000051"></a>Those projects may hardly be noticed in the general scheme of things, and perhaps it is not so surprising that those young men and women are prepared daily to put their life on the line to preserve and protect what they are achieving on behalf of the Afghan people and in the service of their country. We should be proud of them and salute them and their families. We could start by ensuring that the commitment shown by these young people, some of whom are barely out of their teens, in our Armed Forces is not cheapened by inadequate developments, by the inadequate deployment of personnel and resources, or perhaps by the threat of a widening capability gap due to unreliable, ineffective or inappropriate weaponry, transport and communications systems. The case of the Mastiff armoured vehicle is classic; after so many years, we have eventually begun to get it right. With a 30 per cent increase in violent deaths in Afghanistan this year, rising from 425 a month in 2006 to 550 a month now, and with suicide and road-side bombing increasing at a similar rate, we must ensure that the efforts of our military personnel are not diluted, diverted or squandered through the failure to set realistic, achievable objectives in Afghanistan and the neighbouring region.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07102357000052"></a>The present objectives are well known but are worth repeating. In summary, they call for the elimination of al-Qaeda, the defeat of the Taliban and the development of a stable and democratic Afghan state. They also call for support for the Afghan Government and internationally sanctioned counter-narcotics efforts and for the provision of support for humanitarian assistance operations. However, there are concerns that the progress made on the political and development objectives does not match the military investment and commitment that  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1044"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1044</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we and our NATO allies are making. The question is why the coalition forces were unable to turn the initial military success into sustainable security and stability in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07102357000053"></a>The Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House has already been quoted in the debate. Its report is an important contribution to the analysis of how we can go forward. Its recent analysis shows that, although the operation suffers from a lack of resources and troops and has done in many people&#146;s eyes since 2003, there is a more fundamental difficulty: those involved in the coalition have in many cases failed to develop the coherent approach needed to achieve the coalition and NATO objectives in that country. In particular, a comprehensive strategy to address the political objectives&#151;the elimination of al-Qaeda, the defeat of the Taliban, and help for Afghanistan towards establishing a stable and democratic state&#151;seems to have been subsumed in a collection of partial and ad hoc schemes and perceptions. That is a major difficulty in varying the international, legal frameworks under which the contributing forces operate.</p>

<a name="71023-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07102357000054"></a>The national force deployments in Afghanistan are heavily constrained by restrictive caveats imposed by national Parliaments, as my noble friend Lord Lee of Trafford has already mentioned. Chatham House gives two classic examples, among many more. My noble friend Lord Lee has already mentioned one: Tornado aircraft collecting reconnaissance data under one hat but being unable to pass the data on to those who need them under the other hat. There is also Operation Medusa, during which Canadian ISAF forces were confronted by entrenched Taliban units in strength. The Canadian commanders apparently asked four allied partners for relief but not one helped. The commanders were turned down each time on the basis that the legal restrictions would not permit their allied partners to come to the Canadian forces&#146; aid. That is a farce and a fiasco.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07102357000055"></a>Those cases illustrate a serious difficulty with coalition operations in Afghanistan. Not all ISAF members, as many noble Lords have noted, are prepared to share the increased risks of military expansion in Afghanistan&#151;an unwillingness that reflects parochial domestic political pressures but presents a serious threat to NATO&#146;s future operations and perhaps to NATO&#146;s future itself. Helping Afghanistan to develop into a stable and democratic state is proving, if anything, even more daunting. The trends over time of increasing opium production are deeply depressing, as other noble Lords have noted. It is generally known that Afghanistan produces some 90 per cent of the world&#146;s illegal opium, according to the latest UN figures. Even more depressing is the fact that that 90 per cent is up from 70 per cent in 2000 and from just over 50 per cent in 1990. The trend continues unchecked. The narcotics trade continues to fund the warlords and their private armies. It continues to feed corruption in the civil administration and to nurture increasing criminality throughout the country. With disagreement within the coalition about the way forward in eradicating the poppy crops and providing equitable and viable

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07102357000056"></a>Finally, no serious commentator on Afghanistan believes now that achieving the objectives of the war as set out initially will result from actions solely within the borders of that country. The conflict has become and has been recognised as a regional conflict that desperately needs regional solutions. Recent events in Pakistan&#151;for example, the attempted assassination of Mrs Bhutto&#151;underline the volatility of the region, particularly in the frontier areas with Pakistan. Inevitably&#151;I am sure that the Minister will comment on this in his winding-up speech&#151;the frontier areas in Waziristan and other tribal agencies, which have been the seat of unrest for centuries, are where the solutions must be found.</p>

This is my swansong for my four-year cycle on that committee. I will then put some issues to my noble friend, of which I have given him notice, about the problems on the Iraq/Turkey border and how they interrelate to some of the problems of the internal evolution of democracy and human rights in Turkey. Some of us had the privilege of having discussions with the Turkish Prime Minister about that earlier this afternoon. I couple my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Roper, with thanks to the clerk of Sub-Committee C, Kathryn Colvin, who is happily with us in the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07102357000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, may think that I will try to be helpful on sub-committees, but I have to stop there with regard to his thesis that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark when it comes to our committee structure and the remit of the EU Committee and its sub-committees. Of course it has never been the case, whether on Africa, the Middle East or anywhere else, that we are focusing only on what the issue has got to do with the EU. I can well imagine the speech that the noble Lord would make if we did not concentrate on the scrutiny of the EU as our main rationale. After all, we pride ourselves&#151;do we not?&#151;on having a comprehensive structure to scrutinise the EU. I would have thought that the noble Lord would think that that is absolutely essential&#151;I refer to phrases such as &#147;Make sure they don't get away with anything&#148;, and to rhetoric of that kind.</p>

In committee it is often very salutary to say, &#147;Just a moment, we are not doing a report on the Russian economy or on the whole of Africa; we are doing a report on the role of the European Union&#148;. For  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1046"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1046</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, there is an important and growing role for the European Union in relation to development. The aim is that 10 African countries do not have 250 different pieces of advice about auditing or whatever. But it means that there has to be a bigger role for the EU on such external relations. There is a very long list that demonstrates the truth of that, whether it concerns energy policy, the environment or other such issues.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07102357000061"></a>I do not think that we need to shed too many crocodile tears over the EU being all over the place on policy matters such as the Middle East. I say &#147;crocodile tears&#148; because obviously&#151;to vary my metaphor&#151;charity begins at home. It is Britain, France and Germany that sometimes do not want the EU to act as a united front. I ask the noble Lord: where does that leave criticism? I do not ask him to respond to that this second but that is the nature of the balance that has to be struck. It would be retrogressive to advocate that the EU is simply going to be an exercise in intergovernmentalism. The noble Lord&#146;s criticism would then be logically even more cogent.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07102357000062"></a>The EU in this context is a member of the quartet, but it has not been a very proactive member. We concluded with some agreement over Javier Solana&#146;s remark that the EU sometimes needed to be two or three steps&#151;I think I have this right&#151;ahead of the United States. That is what the Arabs&#151;if I can put them all in one compartment, which of course is a dangerous thing to do&#151;would rather like. Noble Lords can read our remarks about the Mecca agreement in, I think, paragraph 180. We say that the agreements that the Arabs are struggling to put together&#151;they were making some progress&#151;rely on an interlocutor who is not so joined at the hip as are the United States and Israel. To follow on from that metaphor, I hope that my noble friend is recovering well from his hip operation; we look forward to him speaking from the Front Bench for many years to come.</p>

In other words&#151;the following conclusion is inescapable&#151;Israel&#146;s special relationship with the United States means that the EU would not have its own robust relationship with Israel but would trail along behind the United States.

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07102357000067"></a>There is scope for varying the geometry, as we found with the EU and Iran. At the moment, a crisis involving Iran is obviously emerging, and the EU will have to be very prominent in sorting it out. I want to mention something else that is rather obvious: the Israelis obviously have a nuclear bomb and the Iranians do not. I am not suggesting changing that in the direction of both having the bomb, but there should be a nuclear-free zone covering the whole of the Middle East. My noble friend may wish to comment, but I cannot see why that is not official UK policy. It is essential that we go in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07102357000068"></a>Before I sit down, I want to say a couple of words about Turkey and Iraq. I had the privilege two weeks ago of being in south-east Turkey in Diyarbakir, an area where the majority of citizens have a Kurdish background. The British Government have been very active in making positive contributions. I welcome the dialogue that I had with the Turkish Prime Minister, who is a considerable statesman. Nearly everyone who has met him in London believes that it is essential to make progress on the route of Turkey joining the European Union. Difficult issues that came up such as the terrorism laws and Turkishness laws must be set against the background that we very much want to find solutions. One danger is that action by the PKK and possible reaction by the Turkish generals could mean that these human rights questions are exacerbated.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07102357000069"></a>The dialogue must be a dialogue, without the Americans coming in again with hobnailed boots over the question of the territorial integrity of Iraq. No one is questioning the territorial integrity of Turkey, including parties with a Kurdish background. We must recognise that the DTP or something like it has a role to play, along with civil society organisations. We must get behind Mr Martti Ahtisaari, the High Representative and the team on the EU and Turkey to signal that we want to accelerate the progress of Turkey towards the European Union so long as there are signs of internal dialogue. I do not mean dialogue with the PKK. The terrorist outrages must be seen to be nothing to do with any party being allowed to put forward candidates&#151;as the DTP is now&#151;for the Turkish Parliament. It would be helpful to see how that positive strategy could be moved forward, as well as saying that we are totally against the terrorist outrages of the PKK.</p>

My noble friend Lady Warsi gave an eloquent and moving account of the plight of women in Afghanistan. She has tremendous expertise in Muslim affairs, which will be of great value in this House. She comes here with a high reputation for combative oratory, which anyone who has watched &#147;Question Time&#148; will know is well justified. She referred to the long line of distinguished ladies from Dewsbury who have arrived here. She is a very distinguished addition to their ranks already and we look forward to hearing her again.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07102362000003"></a>My noble friend Lady Neville-Jones also made a powerful analysis of Afghanistan, and I particularly agreed with two of her observations&#151;I am sure that everyone did. The first is that, having committed ourselves, we must see it through and, secondly, that it would be a terrible mistake to impose western liberalism on a traditional tribal society. I first knew her when she was in the Cabinet Office. Her experience there and as chairman of the JIC will be of tremendous value to this House. We look forward to hearing from her again as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07102362000004"></a>At Heathrow Airport, there is an advertisement for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which one always sees when one gets on board an aircraft. It says, &#147;Isn't it a good thing to see things from another person's viewpoint?&#148;. Then, as you walk down the gangway to the plane another poster says, &#147;Another person's viewpoint is simply the place where you are not&#148;. I am afraid to say that I was reminded of those posters when I listened to the Minister. Sometimes when we have debates on the Middle East we lose the ability to see things as people in other countries see them. We sometimes lose the ability to see how we are perceived in the Middle East. </p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07102362000005"></a>I hate to say this because it gives me no pleasure, but we are seen today through the prism of Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and rendition, and through the eyes of Al-Jazeera television programmes that are often made from the point of view of those on the ground who have to pay the price of invasion&#151;what we euphemistically call collateral damage.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07102362000006"></a>The phrase &#147;the war on terror&#148; has been a terrible mistake. If it were just a phrase it would still be a terrible mistake, because it is so easily confused or wrongly translated as a war against Islam. But it is a wholly wrong concept if the idea is to win hearts and minds and to divorce the passive supporters of terrorism&#151;those among whom the terrorists live&#151;from supporting it. You cannot wage war against a few individuals using all the weapons that demolish homes, kill children and cause collateral damage. When the Minister referred to the French aircraft that were going to be deployed in Afghanistan, I am sorry, but my immediate reaction was, &#147;I wonder how many homes they will bomb by mistake&#148;.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07102362000007"></a>The United States and many in Britain have made the mistake of carrying forward into the war on terror the same mentality that we had in the Cold War. The threat today is not a single ideology that is allied to a military superpower such as the Soviet Union. The threat that we face today is much more diffuse.  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1049"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1049</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sometimes people try to identify a threat by talking about the threat of a universal caliphate. Maybe  Hizb ut-Tahrir and Osama bin Laden fantasise nostalgically about the caliphate, but it is most improbable that it could ever be realised. For a start, Shia Muslims&#151;a large part of the Islamic world&#151;do not believe in the universal caliphate. Therefore, Iran, identified as the great danger in this debate, will not be pushing that concept. In fact, the idea of the universal caliphate was not so popular at the end of the First World War when it disintegrated among fighting between Turks and Arabs.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07102362000008"></a>We are not facing a war of civilisations but the threat posed by, I accept, a very large number of small groups of Islamic extremists who can mount terrorist attacks. They can kill innocent civilians, damage property and sting us into making inappropriate reactions. These people can murder but do not threaten the West&#146;s existence or our way of life. Combating them is a job for Special Forces and the police, both domestic and international.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07102362000009"></a>I accept that there is also a separate problem of nuclear proliferation. I agree with the Minister and my noble friend Lord Howell about the danger of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons which could destabilise the Middle East. It is a serious problem which, as my noble friend on the Front Bench said, has to be tackled with diplomacy and other measures. </p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07102362000010"></a>Unfortunately, our task has been made much harder&#151;as I think the noble Lord, Lord Lea, was hinting&#151;by the fact that we have turned a blind eye to the possession of nuclear weapons by countries that we regard as more favourable to the West. I agree with him that it would have been much better if, earlier on, we had devoted our efforts towards trying to create a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07102362000011"></a>The former Prime Minister, Mr Blair, made a speech last week in which he compared the situation in the Middle East with the rise of fascism in Europe in the 1920s. In the West, we have had new Hitlers several times. Sir Anthony Eden saw Nasser as Hitler, the Americans saw Ho Chi Minh as the equivalent of Nazi Europe and, not so long ago, Colonel Gaddafi was the latest Hitler figure. I am not sure that the former Prime Minister&#146;s remarks are entirely helpful if they are designed to solve the problem that we have with Iran&#151;a country, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester reminded us, which is highly factional and diverse, and which has a defence budget that is 1 per cent that of the United States.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07102362000012"></a>If Iran is Nazi Germany on the rise, it seems very strange that it made the offer it did in 2003 to rein in Hezbollah and Hamas, help America in Iraq and introduce transparency in the nuclear programme&#151;an offer rejected out of hand because America felt that it was on the offensive and had the advantage. Today, sadly, the psychology is the other way around.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07102362000013"></a>Nothing about Iran today can be understood without reference to the Iran-Iraq war. Trying to understand Iran without reference to that is like trying to understand modern Britain without reference to the two great wars. It is true that Iran displays a highly hostile attitude to Israel, particularly regarding Palestine. Iran has no legitimate involvement in the Palestine question,  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whereas one can argue that it has a legitimate interest in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Why does it maintain this policy towards Palestine and Israel? I believe it is for two reasons. First, if Iran is attacked, it knows that it cannot retaliate against the United States but it probably thinks that it could do so against Israel. It may be overestimating its own capacity in that regard. Secondly and more importantly, hostility against Israel stops Iran being isolated within the Gulf. Arab Governments are opposed to Iran but I regret to say that the President of Iran&#146;s stance&#151;outrageous that it is&#151;is tremendously popular in the Arab street. There would be no way more effective in undercutting Iran and isolating it than to make progress on the Palestinian question, which is why I hope that the Government will put renewed energy and vigour into that.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07102362000014"></a>Another threat identified in Mr Blair&#146;s speech in New York was the rise of political Islam, about which I would like to say a word. We have seen in recent years the rise of political Islam, sometimes called Islamism&#151;the belief that government should be based on the religion of Islam. It is perfectly possible to believe in political Islam without being a supporter of terrorism. There are terrorists who are Islamists but not all Islamists are terrorists.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07102362000015"></a>Islamism is a spectrum. There is a profound difference between the political Islam of Sunnis and Shias or the political Islam of Iran and Hamas. Throughout the Islamic world, religious parties have been advancing and advancing in democratic elections&#151;in Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, Palestine, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. William Dalrymple remarked the other day that democracy, not terrorism, has been the engine of political Islam.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07102362000016"></a>Religious parties often come to power, or increase their vote even if they do not come to power, because they are seen as representing justice and the interests of the poor. Often they are the alternatives to despotic or corrupt regimes as I think, to some extent, Hamas was seen as the alternative to corrupt Fatah. On several occasions, the West&#146;s response has been to reject the result of a democratic election, if it is the wrong one, as we decided it was in Palestine and in Egypt.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07102362000017"></a>While I agree with what the Minister said about human rights in Iran, he would have been more convincing if he had coupled it with a strong condemnation of human rights and the imprisonments of political dissidents in Egypt. We are far less vocal about countries that we regard as more in favour of ourselves.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07102362000018"></a>It may be that a religiously based state will be a stage that some countries pass through as they progress towards full democracy. There is no reason why the West should not exist with Islamic states. However, the great mistake that we hope we will avoid making is denying the results of democratic elections when they bring to power those of whom we do not approve. That is simply going to reinforce the Islamist trend and those who sometimes use the democratic process to protest against particular regimes.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07102362000019"></a>In the Middle East, as in Ireland, the shadow of history is a very long one. Today&#146;s children are paying for our grandparents&#146; mistakes. We have to be careful

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="07102362000020"></a><b><a name="71023-0011.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07102362000037"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> My Lords, somewhat to my surprise, I found myself in full agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, about the war on terror, Middle Eastern perceptions of the West and Islamic politics. However, I will not pursue these subjects but suggest that in approaching this timely debate&#151;for which many are grateful&#151;we should ask what the real interests of the United Kingdom, the United States and Israel are.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07102362000021"></a>The answer lies in a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, an end to conditions of war and non-recognition and, more widely, a reasonable balance of forces. If these aims could be achieved, it would be in the national interest of the three states that I have mentioned. It would mean that the Middle Eastern region could make a positive contribution to the rest of the world instead of being a permanent source of instability and violence. The proposed international conference at Annapolis may assist the bilateral and multilateral aims, provided that it respects existing realities. Here I agree strongly with my noble friend Lord Hannay, who is no longer present, that this means that Syria and Hamas should not be excluded. Both are too strong to be ignored. Syria is strategically placed and its Government show no signs of collapsing. Hamas enjoys solid popular support in both Gaza and the West Bank. A Palestinian Government of national unity could have continued successfully had it not been for the inept preconditions and quasi boycotts imposed by the external powers. I did warn against these mistakes at the time.</p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07102362000022"></a>It would be helpful to Annapolis and to the search for long-term peace if the pro-Israel lobby in the United States could be persuaded to show a degree of restraint. Its past failure to do so has meant that the Oslo agreements went unimplemented, that peace with Syria was not achieved, and that the opportunity of the Saudi and Arab League initiatives was missed. </p>

<a name="71023-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07102362000023"></a>I conclude by mentioning two small points which some might think insignificant. I suggest that together they could do much to improve the climate for negotiations. In Gaza, there are some 6,000 students who have places in foreign universities and institutions, many of them with scholarships attached. They are unable to travel because of the blockade and the closing of the crossing points. Surely it would benefit Israel to let them go to study rather than stay at home, disaffected and liable to be recruited into terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07102362000024"></a>The second point concerns the 10,000 or more Palestinians currently detained in Israel or who have been convicted by military courts. They include a few women and children, plus many members of the elected Palestinian Legislative Council. I welcome the release of 87 individuals in early October, but I suggest that a proper review mechanism is needed to assess length of detention, current attitudes and a whole range of humanitarian factors. Her Majesty&#146;s

A review mechanism which led to regular releases would give much hope. It would also be in Israel&#146;s interest by reducing the likelihood of its soldiers or officials being kidnapped.</p>

<a name="07102362000025"></a><b><a name="71023-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07102362000038"></a>Lord Eden of Winton:</b> My Lords, I cannot hope to emulate the most interesting tour de force of the Minister in opening this debate, but I will do my best to concentrate on three particular areas. I start with Iraq. Like my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford, I am disturbed by the way in which the reduction of our forces in Iraq was announced and how it appears it is about to be carried out. Surely we agree that there should be no premature weakening of our presence in Iraq. The position is still extremely fragile, but there are signs of hope, not least because of the way the Iraqis themselves are increasingly taking control over their own affairs. Obviously there is a long way to go, and we have a great responsibility for keeping our presence strong and effective, in particular by helping them to deal with insurgents, by holding the ring and continuing with the training of Iraqi police and military personnel, which our forces have done with such consummate skill and which is now extremely well established. What a tragedy it is for the people of Iraq that a Sunni/Shia struggle for power within Iraq is depriving them of the great opportunities which undoubtedly await them, if only they could settle their differences and manage their own affairs effectively.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07102362000026"></a>Turning to the Middle East as a whole, most commentators refer to the need to resolve the Palestine/Israel situation. I agree on the importance of achieving that, or at any rate of making further progress towards achieving it. No doubt the two-state solution does offer the best prospect for peace, but I do not think that that has any chance of coming about unless there is the prospect of a viable Palestinian state, and that in turn cannot come about unless Israel ceases the building of settlements and withdraws from the east of Jerusalem the settlements which it is in the process of establishing.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07102362000027"></a>It is also most important that we engage Syria as actively as possible in our discussions when referring to the Palestine/Israel settlements. Syria is an Arab League nation and should be closely involved in all the discussions. Perhaps the opportunity will arise during the next few days for the Government to encourage Saudi Arabia to renew the initiatives it showed a short time ago. Perhaps that nation can broker an arrangement with Syria to become involved in these discussions.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07102362000028"></a>However, the discussions are about to move to Annapolis in the United States of America, a city of which I have the honour to be a freeman and where one of my ancestors, the last colonial Governor of Maryland, is buried. We are not quite clear about what is going to happen in Annapolis, nor are we yet 100 per cent sure exactly who will be taking part in the discussions. Like the Select Committee, whose  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1053"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1053</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report is before us in today&#146;s debate and was introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, I suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on the possible role of Hamas. I know that it sticks in the throat to have to talk to people who have engaged in acts of violence, but throughout our history we have had to do that over and over. The time has come when Hamas needs to be drawn more openly and fully into the substantive discussions which the other countries are engaged in. I hope, therefore, that our Government will change their position on this point and encourage the involvement of Hamas directly in the Israeli/Palestinian summit to be held next month in Annapolis.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07102362000029"></a>I agree with those who have said that a solution to Iran must be found through diplomatic endeavour. On this point, to what extent is the Minister able to tell us about the position of Russia following the visit of Mr Putin to Tehran? Is there any encouragement coming from that quarter? Is there any prospect of a settlement on a diplomatic basis? I know that Russia was more interested in establishing a Caspian security arrangement and that the interest there lies in oil. But oil is not the only interest that Russia must have in Iran. Russia must also be anxious to ensure that a fundamentalist Islamist influence does not permeate from Iran further north towards Russia.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07102362000030"></a>While on the subject of Iran, I would like to say a word about the People&#146;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran. There is no justification to continue the proscription of the PMOI. It is not a terrorist organisation. We only went along with that in a form of appeasement to Iran which has done absolutely no good. The people of Iran are anxious for a settlement with the West. The mullahs of Iran may not be, but those who speak openly about the need for greater rapprochement with other countries in the Middle East from Iran deserve all the encouragement that we can give them. That certainly applies to the National Council of Resistance of Iran.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07102362000031"></a>My noble friend Lord Lamont referred to the long shadow of history. I agree with him that we all bear some responsibility for preserving an undue significance in those shadows. We all have the baggage of history on our shoulders, but even in the situation in the Middle East we can find hope if we can change the education policies of some of those countries. Perhaps this is a subject on which my noble friend Lady Warsi, whose brilliant speech was so moving, can make further contributions at some time. I think of the madrassahs in Pakistan, of the schoolbooks that are being used in Palestine right now and of the amount of preaching of hatred that goes on the whole time, more often than not in the name of religion. Education holds a hope for the future if we can get it right.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07102362000032"></a>Lastly, nobody can talk about the Middle East without talking about America&#146;s presence there. Without America there could be no prospect for any settlement anyway. I hope that American policy-makers can be less heavy-booted in their approach to these matters sometimes and not refer to everyone by the blanket label &#147;Islamists&#148;. People in Arab countries are as different as people in Western

The people of Iran are different from the people of Syria and Lebanon and elsewhere. As the noble and right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester said, what we need to bring about a settlement of these issues more than anything else is patience. He is right; we do need patience. But I would add one further word to that. We need both patience and tenacity.</p>

I was struck by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, whose words resonated with me over and over again, though at the very end&#151;and thinking of my colleague the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester&#151;I wondered whether what he was talking about will prove to be the case or whether it is a momentary blindness; I wondered whether religiously based states are a stage through which states will pass on the way to greater democracy or whether this is how things may be for centuries and in many other parts of the world as well.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07102370000005"></a>I appreciated the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Eden, about history and those of the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, about what we in our age may be laying up for our grandchildren, just as our grandparents&#146; generation laid up so much of the present situation. One thing that has surprised me in this debate is how little reference has been made to British responsibility in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s for so much not only of the boundaries but also of the character of the regimes that have preceded the present ones right across the area about which we have been speaking and how that has left people of all sorts in these countries viewing us in some rather particular ways as British people and British Governments.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07102370000006"></a>Some of your Lordships may have seen in the press that, in June, I wrote with two of my colleagues, the right reverend Prelates the Bishop of Exeter and the Bishop of Coventry, a letter to the Prime Minister as he came into office. With an eye on Annapolis and as people with different but long-standing interests in the Middle East, we wrote to see whether we could draw out of him his own sense of the essentials and vision for the region, particularly around Israel/Palestine, offering some of our own observations and conclusions. We began by supporting the commitment of the Prime Minister and the British Government&#151;although it is a much more widespread commitment, too&#151;to a two-state solution, although we noted the extent to which that was becoming, for a range of reasons, increasingly unviable, as the noble Lord, Lord Eden, has just said.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07102370000007"></a>We noted the speech that the Prime Minister made at the president&#146;s dinner of the Board of Deputies of British Jews on 25 April, in which he committed

In recognising the absolute right of Israel to exist, he called for people to work together for a two-state solution. We said that those were all sentiments with which the three of us wholeheartedly agreed. But we went on to note how on that occasion he had spoken of his understanding of the Hebrew word &#147;tzedakah&#148;, or justice and righteousness&#151;a great biblical word in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament. We said that it seemed to us essential to hold that word in mind and to encourage both Israelis and Palestinians to hold it in mind about each other. We wondered whether, in that connection, he had really seen, and allowed to enter deep into his consciousness, the character of the security wall and the way in which it was, as we put it, separating people from their land, isolating communities and acting as a significant element in impoverishing and pauperising a large part of the Palestinian communities.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07102370000008"></a>In that connection, I was intrigued a week or so ago to read in the press the comments of a UN official&#151;he probably should not have said what he was reported as saying&#151;who talked of recently briefing the previous Prime Minister in his present role on the situation in Israel and Palestine, particularly about the borders and the implications of the security wall and of the range of policies on both sides of it for the welfare and viability of Palestinians at present and in a future state. He said that he found Mr Blair both amazed and surprised by the briefings. This UN official then described how very surprising he found that, given the position that Mr Blair had been in for so long. Like my colleagues and many others, I believe that what is critical is an attempt to take in what is happening to Israelis and Palestinians in the present situation.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07102370000009"></a>It was intriguing to receive, in a letter dated 5 October, the Prime Minister&#146;s response, not least because it was so very much more positive, more engaged, more daring and more explicit than the Government&#146;s response to the EU Committee&#146;s document, which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, absolutely fairly said was bland and non-committal to a degree&#151;although I have said more than the noble Lord said, that is what I think he meant. The Prime Minister was very up front. He shared our vision and said that this was a rare moment of opportunity to take the peace process forward. He said that the US-led meeting in November will focus minds on a goal and that we really need to be up and at it and play a full part as the UK, and then within the EU and within the quartet.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07102370000010"></a>That led me to think that the Prime Minister had in mind some of the kind of things that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and his friends had very interestingly said in the committee&#146;s document. I confess that, as I only got hold of it today, I have only read portions of it, but other noble Lord&#146;s have noted significant portions. While supporting the position of the EU within the quartet and recognising the fundamental relationship with the United States, noble Lords are also saying that some independence of mind is required and necessary. There is a particular history

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07102370000011"></a>The Prime Minister went on to be much more explicit than what was in the Government&#146;s response. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07102370000087"></a>&#147;We share your concerns over the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102370000085"></a>He also said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07102370000088"></a>&#147;We continue to call on Israel to halt settlement activities and the construction of the barrier on Palestinian land&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102370000086"></a>It is important that we pick up the issues and encourage the Government to do so&#151;I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s winding-up speech in that regard&#151;with the greater sense of urgency that has found its way out into the media and the press in recent years about a situation that, for both Israelis and Palestinians, has elements that are simply terrible. We cannot be seen to allow it to continue until something better appears over the horizon.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07102370000012"></a>I return to the question of the viability of the Palestinian side of the two-state solution. Noble Lords may have recently seen in the press an energetic critique, which surfaces periodically in the work of NGO Monitor, the Jerusalem-based think tank, of the work of Christian Aid in the Occupied Territories. The critique is of a pair of Christian Aid documents in particular, one of which I re-read&#151;<I>Israel and Palestine: A Question of Viability</I>, a report published by Christian Aid in June this year&#151;having read NGO Monitor&#146;s material. This is not the moment to go into detail, except to say that I encourage noble Lords, if they are tempted to accept NGO Monitor&#146;s critique at face value, actually to read the document that it is critiquing. Having re-read the report, I do not find that the critique relates to the Christian Aid text with any real accuracy. More important, the report is worth reading because it is among the most valuable and&#151;from my experience, which is linked particularly to Bethlehem&#151;accurate summaries of what is now needed if the Palestinian side of the two-state solution is to be viable.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07102370000013"></a>I have already alluded to the fact that the committee is right to look for a greater sense of energy and initiative, both from the UK Government and in EU participation in the quartet, if the process is to be kept moving. Too much hangs on the whole situation in Israel/Palestine. While I value and agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, it is not good enough to say that that is the key to it all. I find when I talk to young Muslim people in Southampton that among the things that fire them&#151;and that, their elders fear, fire them very much when they watch Al Jazeera or whatever coming into their homes&#151;is the question of what is perceived across the Arab and Muslim world as a particularly profound injustice and dishonesty among western powers around Israel/Palestine. That is an urgent matter for us to address.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07102370000014"></a>I have been grateful that a number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Eden, have questioned&#151;as has the EU Committee, although in very diplomatic terms&#151;the wisdom of the exclusion of Hamas from the range of diplomatic activity. I would like to hear  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1057"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1057</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Minister on that subject. If the British Government are rightly arguing for probing, accurate and excellent diplomatic work with Iran, why are they not saying the same thing with regard to Hamas? I see no significant difference. As others have pointed out, so much in our history says that we have to talk to people. A meeting in Annapolis or anywhere else with such an utterly partial representation of Palestinians is a meeting set up to fail.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07102370000015"></a>I again underline the urgency of the situation. In Israel/Palestine, the Israeli state and hundreds of thousands of Israelis suffer seriously from the failure after so long of all sides, both internal and external, to find a resolution. From the Balfour Declaration onwards, we in the UK hold enormous responsibility for the whole situation through the mandate. I am struck that, whenever I speak about these things in Winchester, people tell me that they were there in 1946, 1947 and 1948 and speak about their experiences in that period. They ask why this process is taking so long and why we in the UK with our history and huge and onerous responsibility are not working much harder to resolve the problem. I am distressed and feel considerable anxiety and guilt at the thought that in recent years the international community has left this situation to fester, thus causing enormous damage to Israelis and still more to Palestinians. I hope that the Minister will commit to an energetic lead in working at these questions and will not let the problems just go on and on.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07102370000017"></a>We can debate the desirability of current military operations but we also have to examine the UK capacity to engage in them to the extent that we do. British defence planning assumptions allow for one medium-scale operation enduring&#151;medium-scale comprises a brigade of 3,000 to 5,000 men&#151;and one small-scale, comprising a battalion group of 600 men, possibly with naval support, and possibly enduring. The reality is that we are at double medium-scale plus and we have been doing this since 2003. This is a recipe for disaster. We cannot go on in this way.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07102370000018"></a>It is not just about the 24-month tour interval; it is about strategic assets supporting two operations when just enough for one is provided; it is about the rate of spares usage and refurbishment of platforms. More importantly, it is about training for war rather than just the war; the training and experience of senior officers and, finally, the ability to deploy on a large scale deliberate intervention at divisional level&#151;an LSDI.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07102370000019"></a>I have served on an LSDI called Op TELIC 1. Your Lordships will recall that it was militarily successful, but part of that success came from deploying on exercise Saif Sareea in Oman in 2001. But we cannot undertake another exercise Saif Sareea until at least 2015. The very time one questions the need for an LSDI capability is a few years before it is really needed. However, at that point the genuine LSDI capability has been lost and then we get our posterior kicked. The need for the LSDI capability

Does the Minister agree that we cannot engage in LSDI at the moment but that we need to maintain that capability?</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07102370000020"></a>I will not weary your Lordships explaining the perils of operating far outside defence planning assumptions for an extended period but they are very real. If any noble Lord thinks that US forces do not have this problem, he should think again. They do, but as with everything American, they have it on a bigger scale than we do. Clearly, we must either cut our commitments or massively increase our resources. Since no extra funds for defence or overseas operations are likely to be available on the scale required&#151;and in any case it would take too long to implement any enhancements&#151;we must cut our commitments.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07102370000021"></a>We cannot affect the outcome in Iraq, however hard we try. We have a small fraction of the forces deployed by the Americans. But we can affect the outcome in Afghanistan, especially if we concentrate our forces on that operation, rather than do too little everywhere. I leave it to the foreign affairs experts and party leaders to say where to concentrate our efforts, but I know what I would do.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07102370000022"></a>We should not reduce our forces in one area. We should close that operation completely. I did not know that my noble friend Lord Howell was going to put this point so well. On Iraq, he said that we should get in or get out. He rightly pointed to some of the risks of a small deployment. In principle, he is right. But, in reality, countering the risk of a large-scale attack could mean that our forces do very little other than exist in theatre. I have already undertaken to spare your Lordships a lesson in military logistics, but closing an operation completely is a lot different from reducing it. There are a lot more savings. But we must avoid the trap of withdrawing from Iraq completely and then redeploying all those forces to Afghanistan because of the long-term damage we are doing to our defence capability. We would be continuing to operate far outside of defence planning assumptions. If we continue to do that, we will encounter serious problems.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07102370000023"></a>There are two useful concepts for engaging counter-insurgency and peace support operations. They are effects-based operations and the comprehensive approach. Many noble Lords have referred to the lack of a comprehensive approach to current operations. Put simply, as a crude example, a desired end state might be a peaceful area of operations. The effect needed might be for the farmers who have turned guerrillas to leave that area. Two activities could have that effect. One is to bomb them&#151;a kinetic solution with all its attendant problems. The other is to put more resource into the aid effort by providing or repairing irrigation systems, and providing seeds and tools, so that the farmers will go home and do what they are good at. Of course, that is a civil activity and not a military activity, but you arrive at the desired end state of a peaceful area of operations.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07102370000024"></a>My concern is that while we might engage in effects-based operations at a low level, we certainly do not do a comprehensive approach at the strategic level in Whitehall and the UK. It is even more difficult to  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensure that we have a comprehensive approach at coalition level. The noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, referred to it as an elusive concept&#151;I think he was referring to a comment in a recent report. But that is not to say that excellent work is not being done in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Kajaki Dam project is a fine example. Money to improve the electricity supply comes from the USAID, but the security comes from British forces in Helmand province. The electricity will improve the lot of the ordinary Afghan and will be a tangible and obvious benefit of progress. It will drive a wedge between the reconcilable and irreconcilable Taliban, and will help to extend a writ of the Government of Afghanistan to all their country.</p>

<a name="71023-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07102370000025"></a>I know that there is a post-conflict reconstruction unit, but it does mean not that we have a comprehensive approach at the strategic level. Which Minister is in overall charge of current overseas operation? As far as I can see, there is not a Minister for Afghanistan or a Minister for Iraq. I believe that at one point Lord Longford was Minister for Germany. He was obviously running the whole thing, the comprehensive approach. We are not doing that at the moment. Theoretically, of course, the Prime Minister is in charge, but I suspect he is a bit busy with domestic policy.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07102370000026"></a>There is public dissatisfaction with both the aid and military operations in Afghanistan. This derives from unrealistic expectations of the rate of progress. There is no doubt that we will have to maintain a military presence in Afghanistan for at least a decade, maybe longer. This is not a prophecy of failure; it is the nature of problem. In Helmand there is a considerable need for reconstruction and development, but it is difficult to implement reconstruction without improving security. However, it is very hard to improve security until the local population reject the Taliban.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07102370000027"></a>Yes, we can militarily engage the Taliban, but this has its own problems, and Taliban body count is not a measure of success. It will be a slow process to put some security in place in Helmand, in order to facilitate some reconstruction, in order, then, to get some freedom of manoeuvre for the military. There is no doubt that the British public expects there to be some great event in Afghanistan, whereby the Taliban will be defeated. Of course, that will not happen. It will be a slow process to drive that wedge between the reconcilable and irreconcilable Taliban, and to marginalise the irreconcilable.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07102370000028"></a>Some noble Lords might think that the MoD is failing in its media operations; nothing could be further from the truth. MoD press officers produce good and accurate stories for the media; the problem is that the media simply do not run them. The stories are there but they do not use them.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07102370000029"></a>Many noble Lords are concerned about drug production in Helmand. The Minister gave a frank account of the current situation. Opium cultivation is an indicator of a lack of proper government. The writ of the Government of Afghanistan does not extend to those areas of cultivation. Our forces certainly do not have freedom of manoeuvre in those areas, which  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1060"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1060</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>presents problems for the Government. It is important to remember that opium eradication is not a military task. However, the UK does lead on drugs policy within the coalition.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07102370000030"></a>There are several schools of thought regarding eradication. Some think that it is easy. It is not. Any eradication has to be carefully targeted. If a farmer is up to his neck in debt, his land is poor and his poppy crop is destroyed, he will be driven into the arms of the Taliban. We would hope that he would be only a reconcilable member, but he would be in the hands of the enemy none the less. On the other hand, where a greedy farmer grows poppy on land that can easily support legitimate crops, targeted eradication may be beneficial, not least because it would increase the risk of cultivating poppy, rather than legitimate crops.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07102370000031"></a>Aerial spraying would be disastrous. It is very effective at destroying the poppy, and is favoured, unfortunately, by the Americans, but spraying is indiscriminate and might damage legitimate crops. Worse, Taliban propaganda would claim that the chemicals in the spray cause infertility and birth defects. We have heard about how effective Taliban propaganda is. We would lose hearts and minds. Increased poppy production is disappointing, but it is not a driver for our efforts in Afghanistan. When we can get the writ of the Government of Afghanistan to extend across the country, and their police force is effective and honest, we can expect opium production to fall.</p>

I agree with a great deal of what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said in his thoughtful opening speech. It has been helpful to tie in the valuable EU Committee report on the Middle East peace process with this debate. We have had two excellent maiden speeches. I was especially interested by the references of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, to women&#146;s rights, an issue that she is fully engaged in. It is also an issue in this country. Last Friday night, in Bradford, I was interested to hear about a speech that she had given last week on the role of the Braderei, a Kashmiri community in west Yorkshire. I would love to talk further about that with her.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07102370000033"></a>We also had a very interesting maiden speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, who was referred to as a distinguished and senior Foreign Office official. When I first met her, she was a distinguished but junior Foreign Office official. I am trying to remember whether it was 1974 or 1975 when she first briefed me on foreign policy co-operation among EU member states, when I was myself only a junior researcher at Chatham House. We look forward to many further contributions from her.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07102370000034"></a>There are many larger issues underlying this debate, some of which have been touched on by several other speakers. The first is what lessons we can draw on liberal intervention&#151;the doctrine that our former Prime Minister expounded in his Chicago speech; that underlay a number of UN documents such as the Canadian report and others; and that, in  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the more ambitious neo-conservative strategy, proposes transforming the Muslim world into democracies&#151;that is, both Tony Blair&#146;s assumption that we could harness American power to a progressive moral international mission and the Bush Administration&#146;s assumption that a coalition of democracies under American leadership could police and reshape the world.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07102370000035"></a>We have now discovered the limits of military power and military intervention. Iraq has become a quagmire because we did not think through the extent to which military intervention can be only part of an attempt to reconstruct a state and to assist in redevelopment. In Afghanistan, we find ourselves now caught in the contradiction between fighting the Taliban, state building and economic reconstruction. We are state building in a country where many parts never really had a state and where, for example, the power of Kabul never played a large role in Helmand.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07102370000036"></a>We now know that there are limits to what the Atlantic allies can do alone. We need to work with others&#151;China, Russia, India and even Iran&#151;if we are to achieve peace and stability in the area. There are also lessons for the special relationship. I very much support the underlying argument in the EU Committee report that, on the Middle East peace process, we need more Europe and less of following the American lead. The United States has, after all, now been the dominant power across the Middle East for 50 years; the sponsor of Israel; the ally and external supporter of authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and, until 1979, of the Shah&#146;s regime in Iran. Sadly, under the Bush Administration much more than under its predecessors, it has become clear that American policy towards the Middle East is driven much more by domestic lobbies and by ideology than by careful consideration of national interest and international order, and by a deliberate attempt in the US to suppress intelligent and independent analysis of the complex politics of the Middle East region. As an academic and political scientist, I have a great deal of sympathy with some of those in the United States who have felt the political pressures to limit their analyses of the Middle East.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07102370000037"></a>For example, the American attitude to Iran since 1979 has been fixated on the Iranian threat while at the same time forgetting how the United States has looked to Iranians since the 1953 coup. No American I speak to appears to be aware that the United States shot down an Iranian airliner some 20 years ago, or that the United States actively supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, or that Iranian nationalism is as important as fundamentalism or anti-Americanism in Iranian attitudes to the United States. As other noble Lords have said, that leads to American approaches to Iran which, because of that underlying sense of aggression, are far more fundamentalist&#151;one has to use the term&#151;than American approaches to North Korea.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07102370000038"></a>Then, there is the capture of American policy by the Israeli right through other domestic lobbies. That has also had an unfortunate effect on American policy, in which we see the American commitment to democratise the entire Middle East somersaulting

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07102370000039"></a>There are lessons for the importance of religion in global politics, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester told us. Radical Islam is now a religious ideology that has replaced Marxism as the rationale for the excluded and the alienated across the world&#151;and in this country. There is great importance, therefore, in how we in the non-Islamic world respond to that challenge. There is a dangerous tendency within the United States to see this conflict as a long war between civilisations, and against an implacable and unchangeable enemy. It was a great mistake for our former Prime Minister Tony Blair to feed that tendency in his speech to the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York, using the language of fascism to categorise Islam&#151;&#147;Islamo-fascism&#148;, which means that they are totally irrational and that we cannot deal with them. There are, after all, four states in the world with religious legitimacy as their primary foundation: the Vatican, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. I suppose that we ought now to add a fifth: the current regime in Iran. Four of those five are in the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07102370000040"></a>We have to be concerned to promote modernisation through necessary compromise between faith and toleration, or between moral certainty and democratic diversity, which we have painfully achieved in this country, and which has been achieved across other states in Europe, sometimes in our own lifetime. Indeed, we forget how recently some of those developments took place in this country. In the first general election of 1974, I remember Father Kelly taking me round the Catholic clubs in Manchester Moss Side and, before we went in, telling me that I had to understand that we would be distinguished by a number of things. First, we would be the only ones there who were not drunk; secondly, the only ones who did not claim to have cousins in Long Kesh; and, thirdly, the only ones who did not believe that the IRA was entirely right and the British Government entirely wrong.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07102370000041"></a>We have moved on from that and now see&#151;or sometimes claim to see&#151;the fundamentalist Muslim challenge. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said, we have to be concerned with the evolution of an Islamic version of democracy. Perhaps in Europe, where we have our own substantial population of Muslim citizens, that is part of what we will now, slowly and painfully, see develop.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07102370000042"></a>There are also lessons for the future of NATO at stake in Afghanistan. How many troops does NATO really need? How many more will the United Kingdom provide, as we draw down in Iraq, alongside the dribble of extra forces from the new NATO states? We will fail in Afghanistan if this becomes a war rather than a mission in which economic and political reconstruction are central. We will fail if we cannot constructively engage Iran in Iraq as well as Afghanistan, or persuade Pakistan to control its own radical Muslim groups. Some of those are linked to the military and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07102370000043"></a>I read an interesting article over the weekend in <I>Survival</I>, the IISS journal, which referred to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as &#147;passive sponsors of terrorism&#148;&#151;and interestingly compared them, as an American author did, to the United States as a passive sponsor of the IRA. I hope that the Government will make it clear to the Saudis during the state visit that we need much more active support from their regime than we have seen so far on the debate within Islam and on support for liberalising processes in the region.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07102370000044"></a>A number of noble Lords have spoken about the importance of the Annapolis conference and prospects for peace. There are real dangers of another half-hearted initiative on this issue ending in betrayed hopes and failure. I have read various worrying reports in the American press that President Bush is not fully committed to this initiative and that domestic lobbies are mobilising in Congress against it. We have, after all, had 40 years of Israeli occupation of Palestine, interrupted by the brief hopes and disengagement of the Oslo process in the 1990s. The situation in occupied Palestine is not stable. There are new Israeli settlement plans east of Jerusalem. Gaza is being strangled. The West Bank economy is sinking. The most recent edition of <I>Survival</I> has a depressing but persuasive article by Yezid Sayigh of King&#146;s College London. The title says everything:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07102370000089"></a>&#147;Inducing a Failed State in Palestine&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102370000045"></a>That is the direction we are going in, and if the state fails, we will have civil war, disorder and external terrorism. We also have weak government in Israel, with a populist Right, some Jewish fundamentalists and an active and unhelpful settlers&#146; movement. We have to hope that former Prime Minister Blair will not end in the same depressed state of mind as James Wolfensohn and Alvaro de Soto, who wrote despairing final comments on the failures of their missions.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07102370000046"></a>We all understand the outlines of the only acceptable framework for peace and stability&#151;two viable states with agreed boundaries and a special status for the holy places of Jerusalem. The long-term security of Israel depends on the achievement of such a framework. Those of us who see ourselves as friends of Israel find it difficult to defend it as strongly as we would like, as long as new settlements are under way, as long as internal barriers multiply within the occupied West Bank and the blockade tightens around Gaza, or as long as there is a culture within the Israel Defence Force that permits the ill-treatment of Palestinians, as <I>Haaretz</I> reported last week. We understand that there are many, many weaknesses on the Palestinian side within Fatah and Hamas, but we understand also that one has to deal with unpleasant people if one wants to achieve peace.</p>

<a name="07102370000048"></a><b><a name="71023-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07102370000097"></a>Lord Malloch-Brown:</b> My Lords, forgive me if my reply is not comprehensive in answering all the points raised. I would need much more than the allotted time and would keep all noble Lords here long past a decent time. I begin by joining all those who have welcomed two remarkable maiden speeches, which offered, as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said, two very different but equally interesting perspectives on Afghanistan. Listening to those complementary but different views, I wondered whether I started to see a broad tent billowing on that side of the House.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07102370000049"></a>I have tried to organise my responses by country, rather than by responding individually to each point made by noble Lords. I shall try to cluster what has been said under country headings. I shall begin with Afghanistan. The issue I will address first is poppy cultivation. The noble Lord, Lord Howell and several others said that it is time to try licit cultivation. The issue was raised in this House just before the summer and, as a consequence, I met with the head of the Senlis Council to explore the idea further and made deep inquiries into the experience in Afghanistan with schemes of that kind. Indeed, I revisited the issue when I was there last week.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07102370000050"></a>Aerial spraying is the only other strategy which unites people as forcefully against it as licit cultivation, and I heard from the military, the NGOs and my colleagues in the Foreign Office why it would not work. First, unlimited experimentation in the past had gone disastrously wrong and conditions that would allow the successful transfer of illegal production into a legal channel were completely absent. They had the view that all it would do was add to the total volume of production. With a new, second and legal client, people would just grow more. There would not be the framework of policing and law to ensure that the only growth was for legal use. Secondly, because of the very difficult situation in Helmand province, where communications are difficult owing to the insurgency, it was felt that such a policy would send dangerous mixed signals: first, you were told not to grow and then you were told that you could grow under certain circumstances. The view was that it would muddle the message. Thirdly, many experts in drug eradication have confirmed that while Afghanistan is a world market-beater in illegal cultivation, the growth of legal poppy for medicinal uses is already a crowded market. A number of growers are producing more inexpensively and there is just not the additional demand. People who have taken a very hard look at the issue believe it would not work.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07102370000051"></a>Equally, from President Karzai downward and outward to all the foreign partners, except the United States, there is a similar objection to aerial spraying, which is the other radical break with policy proposed. In my view, that does not mean that we muddle along

There is a need for much greater imagination in our eradication efforts.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07102370000052"></a>I am pleased to say that DfID is looking at whether we can put on a more formal and structured long-term basis what one would controversially describe as an Afghan equivalent of a CAP, with subsidised purchase of legal crops to make returns more like those from poppy.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07102370000053"></a>We have to do a much better job of not targeting the farmers, the producers whose hearts and minds we are trying to win in the counter-insurgency effort. We have to target the industry above that&#151;the financiers, the shippers, the drug big-men who are benefiting from the production. We know who they are and the Government of Afghanistan know who they are. A system banning them from travel, listing them and freezing their bank accounts, hitting at the industry&#146;s infrastructure, strikes me as an area in which more can be done. I spoke to the ISAF commander while I was there and he recognises&#151;it is more broadly recognised&#151;that, as drugs and insurgency wrap their limbs around each other, there is a need to break that link by targeting the factories and laboratories via military action if necessary, to take out the infrastructure, and not by targeting the farmers. I take the point that we need to do more and to look hard, because the trends in production figures are simply not satisfactory. We cannot sustain them.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07102370000054"></a>I want to ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, understood the point I made earlier that some provinces&#151;where there is the rule of law, where there are development alternatives and where the writ of government runs&#151;have reached the point at which they are not producing any opium. That is unfortunately more than offset by the jump in production in Helmand. We see these double trends in the country, and there is no doubt that the post-insurgency conditions of stable government and peace are the environment in which we can finally lick the problem. We must therefore win the battle with the insurgency in Helmand. On that point, the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, referred to the difficult geography of Afghanistan. I agree. Each time I fly over that country, I think, &#147;Is this really a country?&#148;, with its extraordinary valleys surrounded by mountains, making it very difficult both for military operations and for creating any sense of nationhood.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07102370000055"></a>Helmand is an area in which, despite the heroic efforts of our troops and a lot of tactical military successes for them, we are not yet prevailing in the broader strategic battle because we have been unable to move in behind those successes the kind of Afghan-led civilian-political effort that would capitalise on them to win back ordinary villages to the government side. As recently as today, President Karzai and I agreed on that analysis. There is a sense that the Taliban are a long-term insurance policy for people&#151;a sense of security after this Government fail. We must reverse that pessimism and sense of transience in Afghan politics, and persuade the ordinary people of Helmand that we, this Government and democracy are here to stay to support them for as long as they need.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1066"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1066</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71023-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07102370000056"></a>On that point, reference has been made to this being a long-term commitment. We in the Government do indeed view this as a long-term commitment, but one that must have clear benchmarks and make the transition over time from the military activity of today to a civilian support mission where there is a role for military training but where British men and women are no longer in the front line fighting someone else&#146;s war. We must allow Afghans to take on that lead role. We will be there for a long time, but the role must change.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07102370000057"></a>So to the point about troop levels. We do not see a great jump in troop levels. We do not think that anything like the numbers that have been traditional in counter-insurgency operations are possible to achieve in Afghanistan. It is enormously important that, from now on, an enhanced political effort is the main thrust that prevails in this conflict. That effort must be backed by military action, but there would be no dramatic growth in troop levels. There is no appetite for it among our allies. Britain is already the second biggest troop contributor. Yes, we can supplement modestly what is there, but we cannot make the dramatic jumps in troop levels about which some have talked. In the same way, a question was asked about our Apache helicopters. There is a worldwide shortage of helicopters for operations of this kind today. I am out there looking for helicopters for Darfur as well as for Afghanistan, and I can confirm that there ain&#146;t many around. They are a very versatile instrument for these kinds of activities.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07102370000058"></a>In the interests of time, let me move on from Afghanistan, but not without again praising our troops there, as the noble Baroness did. Like her, I have just seen Fort Bastion, which is remarkable evidence of our commitment and the quality of our efforts there.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07102370000059"></a>I turn next to Iran. I confirm the view of those who have said that Iran has a sense of besiegement. It feels that it has powerful enemies and that, in that sense, it is forced to strike back. But let us not feel sorry for little Iran because it is also a major force in its region, and a not altogether friendly one. Through little effort on its own part it has won two massive strategic successes that nobody wished to give it. The first is the emergence of a Shia Government in Iraq and the second is the overthrow of its old enemy the Taliban in Afghanistan. Iran has never been better blessed than today with the neighbours that western policy has helped put in power in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71023-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07102370000060"></a>However, rather than quitting while it is ahead and recognising that it has been played a very lucky hand by the fate of geopolitics, Iran, as I said earlier, cannot resist perhaps going a bridge too far in its activities across the border into Afghanistan and across the border into Iraq; in both cases, it is smuggling in weapons to tactical allies it has made there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07102370000061"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary repeated what was said by the previous Foreign Secretary on whether the UK is committed to not using force. I do not think he used his words, but he said that we are absolutely committed to a diplomatic track on the nuclear issue. We have, however, warned  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Iran directly and through intermediaries&#151;I have done it myself in a number of ways&#151;that we will not tolerate attacks using Iranian weapons on our troops in either Afghanistan or Iraq. Just a few weeks ago we tracked another shipment of very dangerous explosive weapons from Iran into Afghanistan. These activities pose a real risk to Iran and we urge them to resist these behaviours.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07102370000062"></a>As I have said, we are committed to the diplomatic track on the nuclear front. It has been asked tonight whether Russia is as well. Russia has supported two Security Council resolutions on sanctions and is committed in principle to supporting a third, the negotiation on which has begun. President Putin, as was remarked, visited Iran. He went there to try to press the case for Iran complying with the Security Council. I think that there is no doubt that Russia recognises that Iran with nuclear weapons poses as much danger to Russia as to anyone in Europe. It is right that at times its tactical approach has differed from ours. In part that is addressed by Russia wanting to be given a leadership role in this regard.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07102370000063"></a>As to whether there could be a nuclear-free zone embracing the whole region, in a sense we are where we are today. I add a second point: in a sense it is the undermining of the NPT over many years and our failure to have an effective global strategy on nuclear non-proliferation which forces us into so many difficult regional situations of this kind. We have no global framework within which to deal with this dangerously accelerating rate of nuclear proliferation around the world.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07102370000064"></a>I now turn to Iraq and to the point raised first by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, and then by others later in the debate, about &#147;stay in or get out of Iraq, but don&#146;t be half in&#148;&#151;to paraphrase what the noble Lord said. He particularly raised the example of whether with 2,500 troops by next spring and if one battle group were otherwise engaged we could defend ourselves at Basra airport. The number has been carefully planned on the military side, and the run down to coincide with the point at which Iraq will have 35,000 troops of its own, and, therefore, we believe will be a more than adequate partner to us.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07102370000065"></a>This approach has also been confirmed by General Petraeus, among others, as militarily do-able. But as the Prime Minister insisted, this will be a matter of military not political judgment. If there has to be any adjustment in time lines, there will be. We will not leave our troops exposed, but we want to move them to this overwatch and training support mission as quickly as we reasonably can.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07102370000066"></a>I hasten to reassure the noble Lord that relations with Washington are in good shape. Although there has been press speculation about the visit of the Foreign Secretary, he was only one of three Cabinet Ministers to have visited in the past few days, along with many senior officials. Plenty of contacts are going on at the moment and we do not need to be concerned, except in the sense that has been properly raised by so many speakers in the course of tonight's debate. As is appropriate between two old and good friends, we have some significant differences of

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07102370000067"></a>Before leaving Iraq, I have one clarification of what I said at the beginning. I said that we had committed &#163;90 million to southern Iraq, implying that that had just happened. In fact that is the total of what has been spent and committed since 2003.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07102370000068"></a>Turning to Turkey, Iraq and the PKK, the Prime Minister of Turkey has been here today. I do not yet have a full read-out of his discussions with the Prime Minister, but let me just say, as the Foreign Secretary said in a statement after the PKK attacks, that we condemn them. More particularly, we urge Turkey not to fall into the trap of doing exactly what the PKK would want by making a military incursion into Iraq. At this point, I praise the Governments of Turkey and Iraq, particularly the Government of Turkey, for showing a self-restraint from which many countries could learn.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07102370000069"></a>We are still in the early stages of Martti Ahtisaari&#146;s negotiations, and I do not want to comment further than to say that there could be no better negotiator for a task of this kind. I am confident that whatever direction he chooses, it is one with which we will all be comfortable.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07102370000070"></a>I turn in these last minutes to the Middle East proper, to which I do not want to give short shrift. Several speakers raised the issue of a more robust UK policy. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, talked of needing to get to grips with the real issues of refugee return, frontiers, the status of Jerusalem and so forth. Those who have been involved in Middle East peace negotiations seem to be of the view that last time the negotiators arrived at the final summit having postponed those issues, believing that they were too hard to tackle in advance. The consequence was that they remained too hard to tackle at the final negotiation.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="07102370000071"></a>Obviously, there is a sense that there are a lot of unresolved issues as we come to Annapolis. Those who see it as just the first meeting may sadly be proved right, but some of those coming to Annapolis hope for a breakthrough to make it a significant event. We all welcome the heavy engagement of the US in the run-up to this meeting. We may wish that it had been possible earlier, but we all agree that it is better late than never and are glad that it is now possible for the US to apply focus to the task.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07102370000072"></a>I come to Hamas and Hezbollah and whether the British Government, or indeed the UN, should deal with them. In the case of Hamas, there have been contacts with both and British diplomats have been heavily engaged with negotiating the release of hostages such as Alan Johnston. They have been heavily involved in humanitarian discussions, as were UN officials under both this and the last secretary-general.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="07102370000073"></a>The line has been drawn at formal political contacts at a time when Hamas refuses to recognise a sovereign member-state nation of the United Nations, Israel. However, I think that everyone agrees that while that political recognition must be withheld, in  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terms of negotiations with Hamas at the formal political level, contacts are vital. Over time, they must grow into full political contacts because, ultimately, Hamas must be a party to a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian problem.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="07102370000074"></a>Many of the same arguments apply to Hezbollah. We can abhor&#151;as we all do&#151;the tactics of both organisations and the use of violence and terrorism. Ultimately, as has been said, it is indeed British history&#151;and that of the United Nations&#151;that you often have to talk to people that you do not like very much.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07102370000075"></a>Let me welcome again the UN report. If we were not robust enough in it in the eyes of the right reverend Prelate and others, let me say that if time allowed me to be robust enough, I would very forcefully&#151;and with, I hope, as much enthusiasm as my Prime Minister&#151;endorse the urgency, the support to a two-state solution, the plea to Israel to stop settlement and barrier activities which make that harder, the plea to the Palestinians to put aside any rocket attacks on Israelis at this time and the plea to both sides to come to the table and negotiate a comprehensive peace. It is British diplomacy&#146;s objective to support that.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07102370000076"></a>I would only observe that we are not quite the front-line player that we sometimes in this House make the mistake of assuming we are. We are not a member of the quartet. We can do important tasks but others lead on much of this issue and we should and must support them.</p>

<a name="71023-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07102370000077"></a>Let me close by saying two things. First, I think that sometimes, as in the HSBC ads referred to by the noble Lord, we are guilty of looking at issues from one side only and not as comprehensively from the other side&#146;s point of view as we should. That does not mean that we should not do what it takes in Afghanistan to defend its Government. Therefore, I am pleased about those French Mirages. Nevertheless, I accept his broader point that recent years have been terribly damaging to British standing and we have to repair that in all the ways we can. They have done great damage to the concept of liberal intervention.

I am sorry not to be able to do justice to his argument at the tail end of a debate in which I have already run over time, but let me just say that I concur completely with the idea that no longer is interstate peace and security a matter for state actors alone. We are seeing a dramatic rise of non-state actors, not only of religious communities and their leaders, but also secular communities and their leaders. All of them are shaping our world in a way that traditional foreign policy often has difficulty getting its hands around. Much of that shaping is for good, but sometimes it is for bad. It is enormously important that the right reverend Prelate has reminded us of those non-traditional dimensions to the issues we confront in this Chamber when dealing with areas such as the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="07102326000009"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07102326000100"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Partnership and Co-operation Agreement) (Republic of Tajikistan) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000010"></a>The noble Baroness said: This order is a necessary step before the UK can ratify the EU/Tajikistan Partnership and Co-operation Agreement. UK ratification of the EU-Tajikistan Partnership and Co-operation Agreement will contribute to strengthening EU engagement with central Asia through implementation of the EU strategy for the region and the work of Pierre Morel, EU special representative. Ratification and implementation of the PCA will mark a step change in the EU's relations with Tajikistan and will help address concerns that the EU lacks profile in the region.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000011"></a>Our key interests in Tajikistan, which are also a focus of EU and other donor activity, are counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism, given the involvement of Tajik nationals in radical Islamist movements in Afghanistan and central Asia, and the promotion of good governance, human rights and sustainable development. Since 2004, the region has seen a retreat from democracy and relations with the West. Russia, China and Iran are playing a greater role, including in Tajikistan. There is a need for greater co-operation between the five central Asian states as well as with Afghanistan and beyond. This is a focus of EU and other donor activity.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000012"></a>The Partnership and Co-operation Agreement&#151;PCA&#151;sets out the political, economic and trade relationship between the EU and Tajikistan, instituting the basis for a regular political dialogue, co-operation in a wide range of areas and trade and investment. The PCA is a mixed agreement, covering some matters falling within the competence of the  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European Community and others within the competence of the member states. It is concluded for an initial period of 10 years.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000013"></a>The PCA aims to promote democratic reforms, economic growth, sustainable development and action against poverty. It also includes model clauses on action against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to standard clauses on human rights.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000014"></a>Ratifying this agreement would enable the EU to put its relations with Tajikistan into a comprehensive legal framework which will boost current co-operation, allow wider trade and economic relations and strengthen EU influence in promoting good governance and human rights in Tajikistan at a key stage in its own development. It would help the EU to compete with the growing influence of Russia, China and Iran, which are also contributing to the development of Tajikistan's infrastructure and energy sector.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000015"></a>Tajikistan is both the poorest country in central Asia and one of the most strategically placed, bordering Afghanistan. The Tajiks co-operate with the EU on counter-narcotics, participate in Partnership for Peace and support coalition efforts in Afghanistan. Tajikistan needs EU assistance more than most, as civil war and the drugs trade have significantly disrupted its development.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000016"></a>As regards UK-specific assistance, our growing DfID programme has spent more than &#163;10 million since 2003, focused on community development, judicial reform, encouragement of the private sector and HIV/AIDS. In addition we have spent more than &#163;2 million on helping the Tajik border forces to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border, promoting the development of civil society and democratic reform, and addressing the threat of conflicts through HMG's Global Conflict Prevention Pool.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000017"></a>The European Commission spends about &#8364;33 million per year in Tajikistan. From an initial focus on humanitarian aid, it has moved to a significant programme of technical support and is established as a key partner alongside Russia, China and the US. Fifteen per cent of heroin trafficked from Afghanistan transits Tajikistan to Russia. This has a profound negative effect on young people, disrupts the economy and encourages corruption. Through the EU's border management programme, HMG have supported efforts to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border and we work closely with Tajikistan's drugs control agency.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000018"></a>The EU strategy for central Asia, adopted in June, raises the profile of central Asia within Europe and paves the way for an expansion of our activity in the region, both bilaterally and regionally. In Tajikistan, President Rahmon has consolidated his power and is looking for support to take the country forward out of poverty and dependence. Ratification would strengthen the EU's ability to influence the direction that the president will take.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000019"></a>A priority for the UK and a significant part of the EU strategy for central Asia focuses on strengthening respect for human rights. We will look to the Tajik Government to work with us and the EU to implement the principles of good governance and transparency to facilitate trade, economic relations

<p><a name="07102326000020"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Partnership and Co-operation Agreement) (Republic of Tajikistan) Order 2007. <I>24th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="07102326000021"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07102326000101"></a>Lord Astor of Hever:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining the order. If passed, it will declare that the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the European communities and member states and the Republic of Tajikistan, signed on 11 October 2004, is to be regarded as a Community treaty as defined by Section 1(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. Therefore, Members of the Committee are today undertaking the second stage of a parliamentary ratification of that agreement. Of course, it has already been agreed in another place. I should make it clear from the start that we on these Benches have no objection to the proposal in principle. However, given that we are today agreeing a treaty, it is important to ask the noble Baroness some questions about the practical implementation.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000022"></a>This treaty contains measures to strengthen the EU's trade, economic and political relations with Tajikistan. It also contains a number of additional measures covering human rights, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, all of which are important subjects. Tajikistan is one of the last constituent republics of the former Soviet Union to have its agreement with the EU ratified. There has already been a series of these agreements with former republics of the Soviet Union. I would not go so far as to say that they are all substantially equivalent, but there is a broad precedent in the way in which they have been laid out. There was an agreement with Ukraine in 1998; with Kazakhstan in 1999; and with Armenia in the same year. A treaty with Belarus was decided against by the EU, and in the case of Turkmenistan the agreement, which was signed in 1998, still remains to be ratified.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000023"></a>My honourable friend in the other place, Mark Francois, raised a number of issues which I believe were adequately addressed. However, one of the most important issues that he raised, which was not entirely addressed, was that of the dissuasion and prevention of terrorist activity in Tajikistan. Its strategic importance, bordering, as it does, Afghanistan, cannot be overstated. It is of vital importance, so I was surprised to read the Minister&#146;s words in another place when he admitted that Tajik nationals were involved in radical Islamist groups actively involved in terrorism in the region as a whole and claimed that it did not affect this country. I remind Her Majesty's Government that we have troops in Afghanistan who have to deal with the presence of regional terrorism day to day. Can the noble Baroness give further information on what is being done to tackle fundamentalist radical Islamism in Tajikistan beyond  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the investment in a border police? The Minister in another place did not give a comprehensive answer on what is being done to encourage co-operation between our two countries to assist British, European and anti-terrorist groups currently engaged in Afghanistan, so I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to elaborate further on that today.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000024"></a>Generally, we support these measures and believe that it is vital to help the republics of the former Soviet Union to emerge from the scourge of communism and to form links with Europe based on trade and co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="07102326000025"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07102326000102"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> When the European Union&#151;or European Communities, as it was then known&#151;was developing in earlier days, the frequent cry, rightly, from both supporters and critics was always that the communities should avoid being inward looking, introspective and concerned only with their own internal matters but should look outwards and be a genuine international body as well. We therefore welcome this order, as an example of those developing relationships between the European Union and all the neighbouring or nearby geographical areas surrounding the borders of the enlarged Union of 27 countries.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000026"></a>This order would be a standard text in many ways, which is one of the reasons&#151;apart from the absence of any technical mistakes or drafting errors&#151;why, in July, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments said that there was no need formally to report. I welcomed that&#151;I was a member of that committee and still am. The text and import of this agreement would be routine and standard, as it is with many other areas, but for the enormous number of problems that the new emerging republic of Tajikistan is experiencing and will experience in future.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000027"></a>I am sure that all right-thinking citizens in the republic of Tajikistan welcome the involvement of the European Union in trying to help them with these matters. It is that delicate balance, again, between the Union offering genuine advice from outside at the request of a Government and as a result of signing this treaty and passing this order in all the national Parliaments, and not seeking to interfere and dictate how they should run their own country. That is particularly important for new countries when they are learning governance, having been a Soviet republic, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, said, for a long time&#151;since the Second World War and, indeed, for some time before.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000028"></a>For those of us who do not know the particular &#147;stans&#148; in the area&#151;and I confess that I am one&#151;it is equally complicated to make the differences clear to an audience in Great Britain and other western European countries. But these countries, of which, as the Minister said, Tajikistan is the poorest, are very important, which is why the order will be vital. We welcome its passing today, following the debate on  16 October in the other place, when there was positive support for the order and a hope that it would take effect soon.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000029"></a>There is a long list of problems, which I would be tempted to go into but they have already been enunciated by the Minister and the noble Lord. I, too,  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>request that those questions might be answered a little more. There is extreme anxiety about the heroin trade and the country&#146;s proximity to Afghanistan means that the citizens of Tajikistan suffer grievously from the effects of that as well as from terrorism and the other things that the Minister mentioned. The European Union and the United Kingdom, as one of the leading member states anxious to continue its long tradition as an international power with relations with all parts of the world, including the third world and the developing world, will wish to play a key part. Therefore, I hope that national ambassadors in the capital city, as well as the EU representative, will get very much involved with these matters in future.</p>
<h5><a name="07102326000094"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000030"></a>If the Minister can add a few words to deal with some of those problems, I do not wish to go on longer, except to quote the remarks of my colleague, the honourable Member for Cheadle, in the debate in the Second Delegated Legislation Committee of the other place on 16 October:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07102326000088"></a>&#147;It is in the interests of the European Community as a whole to ensure that democracy in Tajikistan is stable and well developed&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102326000084"></a>we are far from reaching that point now&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07102326000090"></a>&#147;and that human rights are respected&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102326000085"></a>That is also a severe problem in this new republic. He went on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="07102326000091"></a>&#147;To achieve that, a timeline with set goals for improving human rights and democracy needs to be agreed as part of the EU co-operation process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102326000086"></a>He then asked the Minister to address that issue.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000031"></a>Mr Murphy tried to do so, but we need more details. There are still some gaps in the information and the responses by the Government. I make no criticism; it is inevitably so at this early stage of the passing of this order and the co-operation agreement. </p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000032"></a>My colleague, Mr Hunter, went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07102326000089"></a>&#147;We are encouraged by the inclusion in the agreement of co-operation on the prevention of illegal activities. There have been considerable problems with drug trafficking in the region, particularly with smugglers crossing over from Afghanistan. I hope that through the agreement, the EC can co-operate with and encourage the Government of Tajikistan to continue their work to stop the drugs trafficking operations, which of course serve only to further destabilise the region&#148;&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Second Delegated Legislation Committee, 16/10/07; col. 7.].</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07102326000087"></a>He concluded by asking the Minister to address  those concerns in his response. We need more encouragement and shows of support from this country and the Union, and more reassurance to the Tajiks that we take these matters seriously, that they are not a marginal consideration to us and that we are going to be truly helpful to what will be not only a more prosperous country in future, but a very important one in that region.</p>

<p><a name="07102326000033"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07102326000103"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for the broad support from noble Lords opposite. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, is correct that there is a broad precedent in relation to agreements  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with Soviet republics. This agreement is particularly important because of the country&#146;s strategic position and its extreme poverty.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000034"></a>The prevention of terrorism is of the utmost importance. Tajikistan hosts a French military base that supports coalition forces in Afghanistan, which I am sure is of interest. The central Asia strategy, of which I spoke earlier, sets out the EU&#146;s intention to step up co-operation with the central Asian states to combat international terrorism by improving the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies, updating the legal framework, improving border management and strengthening regional co-operation against trans-national organised crime, including international terrorism. The counter-terrorism activity is within the broader context of the central Asia strategy.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, is right that the EU is now looking outward, and this is a fine example of the way in which we are developing relationships with surrounding countries. Learning good governance is a key part of the agreement under discussion today. One of its aims is to promote democratic reforms. The UK is already working on democratic reform. Our embassy is supporting projects that develop the capacity and quality of civil society and independent media, promote good governance, particularly at local government level, and address the threat of conflicts through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we are spending &#163;98,000 on a project with the Aga Khan Foundation developing a system to mitigate conflicts over the use of water in the Khatlon region of Tajikistan. There are many other examples of the way in which we are promoting democratic reform.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000036"></a>The noble Lord raised the vital issue of counter-narcotics. We have made a &#163;500,000 contribution to build the capacity of the 8th Afghan border police as part of a larger EC project of &#8364;3 million to replicate the border management central Asia programme on the Afghan side of the Tajik border. UK funds will establish mobile training teams while Germany develops regional border liaison networks. Unfortunately, this element has recently been suspended due to Tajik reluctance, for legal reasons, to set up networks. However, we are working hard on counter-narcotics and take these issues seriously. The Tajiks know that we take them seriously, and we expect our new relationship with Tajikistan to be an honest one. We will ensure that these issues are taken as seriously as they deserve.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000037"></a>The birth of independent Tajikistan was difficult. A civil war in the 1990s killed more than 60,000 of its people and displaced many more. It was always the poorest of the Soviet republics but the war badly damaged its infrastructure, drove many of its best professionals away and its school and health services are still well below those of Soviet times. About  57 per cent of Tajikistan&#146;s population live in poverty, many of them shackled to cotton production in former collective farms. That 57 per cent lives on less than a dollar a day.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000038"></a>This discussion has confirmed the crucial role that the EU must play in winning hearts and minds in Tajikistan, both in competition with others and to

<p><a name="07102326000042"></a>The regulations are made under Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and form one component of the Government&#146;s strategy to make better use of the existing road network by improving road safety, reducing congestion and minimising the impact of road traffic on the environment. The Traffic Management Act gives local authorities a specific duty to manage their networks, and fair and effective parking enforcement has a key role to play in this. When a local authority takes over this responsibility from the police, it frees up police time to concentrate on more serious matters. It also means that parking regulations are, often for the first time, enforced throughout the area and at all appropriate times. Although this does not always please motorists, it is essential to facilitate the safe and smooth use of the highway.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000043"></a>There are over 28 million vehicles on the roads in England and each of them spends an average of 23 out of 24 hours parked. Managing that demand is what we ask local authorities to do. These regulations will help them to do it in a fair, transparent and effective manner with the overarching objective of keeping traffic moving safely.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000044"></a>The regulations before your Lordships set out the procedures for disputing a penalty charge notice, a vehicle immobilisation or a vehicle removal. Some drivers believe that a penalty charge notice or the clamping or removal of a vehicle is never merited, but it may genuinely be the case that the charge was served or the vehicle restrained or removed in error. That might be because the driver was delivering or collecting goods and had left the vehicle to do so; or a valid permit, ticket, voucher or badge may have been displayed on the vehicle at the time; or the owner who received the payment reminder was not the owner at the time of the contravention. A penalty charge  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>notice, or parking ticket, is not a serious matter and does not involve endorsements on the driving licence, but it does have a financial impact that a fair society should levy only when merited.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000045"></a>Clamping and removal are a considerable inconvenience, even when merited. When they are not merited, far stronger language springs to mind. The measures put in place to challenge penalty charge notices, vehicle immobilisation and vehicle removal are an important part of delivering a just enforcement system.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000046"></a>The procedures for representations and appeals set out in these regulations largely replicate those in the Road Traffic Act 1991. That Act replaced a costly and time-consuming procedure in the magistrates&#146; court with a simple and streamlined independent adjudicator who dealt only with parking matters. That original vision has been changed to some extent by adding bus lane, certain moving traffic and congestion charging contraventions to the responsibilities of the adjudicators. However, we need to ensure that the procedures remain simple and easily accessible to the public, avoiding the fear that they will need costly legal or other representation to make their case properly.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000047"></a>We believe that the draft regulations before the Committee deliver the continuation of simple and straightforward procedures for representations to the issuing authority and appeals to the adjudicator that are easily accessible to the public. They have been subject to extensive consultation but few comments were received on the representations and appeals provisions, and the changes that have been made since the consultation largely result from reconsideration by government.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000048"></a>We have also had the benefit of expert and robust advice on our proposals from the entirely independent adjudicators. This reflects their expertise in dealing with many thousands of individual cases and we are grateful to them for their advice.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000049"></a>I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the areas where the draft regulations now improve on the current procedures. As recommended by the House of Commons Transport Committee, the penalty charge notice will itself state the procedures for representations and appeals. The committee was of the view that there is widespread ignorance of the challenge procedures and that putting them on the penalty charge notice would help to resolve this.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000050"></a>The circumstances in which a representation and an appeal can be made have been widened specifically to include instances where the enforcement authority has not followed the correct procedures. This ground would cover things such as an authority&#146;s failure to observe the correct time limits or include the right information in notices, or a case where a local authority had served a penalty charge notice by post when it was not authorised to do so.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000051"></a>Finally, the adjudicator will have the power to return to the local authority for reconsideration of a case where a contravention has taken place but in mitigating circumstances. That could cover cases where a driver had to pull over because someone in the car had become ill or the cheque for a resident&#146;s parking permit had been banked by the local authority but the  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>permit had been lost in the post. Local authorities have long had the power to cancel a penalty charge notice in such circumstances but a few have shown some reluctance to use this power. The adjudicators will now be able to ask them to consider the case again.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000052"></a>The regulations will be widely welcomed by local authorities and the public. It has taken a lot of hard work to balance the needs of local authorities for a strong and effective enforcement regime and the needs of motorists for one that is flexible and fair. The regulations are based on the successful regime put in place by the Road Traffic Act 1991 but make a few key changes to help to deliver a fairer and more transparent system of effective parking enforcement by local authorities. I beg to move.</p>

We support what we hope will be an improvement in road safety and congestion problems, as well as a reduction in carbon emissions that would follow as a result. Therefore, we support the theme and ideas behind the regulations.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000055"></a>As many know, I am the leader of a local authority and therefore welcome the local authority part of the regulations and the strength that they give local authorities. However, I have one or two points to raise about natural justice and how the public can appeal. At the end of her statement, the Minister went to some lengths to present the result of the various negotiations and discussions on the regulations in the House of Commons Select Committee and elsewhere, but my understanding is that there is still some unease about how the public might get treated by local authorities.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000056"></a>As we have just been told, there is an appeal process, which will be mentioned on the ticket displayed on the car. If motorists are unhappy, they can make an appeal to the public adjudicator, who will consider it; they can then ask the local authority to reconsider, but the local authority is not bound to do that. There could be a problem with natural justice there. The local authority should be bound to reconsider the matter if the adjudicator goes back to it and says that there is a problem. At the moment, as I understand it, the local authority could just ignore that. I do not think that that is right in terms of natural justice. If the adjudicator feels that there is a real problem, the local authority should be bound to reconsider. I hope that the Minister will consider that further because I have received representations that there is a little flaw in the regulations. Apart from that point, I support the whole recommendation.</p>

Some local authorities are taking them seriously but I am not sure that all are doing so. However, anything that keeps matters out of the courts, simplifies procedures and, in particular, takes them out of the hands of the police I warmly welcome.</p>

<p><a name="07102326000058"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07102326000107"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank noble Lords for their support, with one or two reservations, for the regulations. It is generally a good news story&#151;and the covenant between government, local authorities and the public always needs to be monitored continually so that the public feel that they are being fairly treated on parking and other issues relevant to these regulations.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that there was still some disquiet that the public could not appeal, in that local authorities were not bound to take the decisions of the adjudicator into account in the last resort. Perhaps I may go over with him the mitigating circumstances that are now part of the regulations but were not there before. Although it may not answer his point completely&#151;I do not think that I can do that&#151;it may give him a little more confidence.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000060"></a>An adjudicator will have the power to refer a case back to the enforcement authority for reconsideration where a contravention has taken place but in mitigating circumstances. The department&#146;s statutory guidance makes it clear that such a case should be referenced to the local authority&#146;s chief executive so that, when it is referred back, it goes not simply to one department but gets a wider view by the local authority. The thinking behind that is that other voices may then come in on the side of the person whose case has been referred back because of that wider view.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000061"></a>This provision was introduced into Section 80 of the Traffic Management Act at the specific request of Parliament, which was at one with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, over this concern. The Government believe that their response is as far as we can go on this at the moment. There will, of course, be a review to ensure that it is working properly.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000062"></a>As I said, the provision was introduced at the specific request of Parliament. Government policy is that the function of the adjudicator is to determine whether any of the statutory grounds of appeal apply and to allow appeals only where he or she makes a finding to that effect. Local authorities have wide discretion to cancel a PCN&#151;they always have had. Giving this power to the adjudicator would strongly discourage local authorities from deciding cases involving mitigating circumstances. It would also substantially increase the number of penalty charge notices that motorists take to appeal.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000063"></a>Judges who have looked at cases involving mitigation have taken the view that decisions on cases such as these should be based on policies but that those policies should not be used rigidly or formulaically. Adjudicators are not in a position to make policies, let alone follow them consistently. Making policy is the responsibility of elected councillors, and that is why it should ultimately come back to the council&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="07102326000064"></a>A High Court challenge to an adjudication can be made only on a point of law. Very few cases have been to the High Court since this system was introduced. If adjudicators can use discretion, there will a substantial increase in the number of cases going to the High Court because their decision will be seen as random rather than based on a balance of probabilities as to whether a contravention took place. That is not what parking enforcement should be about. On that basis, I hope that I have answered noble Lords&#146; questions.</p>

<h5><a name="07102326000097"></a>4.08 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07102326000066"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07102326000108"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000067"></a>The noble Baroness said: These regulations introduce a new way for highway authorities in England to manage works on the public highway. We all recognise the importance of our roads for businesses and communities, and for moving people and goods around towns and cities and across the country. We are also all familiar with works that create hold-ups on those roads, whether carried out by utility companies or by highway authorities which themselves are responsible for, and have a duty to, manage the road network. Permit schemes will provide highway authorities with a more effective tool to help them manage these works and thus reduce the delay and congestion that they cause. Permit schemes were introduced under Part 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004, which included a provision, in Section 39(4), that the first regulations about permit schemes,</p>
<ul><a name="07102326000092"></a>&#147;may not be made ... unless a draft of them has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000068"></a>These regulations provide a detailed framework for applications for permit schemes and for the content and operation of those schemes. Highway authorities may prepare and administer individual permit schemes within that framework only. Permit schemes prepared by local highway authorities will take effect only when they are approved by the Secretary of State following extensive local consultation.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000069"></a>Under a permit scheme, any utility or highway authority wanting to carry out works in a street specified in that scheme would need to obtain a permit before the relevant works are begun. A local authority may choose to attach conditions to a permit, such as specifying the days or times when work may be done. Local authorities will be able to make exceptions to permit requirements in certain circumstances, which will enable emergency works to be dealt with promptly. Utilities will pay a fee for a permit which will cover the cost of administration in relation to their works.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000070"></a>The draft regulations have been drawn up following extensive consultation, particularly with the permits working group, which consists of representatives from local authorities and utility companies. It has resulted in a number of changes in the draft regulations now before the Committee.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000071"></a>The policy objective behind permit schemes is to give highway authorities greater control over work in the street that may cause disruption. While those works may be necessary, how they are planned, co-ordinated and carried out can make a great difference to their impact. The intention is that the highway authority should be proactive in managing and co-ordinating its own and other promoters&#146; works, enabling authorities to have better managed local road networks and reduced local congestion.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000072"></a>We believe that permits will be a valuable new tool to achieve those ends. For example, permit schemes can be arranged so that where gas or water companies want to maintain pipes in the same street they will have an incentive to work together and perhaps co-ordinate their work with the highway authority street maintenance programme. Even if it is not physically possible for works promoters to combine their activities, local authorities will be better able to manage and co-ordinate all works to minimise the overall impact and reduce disruption and congestion. </p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000073"></a>It will not be mandatory for highway authorities to run permit schemes, nor do we expect that all highway authorities will wish to do so. The regulations provide a framework for permit schemes. We have also issued statutory guidance and a code of practice. While the regulations will require a degree of standardisation in permit schemes&#151;for example, all schemes must include utility and highways works and they must be treated equally&#151;there will also be some flexibility. Authorities will be able to choose whether to operate a permit scheme over all or some of their roads in all or some of their area.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000074"></a>When it comes to considering applications from authorities to operate a permit scheme, a key factor will be the expected balance of costs and benefits. The Government are aware of the concerns of utility companies about fee levels. The regulations constrain the level of fees so that only the costs associated with running a permit scheme attributable to utility works can be recovered by fees and an absolute upper limit is imposed on fees. We are equally aware that some local authorities have concerns about fee levels from the opposite perspective: that the cap on fees will not enable them to cover the relevant share of the costs. The Government consider that the maximum fee levels proposed should enable authorities to go ahead with setting up permit schemes. We will be reviewing the first permit schemes after a year to look at their operation and see whether they are achieving their objectives. The appropriateness of fee levels will be part of that review.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000075"></a>As we see it, the benefits of successful permit schemes will be substantial, with reduced disruption and delay. Reduced occupation of the road by activities helps to reduce congestion and maximises the efficiency of the existing highway network, improving reliability and making journeys more  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>predictable, as well as faster. This makes journeys easier to plan and reduces the amount of wasted or unproductive time. With reduced congestion comes reduced local pollution, with benefits for air quality and other aspects of the environment. Public transport can also operate more reliably and provide a better service to the public, potentially further relieving congestion on the road by attracting motorists on to public transport.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000076"></a>In conclusion, the regulations will, I am sure, be widely welcomed. It has taken a great deal of hard work to achieve the right balance between the needs of road users and the need for effective and well-maintained infrastructure. I am grateful to everyone who has contributed so far to trying to find that balance, and I commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

This sort of scheme could reduce congestion considerably, and anything that reduces congestion reduces carbon emissions and improves quality of life. The AA has estimated that on any one day 4 million holes are dug in this country. If that number can be reduced so that things work better, then we will have achieved something. I think we all want to work towards that.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000079"></a>I totally support the general thrust of the regulations. I almost wish that it was mandatory for local authorities to take part in the scheme and I hope that most of them will. There would be a slight problem if one local authority took it up but a neighbouring one did not when a new sewage or water system was being put through the two authorities. It has been suggested that that could be dealt with through the new multi-area agreements between local authorities, which will come into force under different legislation. It will obviously make sense for two or three local authorities to work together when they are all involved in a major scheme.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000080"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister. The legislation currently allows up to three months for permit applications to be processed. I come from a local authority background and want to ensure that enough time is allowed in that regard. Could a three-month delay sometimes hold up major infrastructural maintenance and the introduction of new services, particularly to a new estate, for example, which needs new services? Is three months too long for a utility company to wait for a permit? I hope that local authorities can turn round applications quickly, but sometimes we are not allowed three months for a planning application and it might be too long to wait for a permit to be processed.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000081"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned that she would look at how the scheme was working after a year. I like to think that the Government will find out whether it is reducing delays, congestion and carbon emissions and  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether the utility companies are co-operating with it. I hope that the Government will carry out a comprehensive review after a year, as the Minister mentioned.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000082"></a>Has any thought been given to how many local authorities will take up the scheme? As I said earlier, I hope that they all do. I shall certainly encourage them to do so and I hope that the Local Government Association will too.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07102326000083"></a>Finally, the fine for non-compliance is only &#163;500. Will a major company doing infrastructure work be deterred from getting on with a big project with a fine of &#163;500? I know that one can resort to the courts and so on, but could there not be more latitude on the level of the fine for non-compliance? It will have very little effect on a &#163;1 billion business. Perhaps the noble Baroness could answer those points. Having said that, we support the thrust of the regulations. We hope that the scheme will work and I shall do my bit to encourage it from a local authority point of view.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000003"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07102338000064"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I, too, welcome the order; it has been a long time coming. There has been a lot of representation from the utilities about this, a lot of which has been somewhat febrile. The utilities basically make a lot of money: they post huge profits and get sold to one another for large profits. Against that, we are talking about permits&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has just said&#151;where the fines are almost derisory. In preparation for today, I have a note from the police on this issue. Some of the penalties currently levied, such as &#163;30 for no seatbelts or driving a heavy lorry through country lanes, are ludicrously low. In fact, the operator, in the case of a heavy lorry, recoups that on one illegal journey, of which he makes many. Similarly, along with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I believe that the penalty level for not observing the permit regulations is too low and hope that it will be taken into account in the review.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000004"></a>The Minister mentioned that the schemes would have to be authorised by the Secretary of State. Why? If the permit scheme is designed in accordance with the regulations and put before a local authority&#151;a county council in many cases, or a metropolitan authority&#151;surely its officers should be able to decide whether the scheme has been advanced in accordance with the regulations before it. I deplore the Government&#146;s attitude that everything has to go to the highest level. I know that the Secretary of State does not sign it, but an official on his behalf&#151;but is that official any better qualified, for example, than the chief executive or director of a local authority? Will the Minister ruminate on this making a cumbersome process? I hope&#151;again, with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield&#151;that a lot of people take up this system.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000005"></a>I hear what the noble Lord says about a permit scheme possibly being needed within three months. However, from my knowledge of utility schemes, they are several years in the planning, as is a new estate. Utility companies would be well advised to get in their applications in a timely fashion and not resort to the use of emergency powers. They often do that, and

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000006"></a>I do not take the views of the utility companies into consideration any more. The Government have listened long and hard to them, and have possibly erred too far on their side. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I represent people who have to use the roads, whose journeys are constantly disrupted. They want to see proper planning of the highway brought in so that it can be managed in the most effective way. </p>

<p><a name="07102338000007"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07102338000065"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> I ought to say a few words on this, since I took part in the discussions on the Traffic Management Act when we put it together. First, including the highways authorities in these proposals is very welcome. One problem we pointed out was that much of the intention would be wasted if we did not include the highways authorities, since they are responsible for a lot of the works. After that, however, I am afraid that I immediately start to wonder whether we are just inventing a whole lot of bureaucratic bloat. We discussed the voluntary, collaborative approach that worked very well in Scotland, which was then called Susiephone&#151;I know it has changed its name, and I have no idea what it is called now. Incentives tend to work much better than sticks&#151;regulations. Regulations tend to include delaying processes and stop things happening, whereas with incentives people do things and things happen. They provide a different way of thinking.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000008"></a>On bureaucracy, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, spoke of authorities working together. Back in 2005 when implementing electronic government stuff, trying to get one county and 12 districts to work together on e-procurement was impossible. We finally managed to get half of them to work together and the other half would not take part at all. The issue of common or joint permits going across county boundaries can be quite important if the counties do not collaborate properly. I see more problems, challenges, different timetabling, different forms to be filled in in different ways, and so on. If we have this system, the Minister will have to ensure that the forms are not totally incompatible across boundaries, which can easily happen.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000009"></a>I then started to think about the possible downside to this. There is a three-month delay. If one is trying to get a broadband connection into a new place, it is bad enough at the moment to get people to turn up to do it, but on top of that, one has another three-month&#146; delay while the local authority thinks about how it will schedule it. What will be the benefit? The critical benefit is that it will try to attack the 10 per cent of congestion caused by road works&#151;we are not talking about the primary cause of congestion. We will try to co-ordinate road works better, so that the road is dug up only once instead of three times. That is why a long delay is needed to try to co-ordinate road works.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000010"></a>One is also delaying such matters as the green agenda and helping people to work from home. If people cannot get the communications, they cannot work from home. As a result, carbon production will

Such things will not aggregate properly. For some reason, the timescales will be wrong. I cannot believe that if it were that simple it would not have been done years ago, collaboratively. I think one will find that the challenges are too great and all that one is doing is introducing yet another bureaucratic layer and no improvements will be seen at the end.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000011"></a>What improvements do we think there will be? The hope is for a 3 per cent reduction in congestion, which is one-third of the 10 per cent that is caused by street works. That is quite a high proportion. A lot of co-ordination of activity will be required to make it go smoothly and I do not think that will happen at all. I think we will just be investing in another department. In reality, it is a hidden tax because the permits are expected to rake in &#163;36.3 million for local authorities, which will be very nice for them, particularly as they are no longer being funded so well from central government. They will see that huge advantage.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000012"></a>There will be some soft benefits, but the ROI is not very good. If I were a businessman, I would not spend &#163;36.3 million to get a &#163;38.7 million possible benefit. The difference is that that &#163;38.7 million is not a concrete benefit; it is someone saying, &#147;If we take the amount of petrol burnt by the cars sitting in traffic jams&#148;, and so on. It is yet another hidden tax. This time it will not purely be on the motorist, but actually on everyone trying to get a better water system, better drainage, broadband connections and everything else. It concerns me and I am sorry that I cannot join in the general feeling of how wonderful this is. I am glad that this will be reviewed after a year and I hope someone does a proper cost-benefit analysis at that point.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000013"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07102338000066"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank noble Lords for taking part in this interesting and intriguing discussion. I shall respond to as many of the issues raised as possible. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked how roads would be affected when one authority operates a permit scheme but its neighbour does not. The permit scheme will specify clearly which streets and roads are within the scheme, which will be available for all to see. The notices regime will be on roads without permit schemes.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000014"></a>Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Traffic Management Act to facilitate the expeditious movement of all traffic on other authorities&#146; networks, as the noble Lord will know. Authorities must work with their neighbours where their actions will affect other authorities. That would apply to the authority running a permit scheme and to the adjacent authority running a notices scheme. There are similarities between the permit scheme and the notices scheme that mean that the difference between them should not be too great as far as the IT systems are concerned, so good communications between the authorities will still be possible and the IT systems will have mechanisms to facilitate that.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and other noble Lords asked about the review. We recognise that the use of permits is a new way of working and it must  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be shown that benefits are realised. This takes up the final point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, about a cost-benefit exercise. The first permit schemes are to be reviewed after a year of operation, so we are probably talking about the spring or summer of 2009. The review will elevate the performance of permit schemes against the current baseline. It will also compare performances against highway authorities not operating permit schemes. We will also look at information on how schemes operating over different categories of roads compare in delivering benefits&#151;for example, highway authorities operating schemes on traffic-sensitive roads only compared with those operating schemes over all roads. In particular, the review will look closely at the appropriateness of the permit fees. We intend to publish the review and will ensure that it is provided to Parliament at the appropriate time.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked how many local authorities we envisage running permit schemes. Our current feedback is that at present six to eight local authorities are interested, but we envisage 150 authorities finally running schemes. We will assess each application, and each local highway authority has to justify fully its costs and benefits. Transport for London has expressed an interest and it is thought that that scheme is likely to be replicated in some London boroughs. Some of them may be ready to start with Transport for London, but others are likely to join later. Kent County Council has also expressed an interest in applying to run a permit scheme.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000017"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked about the three months&#146; notice, which they thought might be a barrier. It is required for major works only. Most connections will be much quicker and will need far shorter notice. Local authorities can be flexible about allowing an early start, if that is practical. We do not envisage it for the majority of works.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000018"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Bradshaw and Lord Hanningfield, raised the issue of the level of fines. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was quite passionate about this. The offences that attract FPNs in permit schemes are serious. Working without a permit or in breach of the conditions will attract a fine because they undermine the permit scheme and could have a significant detrimental effect on the management and co-ordination of the network. The levels of fines were consulted on widely, and we have changed our original proposals. It was initially proposed that working without a permit and working in breach of a condition of the permit should be level 5 offences. We have now created two different levels of offences, reflecting the severity of the offence. The first offence is at level 5, up to a maximum of &#163;5,000, for working without a permit, and the second is less serious for breaching a permit condition, which is a level 4 offence up to a maximum of &#163;2,500. It is worth bearing in mind that both offences may be avoided by prompt payment of a fixed penalty fee, where given.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked why the Secretary of State would be needed to approve the running of these schemes. These are significant new powers for authorities and there are significant costs to utilities in the permit fees. The Government want  


<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be sure that the appropriate balance is struck for all parties and it is important that schemes run efficiently and with parity for both authorities and utility companies and demonstrate that they deliver the stated benefits. Again, the Government want to be sure that the schemes will achieve their objectives and do so fairly. As many utilities work across several local authority areas, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has said, there must be some consistency between schemes to enable utilities to operate effectively and efficiently. Permit schemes are not a revenue stream for authorities and authorities must show that fee income does not exceed the share of costs of operating the permit scheme attributable to utilities over and above their duty under the New Roads and Streets Works Act 1991.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred to the slow delivery of the regulations. In an ideal world we would have liked a to have them earlier but these are complex matters and it is important to get it right. It is important to allow time for the utilities, authorities and others to have their say and to help to shape the regulations so that they work as intended. The key now is that we have them ready so that there is a chance to make a step change in the management of works in the streets.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000021"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the fixed penalty notice as being too low to be a deterrent. As I say, fixed penalty notices were adjusted after consultation and the notice for working in the street without a permit was raised from &#163;250 to &#163;500. I know that the noble Lord thinks that that is still not enough, but we believe that &#163;500 is not an insignificant figure, especially in relation to minor works. Authorities also have the option of taking the utilities to court, where fines can be up to &#163;5,000.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000022"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said that permit schemes were too bureaucratic for the benefits that we claim for them. Through the working group involvement of key stakeholders, we have aimed to provide a scheme that is not unnecessarily complicated. The key aim is that at any time it should be possible for all parties to know whether there is a permit and what conditions are attached. All processes are geared to that one end. It may seem more complicated than it is because we necessarily have to provide for all eventualities. In reality we would expect many, if not most cases, to be straightforward&#151;application made, permit issued and work carried out in accordance with the permit. But we are on a learning curve and we expect all parties to learn the ropes quickly.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000023"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07102338000067"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> In the cost benefit review, could the Minister include the cost of the bureaucracy on both sides, because there will be an added cost to the utilities? That would be useful in trying to make up our minds whether the schemes are worthwhile.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000024"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07102338000068"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I have just taken advice and am sure that that will be included. When we were talking about the number of highway authorities taking up the scheme, we began with the fact that there are 150 highway authorities. We hope that the majority will take up the scheme and I think I said that six to eight were in the process of doing that.</p>

<h5><a name="07102338000061"></a>4.40 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07102338000026"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07102338000069"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Defence Service (Very High Cost Cases) Regulations 2007.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000027"></a>The noble Lord said: These regulations are made by the Lord Chancellor under Section 15(5) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 and are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure under Section 25(9) of that Act. This instrument is being made to bring into effect part of the changes to the Very High Cost Case (Crime) Panel recommended by my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles in his independent review of legal aid procurement.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000028"></a>Individuals who receive publicly funded legal representation in criminal cases can generally choose their representative. In very high cost cases, the choice of representative will be limited to members of a panel set up by the Legal Services Commission. This instrument provides that, where an individual has chosen a representative who is not a member of the panel and the case is classified as a very high cost case, the commission need not continue to fund representation. The commission will continue to have discretion to go on funding a representative who is not a member of the panel. This is because in certain circumstances&#151;for example, when a case falls within scope only at a late stage&#151;there would be no benefit in taking it under the very high cost contract after the bulk of the work had been completed. The instrument also provides that the individual may choose a new representative from the panel.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000029"></a>Very high cost cases have been managed under individual case contracts by the Legal Services Commission since 2001, and the contracting arrangements remain largely unchanged after the panel is formed. These arrangements were introduced in response to growing concerns about the rapidly growing expenditure being incurred in the longest and most complex cases in the Crown Court. It was widely recognised that the method of paying lawyers by determining appropriate fees after the event&#151;ex post facto<I></I>determination&#151;did not exercise control over the increasing cost of these cases. Very high cost cases account for around  &#163;100 million of legal aid expenditure each year. The management of those cases by the commission will not be changed by these regulations, and those who successfully become panel members will work with the commission in the same way that they do now.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000030"></a>Since 2001, a defendant&#146;s choice of representation in fraud trials has been restricted to litigators who are members of the Serious Fraud Panel. In future, the choice in all VHCC cases will be restricted to those who are panel members. All panel members will have to meet quality criteria and have previous experience of managing such cases. It is in the best interest of all concerned, including defendants, the wider criminal justice system and taxpayers, if the most experienced representatives conduct these cases.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000031"></a>The Government&#146;s strategy for legal aid was set out in <I>A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid</I> in July 2005, which set out the need to rebalance spending between civil and criminal legal aid. One of the recommendations was an independent review of legal aid procurement. As I mentioned earlier, my noble friend Lord Carter carried out that review. His report, <I>Legal Aid</I><I>: A market-</I><I>based approach to reform</I>, and the accompanying DCA/Legal Services Commission consultation paper, <I>Legal Aid: a sustainable future</I>, were published in July 2006<I>.</I> The Government set out their proposals for legal aid reform in <I>Legal Aid Reform: the Way Ahead </I>in November 2006.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000032"></a>My noble friend Lord Carter proposed a number of amendments to the system of individual case contracts for very high cost cases, currently defined as cases expected to last 41 days or more at trial. He also proposed that a small proportion of trials expected to last 25 days or more be included within the VHCC scheme. My noble friend believed that better value for money could be obtained for this work by giving defence teams some probability of increased or more consistent volume in return for a modest reduction in hourly rates. To achieve this, we will establish a panel and limit access to it to defence teams who can show a track record of experience in working on very high cost cases and meet appropriate quality standards.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000033"></a>In addition to the wider public consultation undertaken in response to the report by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, the Legal Services Commission published a further consultation document, <I>Best Value Panel for Very High Cost Cases.</I> A response to that consultation, <I>Best Value Panel for Very High Cost Cases.</I><I></I><I>Final Response to Consultation</I>, was published<I></I>in April 2007, together with a final regulatory impact assessment.</p>

There will be further questions about the report by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, in due course, just as there have been debates in the past, and I do not want to get into wider Carter issues at this point. However, we are grateful that the Government are trying to ensure that anyone who is going to deal with cases of this sort will be properly qualified to do so.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000037"></a>Having said all that, there is only one major question that I want to put to the Government, and I am sure that the noble Lord will be able to give us a clear answer. He referred to costs, and I shall refer to the

Paragraph 4.2 of the regulatory impact assessment is entitled &#147;VCHH expenditure and volumes&#148;. The noble Lord mentioned that about &#163;100 million was spent on such cases. Paragraph 4.2.3 shows that litigators cost &#163;55 million, advocates &#163;44 million and disbursements&#151;whatever they are&#151;&#163;4 million. Paragraph 4.2.5 details which firms received what. Paragraph 4.3 is entitled &#147;Rationale for Government Intervention&#148;. Paragraph 4.3.1 ends by very sensibly referring to,</p>
<ul><a name="07102338000059"></a>&#147;concerns about whether the taxpayer is getting best value for money on VHCCs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07102338000057"></a>I would like the noble Lord to give me some sort of prediction about the figures in paragraph 4.2.2 for the year ending 2009&#151;not 2007 or 2008 because they are too early as this will only come in in 2009. I am sure he will have those figures in front of him or, if not, that those behind him can offer him advice. If he does not have them, I do not see much point in paragraph 4.3 referring to &#147;rationale for government intervention&#148;. I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s response.</p>

I understand from my clerk that my name has been put forward for five or six defence teams which are bidding for contracts under this new system and it looks as though I will be on the panel at some stage, perhaps by January when decisions will be made.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000039"></a>There has been a huge increase in the length of trials over my professional experience. In the old Stafford Crown Court there was a plaque above the jury box that commemorated the longest trial that had then taken place, which lasted 18 days. These days the prosecutor has barely cleared his throat at the end of 18 days.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000040"></a>Some years ago, when the very high cost cases were first introduced, I was involved in one or two&#151;I am a little out of touch because I have been doing lengthy courts martial, which come under a different system&#151;but they were hopelessly bureaucratic and useless. Contract managers had absolutely no experience of what went on in court, yet they were designated as approvers of whatever proposals were put to them by counsel and litigators, as they appear to be called these days, about the length of time a case would take. They had no way of judging that. I hope that by now they have a great deal of experience under their belts and are better at it. There were problems. After spending days preparing a case, any deviation required their approval and, if necessary, the adjournment of the court.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000041"></a>In a big case, courts cost anything between &#163;10,000 and &#163;15,000 a day. We had a ludicrous situation whereby a judge would be asked to adjourn so that counsel could pick up the phone to such an individual to ask whether he would be paid for reading the papers that the prosecution had served on him that morning. The last case I did was a court martial and I do not think a day went by without fresh papers being served on us. It is an ongoing problem. That need for everything to be approved is absolutely counterproductive. Nevertheless, the problem has to be tackled. The advent of the Rank

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000042"></a>We do not require such close control by someone who is not in court and who does not know what is going on, but we need rewards for doing things efficiently and quickly. It is possible to string out a case if one has nothing else to do and one wants to earn money that way, but that is contrary to the public interest. The parts of the Explanatory Memorandum and the attached regulatory impact assessment on which I have fastened are paragraphs 4.3.6 and 4.3.7. I agree that there is an opportunity to secure better value by creating a specialist panel by means of competition on price and capacity. I pause there to say that the danger is that one can create a cartel; so unless it is easy to join the panel&#151;or at least not too difficult to join it&#151;those on the panel will draw up the drawbridge and charge whatever they think is appropriate. If they are in competition only within a specialist panel themselves, the danger is that fees will rise.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000043"></a>The second matter, at paragraph 4.3.7, is that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07102338000058"></a>&#147;The Government also intends to require the LSC to start work with specialist practitioners to identify ways to incentivise and reward Defence Teams for representing their clients in more efficient ways. This will be more likely to be successful if the LSC is working with a specialist panel of firms for whom VHCC Work represents a long-term investment. At present, firms have insufficient incentive to invest in technology, training and high quality recruitment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000044"></a>I could not agree more that the Government should set about finding out what the appropriate incentives and rewards are for getting counsel and solicitors to do their jobs more efficiently and to be rewarded for being capable of getting to the point of a case, without drawing it out&#151;as happened in the Jubilee Line case, for example&#151;to the point where everyone loses heart and the case is dropped. I cannot come forward with any particular proposition at this time but it has always irritated me that some people spend days reading unnecessary papers and exhibits and get paid for it, whereas those of us who are a little more efficient and get to the point more quickly are paid the same, or sometimes less, than the inefficient practitioner. Obviously, if there is to be a panel, it is necessary to bring these regulations into effect but, if the case starts with one solicitor who is not a member of the panel, it has to be transferred. That is just a minor part of the overall picture and there can be no possible opposition to it.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000045"></a>I urge the Minister and those behind him to have in the forefront of their minds not bureaucratic control over how advocates and litigators do their job but incentives and rewards for those who act efficiently and get through cases by getting to the nub of them. In the old days&#151;unfortunately, I suppose that I am entitled to talk about the old days&#151;the assessment of fees was left very much to the court clerk or the clerk of quarter sessions or whoever. That person was in court and knew precisely the value of a particular advocate whereas, under this system, the person who decides what the rewards should be is sitting in an office at the end of a phone and has neither the

<p><a name="07102338000046"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07102338000072"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I thank the noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Thomas, for their helpful and constructive remarks. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that in future I intend to write to opposition spokespersons with details of forthcoming regulations. I am happy to give that commitment to the Committee.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000047"></a>I recognise that this is but one aspect of a fundamental reform of the legal aid system. As the noble Lord, Lord Henley, suggested, there will be opportunities in future to discuss progress in the reform programme. I also very much accept his point that these regulations are part of a restructuring of the way in which very high cost cases are funded, and they have the dual advantage of ensuring that there will be a quality check on people who provide services in future, alongside keeping control of the cost. On that basis, there is a real advantage to the public as well as the public purse.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000048"></a>The noble Lord was very confident that I would have the figures to hand. I am most grateful to him for that confidence; whether it is deserved or not, we will see. The spend for these cases in 2003-04 was &#163;26.3 million. By 2004-05, it had risen to &#163;66.6 million and by 2005-06 it had gone up to &#163;86.2 million. By 2006-07, it was &#163;99.9 million. As the noble Lord will observe, there has been a quite considerable increase. The noble Lord then asked me what I thought the savings would be in a full year. The estimate that officials have produced for me suggests between &#163;6.2 million and &#163;12.5 million. That obviously depends on a number of factors. These cases can last two to three years, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, suggested. As there is a catch-up in relation to the new structure, the savings will take some time to be realised fully. Clearly, however, we aim to make savings from an early stage.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made some interesting comments about the overall contracting regime. I had some sympathy with the general tenor of his remarks about the increase in the length of trials and whether an over-bureaucratic approach has been taken to contract management. There have been bureaucratic aspects to how contracts have been approved, which have been successful in controlling costs, but clearly we need to do better on how they are managed in future. This is not just a comment about very high cost cases, but is a general comment that has been made to me by representatives of legal organisations about the work of the Legal Services Commission. The Legal Services Commission is anxious to engage with the profession on how some of the bureaucratic controls can be reduced. I encourage that, within the constraints of public accountancy and the requirements of the National Audit Office and PAC. The LSC clearly has a delicate balance to draw there, but more needs to be done. There will be further discussions with the Bar Council and the Law Society.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000050"></a>The noble Lord is right to say that it is important that there is no cartel or closed shop. I assure him that the second and subsequent panels will not be restricted to suppliers who are successful in getting on the first panel. It clearly must be in the long-term interest of the Legal Services Commission to ensure that there are alternative providers for the second and subsequent panels.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000051"></a>The noble Lord quoted paragraphs 4.3.6 and 4.3.7 of the regulatory impact assessment, and endorsed the aim of ensuring that work in this area is rewarding and fairly paid for those who take part in it. We want them to feel that it is worth while investing in technology, training and high quality recruitment, as the RIA suggests. That is a general principle that I would subscribe to throughout the legal aid sector. Noble Lords will know that we are in a challenging time, and many firms are seriously considering how they will engage in the new structure&#151;solicitors as well as barristers. I want lawyers to feel that working in the legal aid sector is rewarding and is a field in which bright, young lawyers would wish to practise in the future. That is partly about how we developed the fee structure and partly about how best-value tendering comes into being in some aspects of the legal aid programme.</p>

<a name="71023-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07102338000052"></a>It is also about how we improve the general efficiency of the criminal justice system as a whole. Much of the change in the structure of legal aid fees is designed to encourage greater efficiency and effectiveness. However, defence teams are but one aspect of improving efficiency and effectiveness. My brief tenure in this department has led me to visit Coventry magistrates&#146; court to look at the CJSSS scheme, which is designed to improve the efficiency of the magistrates&#146; courts in Coventry and has had great success. All involved, including defence lawyers, the CPS, the police, the Bench and the court administration have recognised that by people working together the system can work more effectively for everyone. Clearly I am talking about magistrates&#146; courts, whereas the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, referred to a different area of the legal system.</p>

<p><a name="07102338000053"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07102338000073"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The Minister has left out very important stakeholders&#151;the defendants. What do they think of the system?</p>

<p><a name="07102338000054"></a><b><a name="71023-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07102338000074"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> That is a very fair point indeed. Some defendants may not deem more effective access to justice and quick dispensation of justice in their best interests. However, I can take a public interest view of this, that overall the system seems to work better. All that I meant to do before I foolishly went down that path was to agree with the noble Lord that simply dealing with how defence teams are paid will not in itself produce the developments that the RIA suggests. There have to be changes to the system as a whole, but defence teams can play their part and the fee structure will help that. </p>

<a name="71023-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07102330000011"></a>I am pleased to inform the House of the publication today of the first <I>Energy Markets Outlook</I>. This represents the first stage in delivering the Government's commitment in the 2007 energy White Paper to introduce a new information service. <I>Energy Markets Outlook</I> will provide forward-looking energy market information relating to security of supply.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07102330000012"></a>The energy White Paper set out the Government's continuing commitment to the combination of competitive markets and independent regulation as the most effective way of delivering affordable, sustainable and reliable energy supplies. Under this framework, energy companies are encouraged to invest in projects that will help maintain secure and reliable supplies. They do this in response to the price signals emerging from energy markets and the demands of their customers.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07102330000013"></a>In this context, timely and credible information about the outlook for energy supply and demand is vital to help energy suppliers and customers plan for future investment and arrangements for purchasing energy.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07102330000014"></a><I>Energy Markets Outlook</I>, which has been developed with the help of Ofgem and the National Grid, looks at security of supply and its drivers over a time horizon of up to 15 years. It covers electricity, gas and other fuels including coal, oil, nuclear fuel and renewables. It also looks at supply chain issues such as the availability of skilled staff, materials and labour for the construction and operation of new infrastructure, and the potential impact of the emerging carbon market on the security of electricity supply.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS66"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column WS66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07102330000015"></a>We are also launching an online resource, which contains additional detail on security of supply, including background analysis and links to other sources of information. This can be found at www.dti.gov.uk/energy/energymarketsoutlook/page41839.html and will be regularly updated.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07102330000016"></a>This initial report suggests significant medium-term opportunities for the construction of new electricity generation capacity in response to expected demand and forthcoming plant closures. This is consistent with the conclusion set out in the energy White Paper that around 20 to 25 GW of new generation will be required by 2020. Companies have already announced plans for over 14 GW of new generation.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07102330000017"></a>For the gas market, <I>Energy Markets Outlook</I> shows that delivery of new capacity and planned new infrastructure should more than compensate for reduction in indigenous production in the medium term. However, further investment will be needed to avoid market tightness around the middle of the next decade and in subsequent years. Alongside pipeline supplies, the global liquefied natural gas market provides an opportunity to access additional sources of gas on a more flexible basis.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07102330000018"></a>The initial report suggests that the future use of other fuels&#151;coal, oil and nuclear fuels&#151;is unlikely to be limited by resource availability in the near term, but acknowledges that these are finite resources in the longer term. It shows that maintaining security of supply while expanding the use of renewable energy sources is achievable, given the UK's extensive primary renewable resources, although this will involve some additional costs.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07102330000019"></a><I>Energy Markets Outlook</I> is the first stage in a dialogue between the Government, companies, market participants and other interested parties. The intention is to help develop a shared understanding of the longer-term outlook for energy supply and demand and of emerging risks that could affect security of supply.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07102330000020"></a>We hope that this report will help the UK's strong energy market respond to the challenges and opportunities for future energy supply.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07102330000022"></a>In a case brought by the European Commission against the European Parliament and the Council, the European Court of Justice has decided that for the purposes of European law, three benefits&#151;disability living allowance (care component), attendance allowance and carers allowance&#151;are incorrectly classified as special non-contributory benefits.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07102330000023"></a>This means that these disability benefits may, in certain circumstances, be paid to some people who move from the UK to live in another member state of the European economic area.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="07102330000027"></a><b><a name="71023-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07102330000039"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Parmjit Dhanda) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07102330000028"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities is today publishing further proposed changes to the east of England plan (also known as the draft revision to the regional spatial strategy for the east of England) for eight weeks&#146; public consultation. The further proposed changes take account of the habitats directive assessment of the plan&#146;s effects on sites protected under the European habitats directive. The report of the habitats directive carried out by planning consultants, RPS, is also being published for consultation.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07102330000029"></a>The further proposed changes are additional to and, in a small number of cases, modify the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes to the east of England plan, which were published for consultation in December 2006.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07102330000030"></a>An initial assessment of the plan under the habitats directive which was carried out by environmental consultants, ERM, was published with the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes in December 2006. That piece of work was among the first assessments of regional spatial strategy against the directive, following the October 2005 decision by the European Court of Justice that development plans and regional spatial strategy in England need to be assessed against the requirements of the habitats directive. ERM considered the likely significant effects of the plan on such sites and concluded that an appropriate assessment&#151;the more detailed assessment stage under the directive&#151;was not required.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS68"></a><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column WS68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07102330000031"></a>Over 19,700 separate representations were submitted in response to the proposed changes, and a small number of these challenged the conclusions of the habitats directive assessment in relation to a number of European sites. Having considered the points made in relation this matter, including those put by the Regional Assembly for the East of England and Natural England, the Government Office for the East of England commissioned further work by RPS to assess the east of England plan against the habitats directive, culminating in an appropriate assessment of a number of the plan&#146;s policies. RPS have also produced a short supplementary report on the implications of their work for the sustainability appraisal of the plan.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07102330000032"></a>This further work has now been carried out and, in the light of it, the Secretary of State is now proposing to make a small number of further changes to the plan. By consulting for a further eight weeks on those changes, and on the habitats directive report, the Government aim to ensure that the final plan will be fully compliant with the directive.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07102330000033"></a>The further changes relate to the protection of sites of European or international importance for wildlife, and are proposed principally to avoid giving rise to likely effects on such sites or to mitigate any possible adverse effects. Whilst some of the changes identify possible constraints to growth, notably at Thetford, or highlight infrastructure constraints which need to be addressed, notably in regard to sewage treatment capacity for Stevenage, Harlow and Welwyn, the assessment has not given rise to any fundamental change of policy. The broad aims of the strategy remain, as before, to provide for 508,000 dwellings to 2021 and for the further increase in housing provision required through the housing Green Paper to be delivered through a further partial review of the regional spatial strategy, covering the period to 2031.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07102330000034"></a>I have today written to the East of England Regional Assembly with the further proposed changes. The public consultation period will end on 14 December 2007. Following consideration of responses to the consultation on the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes and these further proposed changes, the Secretary of State is expected to publish the finalised east of England plan in early 2008.</p>

<a name="71023-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07102330000035"></a>Copies of the relevant documents, together with copies of the report of the European habitats directive appropriate assessment, are available in the Libraries of both Houses and have been provided for all of the region&#146;s MPs, MEPs, and local authorities.</p>

<a name="71023w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="07102331000035"></a>The localised nature of the outbreak, which has so far been successfully contained within a small area of Surrey, has meant that there has no significant impact on the national visitor economy. However, it is too early to make a definitive assessment, and longer term work will be necessary to assess the full effects of the outbreak alongside such other factors as the poor summer weather, the strong pound and the increase in visa fees for inbound visitors earlier this year. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will be working to that end over the next few months with the tourism industry.</p>

<a name="71023w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="07102331000036"></a>Bluetongue is a very different disease from foot and mouth. It cannot be transmitted directly between animals, or by human agents. There is therefore no reason to close any parts of the countryside, and no significant impact on tourism businesses is expected.</p>

<a name="71023w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="07102331000037"></a>However, the Government fully recognise that the farming community is suffering as a result of both forms of outbreak, and that many rural businesses are based on both farming and tourism. The impacts of the outbreaks will, therefore, continue to be monitored carefully.</p>
