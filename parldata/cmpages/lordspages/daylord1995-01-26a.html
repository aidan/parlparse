<H4><center>The House met at three of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they accept the recommendation of the House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee that listed sporting events should not become available exclusively on subscription satellite or cable television services.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   No, my Lords. The Government believe that sporting rights owners should be able to realise the full market value of their events and should be allowed to judge the balance between the level of income from the broadcasting rights, the size of the television audience, the amount and type of coverage and the impact on potential spectators and players. A copy of the Government's full response to the Select Committee is in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for reporting that rather unfortunate decision. Will she inform the Secretary of State that the free market and selling to the highest bidder is not the only issue at stake here? Will she tell him that the basic principle of guaranteed national access to great national sporting events is of great importance and that the Government, in eroding that principle&#151;a principle set out in the Broadcasting Act 1990 and reaffirmed by the all-party committee&#151;will cause great unhappiness to the millions of elderly, poor and unemployed people who cannot afford to pay the price of subscribing to Murdoch's satellite subscription channels? Will she ask the Secretary of State to reconsider this decision?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, with regard to people on fixed incomes, the Government can understand and sympathise. But, on the other hand, the organisers of events and the holders of broadcasting rights want to be able to sell the rights to obtain what they believe to be the best advantage. When the list was drawn up certain events were included. A new list of events was drawn up by the then Home Secretary in April 1991. There are eight events on the list. They are: cricket Test matches involving England; the Derby; the FIFA World Cup finals; the FA Cup final; the Grand National; the Olympic Games; the final weekends of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships; and, additionally, in Scotland, the Scottish FA Cup final. Recommendation No. 8 of the committee's report was accepted and the list will be kept under review. It would be impractical to seek to protect through any statutory listing system coverage of every sporting or other event.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that my noble friend Lord Donoughue is correct <P>


<a name="column_1176"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that under the present legislation, as it is being applied by the Government, there are two different sets of viewers&#151;those who can afford to see these events and those who will never be able to afford to see these events which are the prerogative of Sky Television? Will the noble Baroness seriously consider pleading with the Home Secretary to reconsider the decision in order to make it a completely national franchise and not a selective one?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is wrong. It is no longer the responsibility of the Home Secretary. It is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for National Heritage. I shall, of course, ensure that my right honourable friend reads this part of Hansard from cover to cover. Consumer choice is being enhanced by the introduction of specialist sports channels increasing the extent and variety of sports coverage on television services generally. Satellite services have provided for the first time live ball-by-ball coverage of overseas Test matches involving England. There is still plenty of sport on terrestrial television.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that since the advent of satellite television there has been very much more sport of all kinds on television and in particular some of the minority sports which were never shown on terrestrial television beforehand? Is not the income from satellite broadcasting very welcome indeed to those sporting associations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to thank him, as vice-chairman of the Sports and Arts Foundation, for the marvellous work that it does. He has made an important point. Sky now shows martial arts, snowboarding, powerboat racing, ten-pin bowling, equestrianism, vintage auto-racing and a montage of fringe sports.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness clarify her earlier remarks and the list she gave of what the previous Secretary of State said in 1991 would be available to all television companies? Does her answer mean that the Government have decided that that list can be eroded if satellite television wishes to do it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   No, my Lords, that is not what I said. I said that the list will be kept under review and that it would be impractical to seek to protect through any statutory listing system coverage of every sporting or other event. That is in the acceptances sent by the Secretary of State to the committee. That is No. 8.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Aberdare: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that those of us who are associated with the Football Trust are delighted at the Home Secretary's announcement yesterday that the pools companies are to be allowed to advertise on television and radio?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, that is not exactly pertinent to this particular Question, but again it gives me an excellent opportunity to comment on the <P>


<a name="column_1177"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wonderful work done by the Football Trust. I believe that my noble friend is chairman of that organisation. If he is delighted, then so am I.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Airedale: </B>   My Lords, it appears from the Broadcasting Act 1990 that the Secretary of State, in compiling his list of great sporting events, has completely unfettered control, is answerable to nobody and can change the list of sporting events at will without being answerable in any way to anybody. Is that the case, and do the Government believe that that is a satisfactory situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, when the list was drawn up the Government gave broadcasters the opportunity to comment. They consulted the Sports Council and the Central Council of Physical Recreation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Perth: </B>   My Lords, I do not fully understand the answers given by the noble Baroness. Is it right that the list she read out of events which are at present not exclusive to the television service or anything else will continue in that way, or is it possible that for the future they can say "We are going to keep them all to ourselves and nobody else can have them"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   No, my Lords. If we are talking about the list, as I have already said, it will be kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness now answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Airedale?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew16"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Next Question!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness does not understand the question. The noble Lord is asking whether the present position will remain and those sports will continue to be available. Will that list still be available to everyone?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, yes.

<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Molloy </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to promote an understanding of science and technology among the Members of both Houses of Parliament.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the Government have sponsored a large variety of initiatives under the campaign which they launched in January last year to promote greater understanding and appreciation of science, engineering and technology. The aim of the campaign is to reach all members of society, including of course Members of both Houses of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, I compliment the noble Baroness on her elevation to the Front Bench. I hope that she will have an exceedingly worthwhile job while she is there. I also thank thank her for her reply, which was very useful indeed. Is she aware that the scientific office and POST do remarkably good work, but that <P>


<a name="column_1178"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their activities do not seem intensive enough? Is she further aware that businessmen involved in science and technology would like to see a larger department of state giving them and their employees more information? Can that be considered? Perhaps a sub-department of state could be created with particular emphasis on examining defence. That would be of help to British businessmen involved in science and technology.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his gracious remarks. I am glad that he commends, as I do, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. As regards the office being made larger, we believe that it is already probably large enough. But there is no reason at all why one cannot put forward to that office more suggestions for further discussions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Porter of Luddenham: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that it may now be rather late to teach many of us old dogs new tricks? Does she further agree that the problem started many years ago when we were 16 years of age or even earlier, with the narrowness of our educational system? Is she aware of the proposals that have been put forward by the Royal Society, the British Academy, the Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry and the Confederation of British Industry, to name but a few, which would promote a common understanding of science and technology and the arts from the age of 16 and for the rest of life? Have the Government any plans to implement these many proposals?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Porter, may be right in saying that perhaps some of us are too old to learn new tricks, but he certainly learnt his tricks very well when he was younger because he is very distinguished. I understand that he has a Nobel Prize for Chemistry. I believe that the noble Lord will agree with me that this question is rather wide of the original Question, but the noble Lord was courteous in that he gave me advance notice of it. I have made one or two inquiries. I am happy to tell him that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and her Ministers are engaged in a debate with those concerned with the qualification structure for those aged 16 years of age and upwards. Indeed, meetings have been arranged already with most of the groups which the noble Lord mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Platt of Writtle: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware of the quality and variety of reports that come from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, covering such subjects as radiotherapy and cancer treatment, urban air pollution, and national identity card technology? They are available to all Members of both Houses of Parliament and provide very good background material to those who need an understanding of science and technology if they are to consider a wide variety of solutions to the problems of the day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Platt for bringing that point to our attention. I have a list of all those publications with me, but it would take far too long to read it out. <P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, your Lordships might like to know that only 21 Members of this House have listed science and technology as an interest and that only 27 Members of another place have done so. However, the fact is that 250 Members of both Houses receive the material to which my noble friend referred. The list is still open to any other Member who would like to receive such material.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dainton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that this House participates in and contributes financially to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which serves both Houses? Indeed, we do so as a result of a recommendation of some two-and-a-half years ago from the Library and Computers Sub-Committee of this House. The noble Baroness may not be aware that there is a great deal of anxiety about the fact that that preliminary agreement runs out in 1996. We hope very much that that office will continue. Perhaps the noble Baroness will give her weight to seeking to secure the continuance of that office, which, as has already been mentioned, is valuable from all points of view. Is the noble Baroness aware that this House has been unique in establishing its own Select Committee on Science and Technology, which produces reports which carry a great deal of weight, and which has done so for well over 10 years?
<P>

<a name="50126-02_para0"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness may or may not be aware that there are yet other sources of information. I refer to the professional bodies which have already responded to the needs of Parliament by setting up committees specifically to produce documents which are available to Members of both Houses. They are also very willing to brief us. I refer to bodies such as the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics. There is no lack of sources of information. Although these are early days, it is absolutely essential to continue to support such efforts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the points which the noble Lord has raised. In 1992, both Houses of Parliament accepted the recommendation of the House of Commons Information Committee that Parliament should provide funding for the work of POST for three years from 1993 to 1996. It is not a government body and both Houses will have to consider the extension of financial support for POST after April 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware of the work of two other all-party parliamentary associations with which I am involved? I refer to the Parliamentary Information Technology Committee, which is part of that on science and technology. It has been going for 10 years and currently has 97 members across both Houses. I refer also to EURIN, which was formed only a year ago and deals with the European aspects of information technology. It is in its first year but now has 75 members: 39 Members of Parliament, 14 Members of the European Parliament&#151;which we think is extremely important for the future since the <P>


<a name="column_1180"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>European Parliament is gaining in power&#151;and 22 Peers. I think my noble friend will agree that there is a lot of scientific knowledge in this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for bringing all that information to the attention of this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ironside: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that if Members are interested in science, they can always join the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her answers. Does she agree that there seems to be great interest in science and technology on all sides of the House? There is massive interest outside. All I am asking is that the noble Baroness will consider all that has been said here this afternoon to see whether some improvements can be made in the arrangements whereby those outside Parliament can have contact with the Members of both Houses on this subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I shall do so.

<A NAME="50126-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Montagu of Beaulieu </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they expect London to be relieved of the congestion caused by the utility and road works currently being undertaken.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport   (Viscount Goschen): </B>  My Lords, essential maintenance and new construction work on transport infrastructure and below ground services must continue if London is to prosper in the future. Inevitably this will continue to cause inconvenience to road users and others. However, following the enactment of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, both the utilities and highway authorities are working hard to implement its new co-ordination arrangements to minimise congestion and delays.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Montagu of Beaulieu: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer, but does he agree that motorists might be forgiven for assuming that that new Act, which was so warmly welcomed in this House as a step forward, is either not working or is not being enforced? Is my noble friend also aware that drivers are becoming increasingly frustrated at hearing every week about more and more threatened restrictions on motoring in London, given that the congestion is caused by other factors? I refer, for example, to the incredible fact that 300,000 holes are dug in Westminster every year and that 60,000 miles of cable TV are being laid at the moment, all of which is unsupervised and causing even worse congestion. So when can Londoners&#151;<P>


<a name="column_1181"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pedestrians and motorists&#151;look forward to an end to that nightmare of congestion that is far worse than was caused by Hitler's bombs in World War II?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, it is important to realise that many of the works described by my noble friend are either urgent maintenance work that is being carried out by the utilities or openings of the roads to fix major emergencies such as gas leaks. The Government have a strong interest in reducing congestion in London and in keeping the traffic flowing. I believe that the new Act will be a big step towards that once its provisions have had a proper chance to be implemented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that across wide areas of London the problems of congestion come not from the public utilities or the necessity for repairing the roads but from the private cable companies which appear to be able to conduct their activities free of any kind of control whatever? They not only cause grave congestion, but in many areas come back a fortnight later to duplicate the business all over again. Has the noble Viscount, either as a Minister or via the local authorities, any control whatever over the activities of those private cable companies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-02_spnew17"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, yes, the noble Lord is not correct to say that those activities are uncontrolled. The cable TV companies generally operate under licence from the Department of Trade and Industry. That gives those companies many of the statutory powers that are available to the larger established utilities. In the same way as the utilities, they are required to give advance notice of their works to the highway authority. They have a duty to co-operate with that authority and one another in the same way as the utilities.

<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I cannot verify, or otherwise, my noble friend's claim about the state of the roads since the war.

<a name="column_1182"></a>

<A NAME="50126-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, do those private non-utility cable companies pay any compensation to the local authorities concerned? That would at least allow council tax to be reduced slightly, which would be some consolation to the afflicted residents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to find out that piece of information. I have explained that those companies are under a duty to notify the highway authority and to co-ordinate with the other utilities. It is important to note that many people value the services that the cable companies provide. It is not just cable television but a range of other services such as telephone and information that comes down the cables.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, the House will be astonished that the Minister has not announced the usual recipe for dealing with critical situations. Perhaps he will indicate why not. The usual recipe is, of course, for the Government to set up a quango, people it with their friends, including a chairman at a salary of &#163;450,000 a year. Does the Minister recognise that this is a serious matter which is causing a great deal of concern, notwithstanding the fact that the Act to which he referred has not come fully into operation? Will he give an undertaking that the Government will carry out some inquiries into the situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord feels that the local authorities are doing a bad job in maintaining the highways for which they are responsible. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is obviously responsible for maintenance on the trunk roads. We place great store on reducing congestion and getting traffic moving in London. I believe that the co-ordination provisions of the New Roads and Street Works Act will make a great difference to the situation.

<A NAME="50126-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  My Lords, a council tax defaulter may be imprisoned only in cases of wilful refusal to pay or culpable neglect, and after account is taken of means. The Government are conscious of the particular needs of disabled people. We have today issued a consultation paper which proposes that dwellings which are occupied solely by people who are severely mentally impaired should from 1st April 1995 be exempt from the council tax.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for that response. I had no knowledge of that proposal before I asked the Question. On the other hand, I should still like to stress the point that there must be something seriously wrong with a situation whereby a man who is physically and mentally handicapped and suffering from cancer can be gaoled for 28 days. Because it is not a criminal charge, he would not be entitled to report his condition to the magistrates. The magistrates could pass sentence in his absence, and he would be found guilty of a charge and debt which he might be totally unable to comprehend. Does the Minister agree that that could still happen, even with the announcement that he has just made?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew17"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the noble Lord. The Government share the noble Lord's anxiety for people with disabilities. I hope that the proposed changes in the council tax liability regulations that I have just announced will alleviate those anxieties. The committal of debtors is very much the last resort and should be used only when people have not met their commitments, and other enforcement measures have proved to be inappropriate or unsuccessful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that the Government are anxious to avoid these unfortunate cases in the future, would my noble friend consider it helpful if somehow, when such cases arise again, the local government welfare officer was informed by the court and was asked to see what he could do to help?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew19"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, before the magistrates use their powers, they must try to find out all the circumstances of the case. It is only in rare instances where they are persuaded that there is some form of culpable neglect or wilful refusal that such a committal can be made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister reconsider the answer he has just given? Some disturbing cases are being reported in the newspapers, including cases of single mothers who have made an offer to pay and who are then imprisoned although there is no provision for care for their children, and also cases, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, of people <P>


<a name="column_1184"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unable to make provision for disabled relatives once they are sent to prison. Given that the High Court has intervened on more than one occasion to overrule magistrates who have sent such debtors to prison, can the Minister make further inquiries to ensure that we do not revert to the 18th century structure of debtors' prisons?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew21"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the Magistrates' Association is taking seriously reports that some magistrates have not been adequately advised or trained in the use of powers to imprison people for non-payment of the community charge or council tax. The Government share those anxieties and therefore welcome the association's announcement that it will be studying Mr. Justice Turner's judgment, and issuing further guidance to magistrates as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, is not the problem that the magistrates are not informed of the situation of the persons coming before the bench? Unless there is some procedure whereby the individual concerned can inform the bench of the disability or the disadvantage, the magistrates have to act in ignorance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew23"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, if there is no show from the defendant, that puts the magistrates in a difficult position. Again, I should have thought that the further advice of the Magistrates' Association would go a long way towards assisting in this matter.

<P>

<a name="50126-03_para6"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 20 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-03_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   It may appear to the Committee that this is a negative Motion. I raise it largely because I want to emphasise the importance of the arguments put forward on Second Reading and at other times in support of the SEPA, many of which I believe to be false. The establishment of the SEPA will result in the ousting of the control of potentially polluting processes, and a lack of local presence on the enforcing authorities and a lack of points of contact for advice, which currently exist through the local authorities, particularly through locally elected representatives.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para7"></a>I favour a genuine Scottish environmental protection commission operating in partnership with local government and covering a wider range of services. <P>


<a name="column_1185"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They should include coastal protection and flood prevention, which would be most apposite in Scotland after the serious damage caused two or three weeks ago. The proposed timing for the establishment of the agency could not be worse when viewed against the background of the upheaval that will be caused by the implementation of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para8"></a>If it is inevitable that a single body is to take over pollution control, the Health and Safety Commission provides the best model for achieving that. The commission, which includes a local elected member, enjoys the benefits of a policy overview, with enforcement being shared between central government and local authorities. The uniformity of enforcement is assured to a great extent by the existence of the Health and Safety Executive and the local authorities association enforcement liaison committee and its various sub-committees.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para9"></a>The use of a commission model would seem to satisfy the objectives of both central and local government and should be further investigated. Such a commission could be engaged in policy formulation and research and development, leading to the development and auditing of minimum environmental standards.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para10"></a>Instead, the Government have proposed a narrowly focused, service-providing regulatory agency, which will have great difficulty in moving beyond its purely pollution control remit to take on the much broader agenda of sustainable development. The allied concepts of integrated pollution control and the polluter-pays principle must be the guiding force behind the work of any agency involved in the field.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para11"></a>The Government's strictures on the need to relieve the burden of costs on industry cuts right across that. I do not want industry to have additional or unreasonable costs, but someone must pay for the costs of pollution. If that is not industry, the local authority and the local people must pay. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 recognised the proper role of local authorities in giving them new powers in relation to the control of certain areas of pollution and the management of solid waste disposal. Despite the commitment of authorities in preparing to undertake their new task, it is proposed that those should be absorbed by the SEPA. That hardly indicates an integrated approach to the legislative process. It is widely believed, in particular by those in Scotland who are knowledgeable about pollution issues, that the system of pollution control provided for in the 1990 Act achieves an optimum level of integration.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para12"></a>Authorities have restructured departments and increased staffing levels to meet the new more specialised responsibilities. Staff in local authorities are not only capable of undertaking the new duties but also possess the expertise to look at issues of public health and environmental protection on a global basis. They are also able to respond positively and comprehensively to all environmental matters, and those such as building control and health and safety functions, giving them the ability to deal effectively with issues closely related to <P>


<a name="column_1186"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the duties that the SEPA seeks to absorb. The net result is that if the SEPA is established it is likely to be a poorer and less effective service.
<P>

<a name="50126-03_para13"></a>It is sad that, after all that work, we shall produce a less effective body and I oppose the Question that Clause 20 shall stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Do we not have a ministerial response to this Question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Yes. While I stand at the Dispatch Box I represent the Minister, and therefore I am the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para0"></a>Clause 20 establishes the Scottish environment protection agency to carry out the functions assigned to it elsewhere in the Bill. SEPA would bring together responsibility for the prevention and control of the key forms of pollution to air, water and land. The functions that will be transferred are set out in Clause 21.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para1"></a>It is widely recognised that an integrated approach to pollution prevention and control is essential. Pollution to one environmental media can affect another. At present, however, our environmental regulators are organised separately. Pollution to air, water and land are dealt with in isolation to each other.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, suggested that the transition to the new arrangements would represent a loosening on the control of pollution. That will not be the case. The constituent parts that will be brought into SEPA have to date performed extremely well in their own rights and they will be absorbed in the functioning systems. The polluter-pays principle will be maintained and enforced where necessary. SEPA will instead offer a one-door approach to pollution prevention and control to the benefit of both the environment and industry.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para3"></a>The noble Lord suggested that pollution control could be styled on a commission, such as the HSC. The HSC works with three distinct partners; industry, government and the workers. To a large extent, policy is already settled. The problem with using such a model for the environmental protection agency is that much environmental policy is still being settled or must be allowed to evolve. Therefore, policy is best left to an arrangement between government and an agency.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para4"></a>I stress to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, that despite the pollution prevention function, which is at the centre of SEPA's existence, the agency is not precluded from seeking to improve the environment. The existing river purification authorities have successfully proved that during the past few years.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para5"></a>SEPA will be a non-departmental public body. We believe that it is within this organisational framework that a body such as SEPA will best operate. It will be one stage removed from the day-to-day work of government, but it will also remain accountable to Parliament through my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, raised other issues relating to the relationship between SEPA and local authorities. The first group of amendments on the Marshalled List today deals with that matter in detail and therefore I shall not go into the detail immediately. <P>


<a name="column_1187"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 20 brings into effect Schedule 6, which sets out the constitution and proceedings of SEPA. I therefore recommend that Clause 20 shall stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Is the Minister aware that there is a widespread belief that this new organisation represents no more than the centralisation of current pollution control arrangements? There is no confidence that the agency will be one for the protection of the environment, to which the noble Earl is devoted. On the contrary, the loss of the local nature of waste regulation, air pollution control and river purification is bound to lead to a much greater potential for pollution. How can the noble Earl say that this is an advance in environmental protection when it is a retreat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I do not know whether the exchange is intended to be only a duet; but I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will bear in mind advantages which flow from the arrangements. At present, a host of authorities set standards and people conducting business in Scotland have to apply to each one. Each is able to apply different standards, and each must give permission for activity in its area. There is a general principle, which is satisfied by the Bill, which would not be satisfied without Clause 20; it is that there should be a single agency and a single point of application for permissions and licences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, always supports the Government on these matters. That is perfectly reasonable. He sits on the Conservative Benches, and why should he not do so? But the fact is that there are local variations in relation to the protection of waste regulation, air pollution control and river purification. To say that there should be one Scottish body because it is useful for somebody to be able to telephone one telephone number does not seem to me to hold any confidence at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I rise only to thank the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for that glowing testimony, which I draw to the attention, through the record, of my party's Chief Whip.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The noble Lord made two principal points, both of which I think are inaccurate. The first is that very few people now with an interest in the environmental field do not believe that an integrated approach to environmental management, the prevention and control of pollution and then enhancement of environmental issues is the right method. To deal with different environmental needs in isolation from each other is seen by very few people as correct.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para7"></a>The second point I stress to the noble Lord is that many issues have a certain complexion which must be taken into account when they are managed. SEPA has a duty to appoint regional boards. That is not an option but a duty. Those regional boards will have executive functions delegated to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am sorry to prolong the debate but the noble Earl cannot have it both ways. We cannot have the noble Lord, Lord Elton, saying that a central body is of the greatest advantage to the people of Scotland while at the same time the noble Earl says <P>


<a name="column_1188"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there will be regional boards all over the place which will take account of all the different variations. It must be one thing or the other.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I cannot agree with the noble Lord. I believe that my view is shared by many Members of the Committee. There is a need for centralised cohesion, co-ordination and integration but very often there needs to be localised input to take account of local factors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I am disappointed by the noble Earl's reply, although I did not expect him to agree with me as that would have been very damaging to the Bill. Existing bodies are looking after pollution control reasonably well but would do so a great deal better were there to be one co-ordinating body bringing them together with their representatives who have direct contact with the people and who know, perhaps better even than the scientists, what are the local pollution problems. I am very disappointed but I shall not oppose the Motion.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para8"></a>On Question, Clause 20 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para9"></a>Schedule 6 [The Scottish Environment Protection Agency]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  I should point out to the Committee that if Amendment No. 131 is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 132 to 135 inclusive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove </B>   moved Amendment No. 131:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 134, leave out lines 13 to 36 and insert:
<br>
("( ) SEPA shall consist of elected members appointed by such associations of local authorities as exist.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-04_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 140, 143, 144, 145, 146 and 181C. The amendments seek to ensure that members of SEPA are elected members of the new councils when they are formed. During our discussions on the Bill, I have emphasised the need for SEPA to have as its members people who are known locally and who have to be elected periodically. It is important that the control of the SEPA remains in the hands of local people who are democratically accountable. The only feasible way in which to achieve such an end is to require that membership of the agency is drawn from local authority members. It is not sufficient that the members of the agency should, as suggested in the schedule,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have knowledge or experience in some matter relevant to the functions".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para11"></a>That is far too wide a definition. The vital point is that decisions should be taken by elected members who are democratically accountable and who appear regularly before their electors.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para12"></a>Amendment No. 140 seeks to ensure that democratic accountability of the membership on the boards is retained. As I said, it is vital that decisions are taken by democratically elected members.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para13"></a>Amendment No. 143 seeks to retain the function of waste regulation within local authority control. The schedule is not strengthening the organisation of <P>


<a name="column_1189"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>environmental protection in Scotland; the proposals merely seek to supplant the operational aspects of pollution control work which, in the view of most of us in Scotland, are matters for locally based personnel who are locally accountable. It is important that that matter should remain close to the industries and communities with which and within which it operates.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para14"></a>District and highland councils in Scotland have, since 1975, been responsible for waste regulation, first in terms of control of pollution under the 1974 Act and since May 1994 under the waste management licensing regulations which brought into force the licensing provisions of Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Even now consultations are taking place to amend the regulations and to revise the associated waste management functions. No justification has been offered for the removal of that function from local government.
<P>

<a name="50126-04_para15"></a>I commend also Amendment No. 144 which seeks to ensure that the regulatory functions of waste disposal authorities are retained within local control. The other amendments are on the same theme. I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is for local government to be represented in matters which affect everyone in the locality. Local government members are the best people to be contacted when things go wrong. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   I support the amendment. I should have thought that the more democratic control we have, the better it will be. It is not to be expected that the Government will be very enthusiastic about that, particularly in Scotland where they have even less representation in local government than they do in England. Nevertheless, whatever the political control, it is right that the people, the voters, should have a say as to who runs that very important agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I support the amendment. We must be very clear about the responsibilities of SEPA. I understand that it is to ensure the protection and enhancement of the environment in Scotland. That is for the benefit, I assume, of people living in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para0"></a>The difficulty with which we are faced is that the agency will be answerable to the Secretary of State. I am sure that the noble Earl will say that it will be the Secretary of State for Scotland. But he is a national Minister. He is a Minister of a national government and therefore has to take cognisance of what is best for the UK as a whole and not just what is best for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para1"></a>If the Government were to change the way in which the Secretary of State for Scotland is chosen so that Scottish Members of Parliament elect who is to be the Secretary of State for Scotland, I am sure that we should all welcome the proposals in the Bill. But I suspect that the Government will not do that. Therefore, the problem is that the people who are to be responsible for environment and pollution control in Scotland will not be answerable to the Scottish people; they will be answerable to a national government. There is a contradiction which I believe needs to be addressed. <P>


<a name="column_1190"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Obviously, the best way that we have to address it at present is to support the amendment moved by my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I think it is time that a Scottish-based Peer entered into this short debate. I must tell the noble Lord who has just spoken that what he said constitutes a most interesting and different form of Scottish nationalism which, perhaps, he would like to discuss some time during debate. It is quite strange, and if the noble Lord came a little more often to Scotland I believe that he would realise just how strange it is.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para2"></a>However, having said that, I know that the noble Lord is trying to be constructive and is representing the interests of local government in the matter of which he has knowledge and in which he is very interested. I, too, am most interested in it. In his response, I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister can outline a little to the Committee how the local government interest in such matters will link with the interests of SEPA. That is a critical question. In other words, we need to know how the powers, which to an extent overlap, will operate and how people who go to their local government councillors about a problem will be dealt with. I believe that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, has in mind.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para3"></a>I do not believe that the magic solution of political control of SEPA is the probable answer. But it is extremely important that local government people should know how they are to relate to the agency. I have not given my noble friend notice of that question, but I should be most grateful if he could assist us in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I should like to intervene for a moment, drawing from my practical experience of having, off and on, close contact with the river purification boards that presently exist in Scotland. One-third of the membership of those boards was appointed by the Secretary of State. Over the past 30 years it has been very much my opinion that those members who were appointed by the Secretary of State were by far the most active. That is not meant in any way as a criticism of the representatives who were appointed by local authorities. But, of course, local authority councillors had many other duties to attend to and, in many cases, did not have the time to address their extra duties&#151;it I may put it that way&#151;of being members of a river purification board.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para4"></a>With very great respect to our elected councillors, many of whom are extremely dedicated people regardless of political party, I must stress that when it comes to environmental matters I believe it is important for us to have people who have the greatest experience in the field, and not necessarily locally-elected personnel.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   If the noble Lord is thinking of this as more than a probing amendment, I believe that it would probably be worth his while to explain how it is that the wording, which would appear to be designed to replace only paragraph 4 of the schedule, actually strikes out paragraphs 3 to 7, thus leaving the size of SEPA and <P>


<a name="column_1191"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the method of appointment, the duration of appointment and the actual role of the Secretary of State completely unstated. I do not believe that that point is picked up in the rest of the group, although there may be something that I have missed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   During her remarks, the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, referred to my local government experience. I thank her for doing so. However, I should have advised Members of the Committee of a vested interest in the matter. I was educated in Scotland and I have relatives in Scotland. One of the things that I like doing in Scotland is swimming. Indeed I like swimming off the beach of Portobello in Edinburgh and I also like swimming off the Western Isles.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para5"></a>My vested interest is in ensuring that bathing water is clean. We have only to look at the history of the past few years to realise that our national Government do not seem to have that as a very high priority. I am concerned for the people of Scotland and, as I said, I want nice, clean bathing water when I go swimming. I want to ensure that the Scottish people have control, so to speak, of SEPA so that they are looking after their vested interests. That would ensure the best for the people of Scotland. It must not be controlled by the national Government here in Westminster who, unfortunately, still seem to like this country to go under the epithet of "the dirty man of Europe". I hope that that helps the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I do not want to prolong the debate, but I expect that the noble Lord appreciates the fact that beaches have, for a long time, been the responsibility of local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-05_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   We are discussing a most important part of the Bill; and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, raises a most important issue. The amendments seek to involve local authorities in the work of SEPA. Yet, at the same time, they seek to remove from the proposed scope of the agency those functions currently carried out by local authorities in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para6"></a>Amendment No. 131 would mean that SEPA would only comprise of local councillors who, in effect, would be appointed by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA). I would certainly not rule out that appointments to the SEPA board made on the basis of merit, and the contributions that could be made to the effective running of the agency, may well include some individuals from local authorities. However, I cannot accept that that group should have an exclusive right of membership.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para7"></a>It has been suggested that the amendment would make the agency more accountable. I am not sure whether I accept that that would be the exact case. CoSLA is not itself elected and any representatives appointed to SEPA would not be accountable to their electors for that work. That is not to say that individuals with experience of local government may not have much to offer, but they would be appointed for their personal <P>


<a name="column_1192"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>qualities and, most important, those appointments would not be made simply because their status is that of a councillor.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para8"></a>It would be very difficult for this non-departmental public body to be accountable to the Secretary of State, and through him to Parliament, if he was not responsible for appointing the members of the body. Choosing the members of the board is a crucial element of the Secretary of State's responsibility for the overall performance of the agency. I stress that point for the benefit of all noble Lords who are concerned that there may be a weakening of the democratic link between the operations of SEPA and those people who live in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para9"></a>It seems to me to be vital that the operation and performance of SEPA is properly accountable to Parliament. I should stress that the Secretary of State will be answerable for the agency's overall performance, the specific aspects of its work related to his responsibilities as set out in Clause 4 and the appointments he makes to it. If the appointments to the board and the regional boards were made by the local electorate, the responsibility of the Secretary of State to Parliament would be very much diminished.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para10"></a>However, no one doubts that there is very probably a role for elected councillors at different levels of SEPA. I have already described the duty that SEPA has to establish regional boards. The Government certainly envisage elected councillors playing a full part on regional boards. I emphasise that to both noble Lords opposite and my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour. Everyone acknowledges, especially in Scotland, the great role played by local authorities in environmental protection.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para11"></a>Amendment No. 140 would ensure that each of SEPA's regional boards included an elected councillor appointed by each local authority within its geographical area. I can envisage that the regional boards will, as I said, include a significant number of elected councillors. That will be included in the guidance which my right honourable friend gives to the agency. However, appointing one representative per authority could, in certain cases, make the regional boards unmanageably large as a wide range of interests would need to be reflected on the boards.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 would stop the transfer of local authorities' waste regulatory functions to SEPA. Amendment No. 145 would stop the transfer of local authority air pollution control to SEPA. Amendment No. 181C would remove integrated pollution control and local air pollution control from the list of SEPA's pollution control functions in Clause 31. In order to deliver environmental protection in a properly integrated manner it is important that the agency assumes responsibility for waste regulation. Another key benefit is the removal of dual responsibility for waste regulation and waste disposal. District and islands councils in Scotland currently perform both roles which effectively requires them to regulate themselves. Although this may not have caused serious problems to date, in principle there is a potential for conflict which need not exist.
<P>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para13"></a>The Bill also transfers local authority air pollution control to SEPA. In Scotland we believe the balance of advantage lies with this more integrated approach. It reflects the comparatively small number of air polluting processes in Scotland with many local authorities responsible for only a handful of them even after taking local government reorganisation in 1996 into account. In a country of Scotland's size it makes little sense to establish a 600-strong agency with all the facilities and back-up that that entails while the 25 or so local authority staff working on air pollution control remain dispersed across all the local authorities. Pooling resources will bring real benefits in an area which is becoming increasingly technical. I would point out to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, that integration of such skills is widely welcomed by environmental groups as well as others.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para14"></a>I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed over the transfer of local authority functions to SEPA, in particular the transfer of responsibility for local air pollution control under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act. The Government believe that local authorities will continue to play an important role in combating air pollution, even after the transfer. Indeed they will be assisted by the strengthened powers to tackle nuisance in Clause 89.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para15"></a>However, I can announce to the Committee today that regulations will be brought forward to make local authorities in Scotland statutory consultees for the prescribed processes which they currently regulate. I hope that the noble Lord welcomes that. The new arrangements will come into force when the air pollution controls are transferred to SEPA. They will ensure that local authorities continue to have a voice in the operation of such processes in their locality.
<P>

<a name="50126-05_para16"></a>In the meantime I can further announce that, as part of the Government's air quality initiative, local authorities in Scotland and in England and Wales will become statutory consultees for IPC processes from this April. The new consultation arrangements will remain in place after regulatory responsibility for IPC transfers to the new agencies. This is a measure which local government has been keen for us to introduce. I hope that it is welcome to all noble Lords who spoke on the need for links between SEPA, the regional boards and the local electors. I hope too that the two announcements will reassure the Committee of the important role which the Government believe local authorities should continue to have in environmental protection matters. On that basis I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50126-06_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I think he will find that the grouping of amendments includes Amendment No. 146 in the name of my noble friend Lord Ullswater. I presume that it is purely drafting but he did not say anything about it.

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do, I would say to my noble friend that I did not know he was going to make the announcement that local government will be statutory consultees in relation to SEPA. That is precisely what I was trying to get at when I asked him to tell the Committee&#151;I was waiting for an answer in his speech&#151;how the functions of local government and of SEPA which overlap will be taken care of. It seems to me that that is a good solution to the problem. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is pleased; I certainly am.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   The noble Earl has made the important announcement in response to the amendment that local authorities will be statutory consultees and that the Government will bring forward, I think he said, some statutory instrument to that effect. That is not only in the case of Scotland&#151;as I understood the noble Earl to say&#151;but also in the case of England and Wales. If I am wrong perhaps the noble Earl will correct me now. However, as I understood it, he included England and Wales as well. That is a very important announcement. I find it rather odd&#151;perhaps I should address the noble Viscount here&#151;that this important item comes in the middle of a debate about the Scottish environment protection agency. Leaving that aside, I assume that the Government will bring forward some sort of amendment at a later stage in the Bill to implement what we have been told. If I am wrong, the noble Earl, when he comes to speak again, will tell me.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para0"></a>I hope I may ask a question of the noble Earl relating to Amendment No. 145. I am not an expert in Scottish affairs. I have never pretended to be an expert in Scottish affairs. However, I am advised&#151;as the noble Earl, I think, said&#151;that air pollution powers were given to district and island councils quite recently. They have trained officers, and the new controls came into effect, I understand, on 1st April 1992 following a great deal of preparatory work. Apparently&#151;I say "apparently" because I am open to correction&#151;there has been no criticism of those local authorities in their carrying out of the work. It is rather odd, having given them all these powers and trained all the officers, that the functions should now be transferred to the new agency.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para1"></a>There is a second question to which I would ask the noble Earl to respond. He rightly says that air pollution is to be a matter for SEPA rather than local authorities in the future if the Government have their way but that this is not the case in England and Wales. He declared that Scotland in some way was different to England and Wales. I am not quite certain that I follow his argument as regards in what sense Scotland can be said to be different from Wales other than the fact that they are at different ends of the United Kingdom. The problems in Wales are more or less analogous to the problems in Scotland. Are we to take it, as a result of the noble Earl's arguments, that the Government are now prepared <P>


<a name="column_1195"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1195</B></P>

<P>
<A NAME="50126-06_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, asks a number of questions. As regards the two announcements made today, both of which I regard as being of great importance, one will involve regulations which will be brought forward. That is the one whereby local authorities in Scotland will be statutory consultees for the prescribed air pollution processes which they currently regulate. The other, I believe&#151;if I am incorrect, I shall make sure the noble Lord receives the correct information&#151;involves powers which already exist under Part I of the EPA Act 1990. To repeat, it allows local authorities in Scotland, England and Wales to become statutory consultees for IPC processes from this April. That is a duty they will enjoy both from April and through the EPA. The difference between Scotland, and England and Wales, on air pollution control is very marked. While Scotland has between perhaps 1,000 and 1,200 air emission processes which fall under the scope of the regulations, England and Wales have some 14,000. Therefore the scale of the problem and the management of the problem are rightly being handled in a very different way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   First of all I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Elton. I will look at what he said. It may well be that something has been missed in the Bill. I am sure that that has happened before. I shall certainly consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para2"></a>The situation would have been rather different if the announcement had been made earlier, but perhaps the amendments that we put down jogged the Government into providing a little more democracy. We are increasingly disturbed by the growth in the number of appointees. I believe that the country as a whole is becoming disturbed about the fact that there are these bodies which have such control over people's lives but which are accountable to nobody but the Secretary of State. People are conscious that these services are vital. We believe strongly that there should be contact with somebody on the board who can do something about those anxieties. What the noble Earl said may be helpful.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para3"></a>It seemed to me that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, was rather against local authorities and CoSLA for pushing these points through. I know that CoSLA is troublesome, but it is meant to be. The fact that its members are predominantly not members of the party opposite makes the matter more difficult. I suspect that some of the antagonism directed towards CoSLA is not at what it does but to its members.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para4"></a>I thank the Minister for giving us that information, even if it is rather late in the day. We shall study the regulations very carefully when they are available. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50126-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 136 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 137 to 139, 141, 159 to 161 and 173.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para8"></a>This group of amendments represents another strike for democracy. We want SEPA committee and board meetings to be open to the public. Most local authority committees are now open to the public. They attract a reasonable attendance because people are interested. The amendment would ensure local and general public accountability of SEPA's performance. It is also consistent with the Government's commitment under the European Union directive on freedom of access to information on the environment. I wonder whether the Government were aware of that when they prepared the Bill. That is the general tenor of this group of amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I rise to support Amendment No. 136 in particular. I believe that we could learn a lesson from the way in which this Chamber itself conducts its business in that we are all equal and we can all contribute to debates. When we come to a decision it is either a consensus or a democratically-determined decision. We are all part of that decision.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para9"></a>One of the difficulties of having the chair and deputy chair of SEPA appointed by the Secretary of State is that effectively it raises two members of that collective body into superior beings who are answerable to the Secretary of State, who has nominated them. That will devalue the other members of SEPA and what should be the collective nature of its decisions.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para10"></a>I implore the Government to think again and to bear in mind the positive benefits that would accrue from accepting my noble friend's amendment. As I said, we can seek no better example than the operation of our own Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-06_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, seeks to strike for democracy once again. In drafting the Bill I hope that the Government have anticipated some of the anxieties which the amendments raise.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para11"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. 136 and 137 is to take responsibility for the appointment of SEPA's chairman and deputy chairman away from my right honourable friend and place it in the hands of the agency board itself. The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, also focused on that area. I remind the Committee that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State is in any case responsible for all the appointments to the SEPA <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>board. Therefore, any difference would be marginal should the chairman and deputy chairman be elected rather than appointed.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para12"></a>The critical issue is that the chain of responsibility from the chairman to the Secretary of State and through him to Parliament is kept intact and is not diminished in any way.
<P>

<a name="50126-06_para13"></a>The chairman of SEPA is also likely to have a high public profile. That is another reason why, for strategic reasons, his appointment must be made in line with the wider scheme of SEPA's operations.

<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Are we now to assume that the Secretary of State will appoint the chairman of SEPA and that he will not be elected by the members, who I agree under the terms of the Bill will themselves be appointed by the Secretary of State? Are we to assume from what the noble Earl has just said that because the chairman of SEPA will be a high profile public figure it is important that a Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland should appoint such a person, and should perhaps give him a generous contract? Are we not to say that a future Labour Secretary of State for Scotland can reverse that appointment? Are we saying that the appointment will be made by a Member of Parliament for somewhere or other who happens to be Secretary of State for Scotland and that when the Bill becomes an Act the appointment will not be reversible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I do not know the terms and conditions of the appointment. However, whoever is the Secretary of State at the time will have the power to appoint the chairman, the deputy chairman and the other members of the SEPA main board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. I do not want to prolong the discussion, but before the Bill leaves your Lordships' House, let alone this Committee, will we know the terms and conditions of the appointment of the chairman of SEPA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I shall certainly endeavour to get all the relevant information to the noble Lord so that he can consider it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I hope that my noble friend will not be persuaded that, as in America, if there is a change of government there should be a change in chairmen of all the agencies dependent on the government, as there is of sheriffs and so on the moment the whistle goes. We all know of the steady process of erosion of appointments made by one party by its successor, but that is at the end of the term of the contract of employment. I watch the noble Lord's face with great interest as I make these remarks because it shows me his view of how the politics of this country work. It is not the same as mine.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The appointment is for a fixed term, but there is provision in the Bill to remove the chairman should that be necessary.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para0"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the other amendments in the group as we have quite a lot of ground to cover. Amendments Nos. 138, 139 and 141, and 159 to 161 <P>


<a name="column_1198"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would require SEPA to hold its meetings in public, and to make any minutes of such meetings and any of its records available for inspection free of charge, and to make copies obtainable on payment of local photocopying rates. Amendment No. 173 would place a duty on SEPA to be transparent in meeting its statutory requirements in relation to public access to information.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para1"></a>I sympathise with the underlying aim of the amendments: to make SEPA's decision-making process more transparent in order to gain the confidence of the public. Nevertheless, Amendment No. 138 would prevent SEPA from holding any meetings in private to discuss matters in confidence; for example, where important commercial issues are at stake. Because of such considerations I believe it is right that the agency itself should be free to determine whether its meetings should be in public.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para2"></a>In addition to the statutory public registers which SEPA will be obliged to maintain, information held by it including minutes of its meetings will be available to the public through the Environmental Information Regulations 1992. Those regulations were in response to the European directive to which the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, referred. Some of the amendments would, however, circumvent the important exclusions in the regulations to safeguard commercially confidential information&#151;information which either is or might be used in legal proceedings and information which might in some way threaten our national security.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para3"></a>One immediate and tangible benefit of the establishment of SEPA will be in relation to the greater ease of access to its public registers. For the first time, those registers will be available for inspection at single points of contact, greatly improving the existing arrangements where the registers are dispersed across a number of authorities.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para4"></a>Since SEPA will obviously be obliged to meet all of its statutory requirements, Amendment No. 173 is not therefore required in this respect. Ensuring that it does so in a transparent way, and without undue inconvenience, is a matter, I suggest, for the agency's management statement. A section on public access to information is already contained in the draft published in October last year. I believe that there is already good access for the public under those regulations and I cannot therefore accept the need for the amendments.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 141 and 159 to 161 would also require copies of minutes and records to be available at "local photocopying rates" in preference to "reasonable" rates as prescribed in the 1992 Environmental Information Regulations.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para6"></a>I recognise the concern that can arise about the interpretation which may be placed on the "reasonableness" of photocopying charges. The establishment of a single, national agency should assist in this respect. I also believe that it is right in principle that SEPA should be able to set reasonable charges which recover the costs it incurs in providing copies of documents. But I agree that it should not seek to debar access through inflated charges.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para7"></a>The Government are keen to ensure maximum openness in the affairs of SEPA, without compromising its ability to discharge its functions effectively. The <P>


<a name="column_1199"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions of the Environmental Information Regulations will apply to the agency, and I believe that this will ensure good public access. I also remind noble Lords that SEPA is not obliged to charge. If it so wishes, it can provide information and facilities for inspection free of charge. I therefore invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   In many ways what the noble Earl says is welcome. However, does he agree that Amendment No. 173 should be accepted by the Government because it states in so many words, exactly what the noble Earl said?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I stated that under the provisions in the Bill SEPA will have to provide the transparency and ease of access for which the amendment calls. Therefore, the amendment, although not unwelcome, is unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel said that we have achieved something from this group of amendments. With regard to public meetings, I appreciate the necessity for certain commercial confidentiality; even in local authorities that must arise. One cannot avoid some confidential meetings. However, the amendment provides that it should be clear to people where the meetings are held and who will attend; and a general idea of what is minuted should be available.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para8"></a>On publication and duplication at commercial rates, a large number of small businesses in the high street, having bought the equipment do well by charging for duplicating. I do not understand why a body such as SEPA could not do the same as it does not seem to be terribly complicated.
<P>

<a name="50126-07_para9"></a>I am glad that the register will be available and I hope that it will also be intelligible. Some reports are written in such a way that it takes diligence such as is applied by the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, when in the Library. He is one of the few people I know who can apply such diligence when required. The public in general are not always as hardworking and diligent as the noble Earl. I should like some reassurance that the report will be intelligible to the average person.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-07_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   With SEPA not even in existence at this stage, all I can say is that the information asked for will be provided.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-08_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I hesitate to weary the Committee, which has been discussing Scottish affairs, with matters which relate substantially to England and Wales. However, it so happens that this is the appropriate place in the Bill for the schedule I propose. For reasons of time, which I know the noble Viscount will understand, I did not move the paving amendment the other evening. I thought that it would be useful, however, to move the schedule so that we could discuss the whole matter of common land. I emphasise to the Committee that this is a probing amendment; it is not designed to be written verbatim into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para10"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware of the importance of common land. It is privately owned land over which others have rights in common with the landowner to graze stock, to collect wood and to cut turf, bracken and so on. Those rights probably pre-date the private ownership of land. Commons have remained largely undisturbed and unenclosed throughout a long period of history. I am told that there are some 1.3 million acres of common land in England and Wales, but, like everywhere else, that land is under threat.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para11"></a>The Government recognised the importance of common land as long ago as 1983 when they set up what was known then as the Common Land Forum. The forum was a body consisting of people who had interests in commons in all respects. Its aim was to agree proposals for legislation. The Government said that if the forum reached agreement, they would consider legislation.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para12"></a>In its 1986 report the forum did reach agreement on proposals for access to and management of&#151;two important points&#151;common land. It also agreed on tidying up registration. I recognise that the Government have had great difficulty in keeping the members of the forum together in&#151;if I may use a rugby analogy&#151;one single scrum. They seem to have gone off in different directions since the forum reported.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para13"></a>I do not think it right that the Government should do nothing. I therefore propose this schedule to the Bill which will deal with the most urgent threats facing our common land. First, although the Commons Registration Act 1965 required that all common land be registered by a certain date, I am afraid that much was not registered. Therefore, by virtue of the Act, it ceased to be common land. Furthermore, not even those commons which were registered are safe. Since the registers closed in 1972, there has been a steady exit of commons from the registers. The Open Space Society has compiled a list of 75 commons which it knows have been deregistered since then. However, there may be many more that the society has not been able to find.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para14"></a>There are a number of commons, even at present, which are subject to deregistration procedures. The amendment I propose prevents the deregistration of commons and ensures that those which remain are safe and secure on the registers.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para15"></a>I refer the Committee to paragraph 3 of my proposed schedule, "Disturbance of land". Despite the existing legislation, commons do not enjoy much legal protection. I should explain&#151;perhaps I ought to have said this at the outset&#151;that in Wales I live on the border of a common of some 770 acres. Thus, in that sense, I <P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have an interest. Perhaps I should also declare that I have a pecuniary interest in that I am allowed to graze 60 ewes on the commons adjoining my property. The fact that I have a grass-keep arrangement with the neighbouring farmer, which includes that, will, I hope, allow me to continue with what I have to say without being debarred through the fact that I have a pecuniary interest.
<P>

<a name="50126-08_para16"></a>Section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925 requires that the consent of the Secretary of State for the Environment&#151;that is the case in England&#151;or the Secretary of State for Wales must be obtained for fences, buildings or other works which prevent or impede access to commons. The section excludes disturbance of the soil by ploughing or other means which can be very damaging, not least to the bird life or the archaeology of our commons. My amendment brings such operations within the ambit of Section 194 of the Act. At present, that section applies only to land which was subject to common rights on 1st January 1926 when the Law of Property Act came into force. We are a long way from 1926 &#151;nearly 70 years&#151;and it is frequently impossible to know&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. This is a rather important point. I agree with what he says about the Law of Property Act, but the application of that Act has to a considerable extent been overtaken by the Commons Registration Act 1965. So we do not have to look quite so far back perhaps as the noble Lord thinks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord who is an expert in the matter. However, if he will kindly hear me out, perhaps I may answer his point. It is not easy to know whether the land in question was subject to rights at that point. This carries through to the 1965 Act and to today. Anyway, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, quite rightly points out, since we have common land registers, if all the common land were on the registers I would agree that that point is of a minor nature. But it is not.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para0"></a>The schedule that I propose is merely to clarify and simplify the matter. The schedule should apply to all commons on the Common Land Register and the agency should be the agency that keeps the register. That is the minimum that is necessary at the moment. I agree that this Bill may not be the right place and I would have liked the Government to produce legislation of their own. If that is impossible, we have to try to ensure that the minimum is achieved. It is for that reason that I put forward this schedule for discussion. We can have a debate, the Government can respond and, in responding, perhaps the noble Viscount can tell us why we have not had legislation to fulfil the Conservative manifesto of 1987. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has done a valuable service by moving this amendment containing a new schedule which is intended to fill in what he regards as gaps in our law relating to common land and the administration of it. Undoubtedly there have been gaps. I must disclose, in relation to a case that went to the High Court&#151;it is no longer there so it is not sub judice and I can therefore <P>


<a name="column_1204"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mention it&#151;that we were very anxious about the way in which we thought that lands were common lands at Huntingdon. Until the High Court made a new scheme it would seem that they were not common lands in the full sense; but they are now. It is very important indeed that we should get the whole of this law right with regard to common land.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para1"></a>I would have thought that the amendment should easily fit into the framework of this Bill. It is perhaps a bit of an adumbration when it comes to fitting it in to the protection of the environment as a whole, but it relates to a part of the environment, and a part that we need to protect. Therefore, I should have thought that it is relevant for us to consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para2"></a>I have to confess that I find the amendment of the noble Lord a very technical one. Although he was kind enough to imply that I know something about this branch of the law, I would not claim to understand all the detailed implications that arise from his amendment. My noble friend Lord Ullswater has no doubt taken advice on this and I shall be very interested to hear what he has to say.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para3"></a>Quite clearly, we do not want land which has been registered as common land to be easily removed from the register. But my experience has been that there has been difficulty in getting land which ought to be registered put on the register. That seems to me to be an even higher priority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lords Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I am sure that he will recall what I said: the register set up under the 1965 Act closed in 1972.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Yes, that is so&#151;and there were very considerable difficulties during the time that it was in operation.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para4"></a>To summarise, this is a matter which should be considered in relation to the Bill. This schedule, technical though it is, is something that we should consider and on which we should receive the advice of my noble friend Lord Ullswater. I do not commit myself, until I have heard my noble friend, to saying that I support the amendment. But I am in broad sympathy with its aims.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I should like to support my noble friend in this amendment. I am very glad indeed to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, because I think it has been a rather sad tale about our commons. There is no doubt that a lot were not registered which should have been registered and that a great many of those that have been registered have suffered, and are being reduced in number and indeed in the quality of what they offer. The tale goes back a long way. It was in 1958 that the Royal Commission on Common Land published its report and made a number of recommendations to safeguard common land and improve access to it. In fact, that did lead up to the passing of the Commons Registration Act 1965. Since then, successive governments have expressed sympathy with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but very little has happened. We do know of the losses that are happening.
<P>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para5"></a>The Government have not kept their word. We had a commitment to legislation in the 1987 manifesto, and repeated questions have been asked since then. My noble friend Lady Nicol, who is very sorry that she cannot be here tonight, has, I think you might say, pestered the Government over and over again with questions about when they are going to do something about common land. In April last year she asked a Question and was told by the noble Earl, Lord Arran:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I can confirm that it still does remain our policy to safeguard the status of common land and to strengthen the ways in which it is protected and used".&#151;[Official Report, 14/4/94; col. 1618.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para6"></a>Our contention is that they are not being satisfactorily protected and the Government really ought to be committed to do something. My noble friend's amendment goes some way towards adding some protection. I hope that it will be very seriously considered. I know that he said it is a probing amendment and I hope that we shall get a sympathetic response. The Government owes that to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para7"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Renton, was referring to Spring Common in Huntingdon when he was speaking, but I think he was. I understand that it is, in fact, still being damaged and, of course, we all regret that, so I shall hope for a favourable response from the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   The amendments made by this schedule to the law relating to common land and town or village greens seek to provide a partial answer to the problems arising from common land. They do not entirely attain even that objective, and in some respects would do more harm than good.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para8"></a>I realise that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, put them forward by way of probing amendments; but he did say that his amendments address the most urgent threats. I have to say to him that I believe that they fail to address the principal problems associated with common land&#151;those of removing from registers land which has been registered incorrectly and providing improved arrangements for the management of commons. I have to say, therefore, that this partial approach is not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para9"></a>There is a wide range of interests concerned with this subject, particularly those who earn their living from common land. I notice that the noble Lord indicated his close connection with commons. His experience obviously gives him a certain amount of expertise in the matter. Experience with the Common Land Forum, which reported in 1986, and the consequent discussions have shown just how difficult it is to balance the interests involved, and how difficult the process of changing the arrangements for registration and management of common land would be.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para10"></a>My noble friend Lord Strathclyde advised the House on 27th July 1993 that the Government could see no way in which comprehensive legislation on the basis of the Common Land Forum report could be taken forward. He indicated that the priority questions which the Government wish to address are those of registration and management. Since that time a lot of careful thought and informal consultations with a wide range of <P>


<a name="column_1206"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interested bodies have been applied to these questions. I hope to be able to report the result of those consultations in the near future. Therefore, I do not think that it would be right to think that the Government have been entirely sitting on their hands. There are difficult problems and the way forward has not been easy to find.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_time0"></a><H5>5 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Perhaps I may interrupt the noble Viscount. Is it not a fact that at one point there was a draft Bill in his department?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-09_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I am not aware of that but I shall find out and write to the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para11"></a>As a general comment, I understand the noble Lord's desire, in the context of the Bill, to involve the environment agency in matters relating to common land. But the environment agency is to be formed from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the National Rivers Authority. Although both organisations may operate on common land in the course of their current duties, they have no history of involvement with the subject nor expertise in the sometimes arcane legislation which governs common land.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para12"></a>Present arrangements place the responsibility for the registration of common land with the county councils and the London borough councils. That ensures that the registers are available for inspection in reasonably accessible locations for all who may wish to consult them. The records and the experienced staff of the registration authorities together are an invaluable resource at the core of that tier of local government.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para13"></a>At present, also, the power to apply to the county court in the case of any contravention of Section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925 rests with the county and district councils and with persons interested in the land in question. The amendments made by the proposed schedule would give the sole power to the environment agency. With the best will in the world, I cannot see the agency having the resources or the local knowledge to tackle unauthorised incursions onto common land, let alone to become involved in disputes concerning unauthorised fencing or other work. Nor can I understand the logic of preventing people interested in the common from applying to the court to restrain transgressors.
<P>

<a name="50126-09_para14"></a>In fact, I find it rather unusual to hear from the Benches opposite the suggestion that power be taken away from the commoners and the local authorities. The usual stance of the party opposite is to make certain that local authorities retain power. Giving it to the environment agency would remove the power from both the commoners and the local authority.

<A NAME="50126-10_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I bear in mind that perhaps we trespass into Scottish time. I could go through the schedule in some detail and point out inadequacies in the drafting. I see that the noble Lord shakes his head. Perhaps we need to address the matter on another occasion.

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para0"></a>In conclusion, the Government continue to believe that the problems associated with common land need a more considered and structured approach than this amendment would provide. I hope I have said enough to show why we cannot accept it. Therefore, perhaps the noble Lord will be persuaded to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Williams, replies, perhaps I may say that I fully understand the reply given by my noble friend Lord Ullswater. I was particularly interested when he said that he hoped to make a statement before long on the result of further thoughts in the department about the protection of common land. When he makes such a statement, will it be while the Bill is going through Parliament so that any consequential amendments in the present law that might be considered necessary could be made in this Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I quite understand that that would obviously be of some interest. But the report that I would make as a result of the consultations would not be at such an advanced stage as to allow for the statutory requirements or amendments to be made to this legislation while it is before noble Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and to my noble friend Lady David. I am also grateful to the Minister for responding to my amendment. I accept every criticism about its drafting. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, will be aware that I am not a conspicuously good drafter of amendments. The amendment may be rather technical. It comes from a hand which, I am bound to say, is not mine.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para1"></a>Nevertheless, the amendment tries to address what we consider to be the initial and major problems relating to common land. The Minister says that the amendment does not address the major problem relating to common land. I should like to have moved an amendment which addressed the whole problem of registration and the management of common land. If I may speak from my own experience, and, indeed, as the noble Viscount knows, it is the management of common land which is a major problem. In fact, the common land which abuts my property in Wales is simply not managed at all by anybody.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para2"></a>I should like to have introduced such an amendment. But, as the Committee knows, my aims in all things are modest. I do not try to persuade the Committee that I want to solve all the problems at once. In moving the schedule, I simply wanted to put the item on the agenda. It is now very firmly on the agenda.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para3"></a>The Minister replied to the amendment and clarified his reply to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, saying that he would make an announcement "shortly" or "before long". We are rather cynical about ministerial announcements which are to be made as soon as possible, shortly or before long. So I wish to press the noble Viscount further. I said that the amendment was a probing amendment. If I do not receive a suitable reply&#151;not at this stage of the Bill but at some future stage&#151;it could easily become an amendment which stops being probing and on which I would seek the opinion of the Chamber. But since we are in Committee, we are entitled to a discussion and to have an assurance <P>


<a name="column_1208"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from the Minister that the Government at least recognise the problem and recognise, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, that this Bill is the proper place for the matter to be addressed. I understand that the Minister may say that it cannot be done while the Bill is before this Chamber, but before the Bill leaves Parliament there should be some announcement from the Government about their intentions on common land.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para4"></a>As my noble friend Lady David pointed out, the problem has been around for a long time. The Government have a long-standing commitment. It is simply not good enough to say that they are still studying the problem and still consulting on it. We have heard that since their manifesto commitment of 1987. The ball is very firmly in the Government's court. I hope that the noble Viscount will honour us with an assurance that, before the Bill leaves Parliament as an Act, we shall have some announcement of the Government's future intentions for common land and the prospect of legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I have to say no, I do not believe that this Bill is the proper place for that. It is not the proper legislation in which to include this point on common land. The use of the environment agency as a peg on which to hang this little piece of legislation is not appropriate. I indicated that informal consultations have been going on with a wide range of interested bodies. In order to report on the result of those consultations, there is need for further consideration. In this instance I sought not entirely to destroy the amendment the noble Lord proposes but I do not feel that this is the right place to introduce such legislation. I feel that it needs further thought and further consultation. It will not be ready before this Bill passes through Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Perhaps I may add one point. The Bill deals with national parks. Common land and national parks are both of public concern and they are both precious parts of the environment. This is an Environment Bill. Whether or not we require the environment agency, which has quite different powers, to consider the matter, I should have thought that what we are doing for national parks would not be very different from what we might wish to do for common land.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   What we are doing with national parks is setting up some authorities to deal with the management of national parks. That is a transfer of some local authority functions to the national park authorities. We shall be discussing that in some detail next week. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, indicated that he wanted the environment agency to have some function in common land. However, I do not believe that it is the right place to involve the environment agency in this rather specialised form of legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I find the Government's response to all that the Committee has said extremely disappointing. As my noble friend Lady David said, we have been walking around this problem now for years and years and years. The Government had a commitment in the Conservative manifesto of 1987 to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>bring forward legislation on the basis of the common land forum. Even today, in 1995, the Minister can get up and say, "We are still considering the problem and we are still consulting with interested parties. We will make an announcement some time after this Bill receives Royal Assent". We are not satisfied with that. At a later stage of the Bill, regardless of what the noble Viscount says about whether or not this is the right place, there will be further amendments on this issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50126-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove </B>   moved Amendment No. 152:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 After Clause 23, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Production of environmental quality plans</B></center><br>
. SEPA shall coordinate the production of environmental quality plans with the aim of integrating the activities of environmental regulatory authorities in Scotland and to provide a framework for guiding decisions on the management and protection of the environment.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-10_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: On behalf of my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford, I wish to move Amendment No. 152 and speak also to Amendments Nos. 182 to 184, 184A, 185, 185A, 185B and 185C. The purpose of Amendment No. 152 is to enable SEPA to fulfil the Government's intention to secure the opportunity for more integrated environmental protection. It is concerned with quality plans. Threats to the environment do not arise solely from pollution and Scotland's environment cannot be protected by an agency concerned only with the pollution control end of the cycle. The environment is complex and interrelated and requires to be looked at in an integrated way.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para10"></a>This amendment would enable SEPA to draw up environmental quality plans which build on the experience of the National Rivers Authority which produces water catchment management plans in England and Wales. Such plans would enable the integration of the various functions of Scotland's agencies as they relate to water catchments. Integrated planning of activities within catchments would enable SEPA to play an active part in tackling problems where a number of bodies may be acting at cross-purposes. It would enable SEPA to take account of and influence activities which may have a cumulative impact on the environment but which are currently planned or managed under separate and unconnected systems. For example, a catchment plan could address the cumulative effects of agricultural run-off, forestry practice, sewage inputs and other activities on a water body and would be an economic way of avoiding problems which are very costly to remedy.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para11"></a>The estuary of the River Ythan in Grampian is badly affected by nitrate enrichment, mostly from agricultural activities, which has been exacerbated by the removal of buffer strips along water courses. The nutrient enrichment causes algal mats on the surface of the mudflats which prevent birds, such as dunlins, from <P>


<a name="column_1210"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>feeding on invertebrates. An action plan based on catchment management is now seen as the only solution and is being developed by a consortium of agencies. This amendment would enable SEPA to take this approach as a matter of course before costly problems reach that stage.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para12"></a>The other amendments are supportive of Amendment No. 152. Amendment No. 183 brings the Bill into line with current thinking on protection of the water environment. "Cleanliness" of the water, while important, takes an extremely limited view of the water environment, ignoring the biological quality, hydrological quality and geomorphological quality. All these factors should be within SEPA's duties with respect to water.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para13"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to make another little concession on what to me is a commonsense and helpful group of amendments. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-10_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I do not doubt the common sense of the amendment and especially the sentiment behind it. SEPA's relationship to the water environment is crucial to its functions and duties.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para14"></a>Amendment No. 152 would require SEPA to take the lead in the preparation of environmental quality plans, as the noble Lord described, to integrate the work of environmental regulatory authorities in Scotland and to seek to apply a common framework for the consideration of matters by these authorities. The noble Lord explained that the intention behind Amendment No. 152 is to require SEPA to adopt the catchment based management approach used by the NRA. The Government do not believe that approach is necessary in Scotland. Scotland's geography is very different from that south of the Border. Its rivers are relatively short and fast flowing with nothing comparable to the long and meandering rivers such as the Thames, the Severn, the Ouse and Bristol Avon. In addition, 95 per cent. of Scotland's public water supplies come from upland sources whereas that is true for only one-third of water supplies in England. The other two-thirds in England come from abstraction lower down the river or from groundwater sources.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para15"></a>These factors, combined with Scotland's relatively lower density of population and comparative lack of heavy industry, mean that the scale of potential pollution is less. As Scotland's river flow is greater, the result is that the effects of any pollution incidents are mitigated. Against this background there is less of a need for comprehensive controls of the kind which have been adopted in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para16"></a>That being said, the Government have acknowledged that existing arrangements can be improved. It is precisely because current regulatory arrangements are so fragmented that SEPA is to be set up to bring together responsibility for the key forms of pollution to air, water and land. In addition, we envisage SEPA agreeing memoranda of understanding with other public bodies which impinge upon its work. One such public body would be the HSE. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, mentioned a specific location in Scotland, the river Ythan estuary. It is where there are specific areas <P>


<a name="column_1211"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requiring environmental management that the work of SEPA will need to be co-ordinated with the work of other authorities that the memorandum of understanding and the bilateral obligations on both parties will be established.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para17"></a>I am satisfied that SEPA has the power to draw up joint plans, if necessary; but it would be wrong to give it the main co-ordinating role in every circumstance. For example, Scottish National Heritage might have a major interest in an issue. It would not be right therefore for SEPA to be in the lead. On reflection, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that these are not aspects on which the precision of legislation is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para18"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 182 is to remove the possibility of ministerial directions in connection with SEPA's duties with respect to the cleanliness of waters and the conservation of water resources. There is no hidden agenda here. The Government have no anxieties in relation to the river purification authorities meeting their existing duties. Clause 32(1) strengthens the current duties by widening the scope of the waters to be protected specifically to include groundwater. We should however bear in mind that these duties will in future apply to a body with a very different nature from river purification authorities. SEPA will be an integrated body whose functions encompass the prevention and control of pollution to air, water and land.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para19"></a>We accept the need for SEPA to have specific duties in relation to the water environment over and above its general environmental duties reflecting the existing RPA's wider scope in relation to pollution of controlled waters. However, we do not want these duties to skew unreasonably the work of the agency. This amendment would remove the safety net which we have built in to ensure this does not happen.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para20"></a>I should now like to turn to Amendments Nos. 183 to 185C. I have some sympathy with the general direction of these amendments, but I do not see their adoption for SEPA as appropriate. Other bodies will also have their part to play in achieving these objectives. Our aim is broadly to transfer the existing duties of the river purification authorities for water protection to SEPA with some strengthening in relation to groundwater.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para21"></a>Amendment No. 183 appears to reflect the European Commission's proposals for a new ecological quality of water directive. It would be inappropriate to define SEPA's role in these terms, particularly at this early stage in the preparation of a new directive, when it is far from clear what its eventual shape will be. SEPA is, for instance, unlikely to be the only statutory body contributing to the work of achieving high ecological quality in terms of the directive, should it be adopted. Other organisations such as Scottish Natural Heritage are likely to have a part to play. We should wait until the directive is adopted to define such roles.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para22"></a>Amendment No. 184 effectively removes any reference to practicability in relation to SEPA's role in conserving water resources, and places an onus on SEPA to determine what uses of water are proper. This is too wide a task for SEPA.
<P>


<a name="column_1212"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para23"></a>Amendment No. 184A similarly removes the reference to "practicable", and would place duties on the agency which it could not meet, given the powers available to it.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para24"></a>Amendment No. 185 gives a promotional role to SEPA which again goes well beyond its powers and duties as an environmental regulator. It seems to me that such a role more appropriately lies with the new water authorities. The same also applies to Amendments Nos. 185A, 185B and 185C. Those impose an absolute duty in relation to the conservation of the water environment that would deflect SEPA from its primary role as a pollution prevention and control body.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para25"></a>The noble Lord may be aware of Section 65 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which will place a new duty on the Secretary of State and the new water authorities to promote the conservation and effective use of the water resources of, and the provision of adequate water supplies throughout, Scotland. I would suggest that this existing legislative provision is sufficient to meet his concerns.
<P>

<a name="50126-10_para26"></a>This is an important area and water is an important factor within Scotland. I trust that I have been able to reassure the Committee that the existing water duties on the new agency and on other bodies are sufficient. On that basis, I ask noble Lords to consider withdrawing their amendments.

<A NAME="50126-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   The Minister has put a very convincing case. I certainly see the relationship between Scottish and English rivers as being quite different: there is no comparison. However, I do not believe that we should take the matter too easily in that we do not need a greater ability to co-ordinate. The Minister gave the impression that there was more information to be brought out fairly soon about the powers of SEPA to carry out more co-ordination than exists at present. I believe the noble Earl said that a memorandum of understanding will be brought out to clarify some of the points which are put forward in these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   It may be useful if I add that the memorandum of understanding was set out in the draft management statement in October 1994. I suggest that I write to the noble Lord and include a copy of that draft management statement concerning the memorandum of understanding. The noble Lord will then know exactly what details have been established.

<P>

<A NAME="50126-11_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour </B>   moved Amendment No. 152ZA:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 23, line 30, after ("works") insert (", other than scouring or repairing any existing drain, watercourse or outfall, or carrying out any drainage works for the purpose of improving drainage for agriculture of any land which has at any time been cultivated,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-11_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, and to the Scottish Landowners' Federation for assisting me with this amendment. From <P>


<a name="column_1213"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a practical point of view, much of the drainage of the best agricultural land in Scotland was put down during the 18th century. Some of it involved amazing feats of engineering. The trouble is that after this length of time in some of the beautiful drainage schemes which were put in with horseshoe tiles, the tiles have collapsed.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para3"></a>The object of this amendment is to allow landowners in normal repair and maintenance, particularly as regards agricultural land, to be able to carry out the necessary repairs without it being necessary to get approval from SEPA or anybody else. In many ways there is a wonderful advance in knowledge today, which simply did not exist a few years ago, of how drains can be cleaned out by scouring them.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para4"></a>Literally, since I entered the Chamber I have received a letter from my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie in which he states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The intention behind Clause 24 is to place on a statutory footing the consultation which is currently required as a condition of the payment of grant for drainage works from the Forestry Commission and the Scottish Office, and to extend the consultation requirement to other significant drainage works".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para5"></a>I am not aware of any Forestry Commission grants. There were some grants for drainage to agricultural land. The letter continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We [the Government] therefore envisage that the Regulations will prescribe those minor drainage works ... rather than in the Bill".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para6"></a>In drafting the amendment, it was partly to try to reduce the need for SEPA having to deal with every sort of minor repair. To a great extent, the ordinary landowner on an average estate today is very conscious of the effects of pollution and is only too keen to preserve his own interests without again having to go to yet another authority in order to carry out his responsible repairs and maintenance. This amendment is grouped with other amendments to which other noble Lords will no doubt wish to speak; but, for the moment, I beg to move.

I have been briefed by the Scottish Landowners' Federation which generally welcomes the concept of SEPA. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of Clause 24(1) appear extremely restrictive and could include everything from cleaning a minor field drain upwards. The amendment seeks to allow normal farm drain maintenance. Clause 24(2) states:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Earl is agreeable to the grouping that was put forward&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Yes, but I thought that the noble Lord might want to speak to his own amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   The noble Earl's amendment, Amendment No. 152ZA, precedes the amendments that have been grouped. I refer to <P>


<a name="column_1214"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendments Nos. 152A, 152B, 153, 154, 154A and 154B. I should like to refer particularly to Amendments Nos. 153, 154 and 154B.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para8"></a>I appreciate the efforts that the noble Earl has made; but I have a slight concern about his amendment. In general, the clause has to be welcomed, but it unfortunately takes a limited view of the environmental impact of drainage work. It requires only "consultation" on the precautions that should be taken to prevent pollution. It fails to encompass drainage works which could have highly damaging effects on the environment. There is great anxiety over the piecemeal, site-based approach to land drainage and flood defence in Scotland. Excessive land drainage has resulted in a loss of valuable wetland habitat and buffer strips along water courses which can filter pollutants and sediment. Despite that impact, there is no government body to maintain an overview of the potential environmental impact, be it local or catchment-wide, of such works.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para9"></a>The principal object of land drainage is to carry water away from the land as fast as possible. That process gives rise to many problems, including an increased tendency for rivers to flood in wet weather and a loss of wetlands in dry weather, both of which give rise to secondary problems. Improvements in technology since the 1950s have made it possible to drain almost all lowland farmland so that very little grassland is left. Drainage has also been extended to the uplands. In Tayside, for example, up to 8 per cent. of the land area was hill-drained in the 1970s, increasing the erosive potential of run-off and contributing to losses of soil and nutrients. Not only do the silt and nutrients cause problems for rivers, but farmers have no wish to lose them from the land in the first place. The consequent effect of all the drainage has been a serious decline in the wide variety of wildlife that is dependent on those wetlands.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para10"></a>Amendment No. 154 strengthens what I have described as a "consultation procedure". It requires those carrying out drainage works to "have regard to" rather than simply "take account of" the views of SEPA. That is a fairly important difference which the Minister may find it worth endorsing. That change emphasises the importance of consultation and highlights the significant weight that should be accorded to SEPA's opinion on drainage operations.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para11"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 154B, the clause allows the Secretary of State to prescribe types of drainage works for which consultation shall not be required. That causes us some anxiety because it provides no rationale or clarification as to why, or what, drainage works may be excluded. Again, the Minister should be able to clear up that point fairly quickly. It would be more appropriate for SEPA to determine in the pursuit of its functions the extent and degree to which consultation is necessary for various types of drainage work. Why is it desirable to allow some drainage works to be excluded from the consultation process, and on what basis is that being done? I am sure that there is some rationale to it, but there may be a quicker way of achieving that end. <P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Is it possible to specify the categories that could be excluded? I commend my amendments to the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   I have great sympathy with the amendments which stand in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove; and, with the possible exception of Amendment No. 154B, I would support them.
<P>

<a name="50126-11_para12"></a>Amendment No. 154B, and Amendment No. 152ZA (which stands in the names of the noble Earls), provide an important derogation from the main provisions. It is worthwhile having something like that. On the point of whether the derogation is too widely cast and the exceptions too wide, I shall wait to hear what the Government have to say before making up my mind. On the whole, I think that we should be strengthening anti-pollution methods in this area. As I have said, the majority of this group of amendments are worthwhile, and I hope that the Government will accept them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I imagine that my noble friend will say that the power in subsection (2) will be used to make any exemption which is necessary, such as that referred to in Amendment No. 152ZA which stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Balfour. On the other side of the coin, however, I hope that my noble friend will take on board a point which I am not quite sure that I understood from the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, although it may have been there. One function of undrained land is to act as a buffer between a rainstorm and a river system. It takes the water in quickly and lets it out slowly. If you drain that land, it takes water in quickly and lets it out quickly. The result is a much greater strain on the river system which has to dispose of it. That may result in floods. Therefore, I see why the noble Lord seeks to establish the way in which there shall be some communication between those who intend to increase the load on the river system and those who are responsible for the river system.

<A NAME="50126-12_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am glad that we have been able to get 18th century horseshoe tiles into the debate. Much of the debate has been about the less attractive forms of pollution, so it is good to cast our minds back in that way.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para0"></a>The first amendments in the group relate to SEPA's function in relation to drainage works. Amendment No. 152ZA, which has been tabled by my noble friend Lord Balfour and the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, seeks to prescribe on the face of the Bill types of drainage works for which consultation with SEPA is not required. Conversely, Amendment No. 154B would remove the Secretary of State's power to make regulations exempting those proposing to carry out specified types of drainage works from the consultation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para1"></a>I do not believe that all drainage works are significant enough to warrant the imposition of these new arrangements. I therefore have great sympathy with the intention behind Amendment No. 152ZA. I am, however, afraid that the imprecise nature of the terms used in the amendment would jeopardise the successful implementation of the consultation arrangements.
<P>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para2"></a>The Government's intention behind Clause 24 is to place on a statutory footing the consultation which is currently required as a condition of the payment of grant for drainage works from the Forestry Commission and the Scottish Office, and to extend the consultation requirement to other significant drainage works. I say to my noble friend Lord Balfour that Forestry Commission grants cover planting, and therefore specific conditions relating to drainage and other relevant matters are linked to the grants made.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, and my noble friend Lord Elton are all seeking some pattern and rationale behind the exemptions that are likely to be made. "Why, and on what basis?", was asked. We envisage that the regulations will prescribe those minor drainage works where the risk of pollution is so low as to make the need to consult unwarranted, such as tile drains, and repairs to existing drains. In view of the need to prescribe clearly the types of works to be exempted, it seems appropriate for the Government to include the detailed provisions required in regulations rather than in the Bill itself. I can tell the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, that draft regulations will be brought forward in good time for consultation before the obligations in Clause 24 come into force. I can however assure the Committee that the Secretary of State will consult widely among interested groups over the detail of such regulations and exemptions.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 152A and 152B seek to change the locus of SEPA's interest away from the preventing of pollution to controlled waters to the effect of such works and the prevention of any environmental damage. The amendments would unduly broaden the agency's interest beyond that of its functions, and could result in it becoming embroiled in matters such as land use planning.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para5"></a>I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, that the definition of "controlled waters", which seems to be the concern behind Amendment No. 153, is wide enough to cover the entire aquatic environment that might be affected by drainage works. I hope that gives him some comfort.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para6"></a>The term "pollution" can be seen very much in the context of harm and is a well understood term in legislation. Relying additionally on the term "damage", however, as suggested in these amendments might cause problems, given that it might be interpreted in too wide a sense. For example, any works which might affect a river course, for instance by widening it, could be argued to be damaging it in the sense that it is being altered.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para7"></a>There is no material difference between the provisions in Clause 24, "to take account" of SEPA views, and the amendment requiring "due regard". The amendment would not strengthen the amount of attention or weight to be applied to the agency's comments. There is therefore no reason for changing the existing provision.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para8"></a>Amendment No. 154A would however require SEPA "recommendations" to be followed. I do not believe that individuals should be compelled to accept, lock, stock and barrel, the views of SEPA, in respect of drainage, no matter how authoritative. It is for those carrying out such works to accept the final responsibility for their actions. If they were merely "following recommendations", that responsibility would pass inevitably to SEPA.

<P>

<a name="50126-12_para9"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 215 contains proposals for forestry works to take account of their effect on the environment, including the aquatic environment. The Forestry Commission already approves proposals only if they follow the forests and water guidelines. Those guidelines have been drawn up in consultation with water and fisheries interests, including the Scottish river purification authorities. In addition, the Forestry Commission has been directed by Ministers to consult statutory bodies before approving forestry proposals.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para10"></a>I am quite sure that those arrangements are sufficient to ensure that the river purification authority's views are taken into account before it approves any significant proposals. The river purification authorities' responsibilities would be assumed by SEPA and the commission's consultation arrangements would therefore be extended directly to the new agency.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para11"></a>I do not believe that there is a need for an inflexible statutory duty. The arrangements for taking account of the effects of forestry proposals on water have worked well and the Government will wish them to continue after the new agency has been set up.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para12"></a>I trust that I have been able to reassure the Committee that the land drainage arrangements provide the necessary safeguards against pollution. On that basis I would ask my noble friend to consider withdrawing the amendment.

<A NAME="50126-12_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   In view of the serious anxieties of landowners about the provisions of Clause 24, it would be a tremendous help if my noble friend would be kind enough to ask the Secretary of State, under Clause 24(2), to produce draft regulations as to how it will affect landowners and foresters. We should be in a much better position to know how much we shall be affected. There are some amazing cundies in stone varying from four inches square to those which are large enough for us to walk down easily, and which were built years and years ago. The problem is that when they give trouble, they give real trouble. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 After Clause 24, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Abstraction of water: control order</B></center><br>
.&#151;(1) The Secretary of State may make an order (referred to in this Part of this Act as a "control order") for the purpose of controlling, restricting or prohibiting any abstraction of water.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State may make a control order only on the application of SEPA, acting in pursuance of their duties under this Act.
<br>
(3) A control order shall apply to all inland waters or ground waters within an area specified in the order (referred to in this Part of the Act as a "control area").
<br>
(4) The power to make a control order shall be exercisable by statutory instrument.
<br>
(5) A person who abstracts water in an area to which a control order applies, or causes or permits any other person to abstract such water shall, subject to subsection (6) below, be guilty of an offence under this section.
<br>
(6) A person shall not be guilty of an offence under subsection (5) above if he abstracts such water under and in accordance with a valid licence under this Part of this Act.
<br>
(7) SEPA may grant a licence for the abstraction of water in an area to which a control order applies in favour of and on application by a person who is, or will be when the licence comes into force, the occupier of the land within a control area.
<br>
(8) Licences as granted in subsection (7) above shall be set in pursuance of SEPA's duties under section 7 of this Act.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-12_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be for the convenience of the Committee to take also Amendments Nos. 156, 157, 158 and 158B. The purpose of Amendment No. 158B is to accord comprehensive abstraction control to SEPA. Water abstraction has a significant effect upon the cleanliness of rivers, inland tidal waters and the conservation of water resources. That matter is dealt with more fully in Clause 32.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para17"></a>For example, water abstraction affects directly the dilution ability of the water. If the river flow is allowed to get too low, it is unable to dilute sewage effluent and therefore the river purification board cannot guarantee water quality. Abstraction can also have a damaging effect upon the aquatic environment, at times leaving rivers dry and lifeless. The shoreline can be reduced to bare mineral substrates without vegetation.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para18"></a>RPBs licensing powers are limited currently to the promotion of irrigation control orders under the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act which we dealt with in this place a few years ago. That control order mechanism is wholly unsatisfactory and inadequate. First, it is reactive in nature. Abstraction cannot be controlled until the damage has been caused. Furthermore, the Scottish Office has made it clear that designation of extensive control areas in anticipation of problems will not be allowed.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para19"></a>Secondly, it is time consuming. Experience has shown that it can take two years or longer to obtain a control order. Perhaps the Minister will be as surprised as I was to learn about that. Thirdly, it is limited to irrigation. SEPA must be able to control all types of abstraction. Due to those factors, and despite indications that the problem is far more widespread, only one control area has been established in Scotland. It is easy to foresee that a financially constrained SEPA will not allocate resources to this labour-intensive and unrewarding process unless it is forced to do so in a crisis.
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para20"></a>Previously, the Scottish Office argued that Scotland has sufficient water and therefore does not require overall abstraction controls. It is true that Scotland has a lot of water but there are periods of considerable difficulty, in particular in the south west. However, the Government have concluded that selective abstraction <P>


<a name="column_1219"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>controls should be produced following discussions with the EC on groundwater protection. Obviously, that will take several years, leaving SEPA without the powers necessary to perform its duties under Clause 33. Will the Minister say why SEPA has not been given the abstraction controls necessary for the proper performance of its duty?
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para21"></a>Subsection (1) of the proposed new clause, set out in Amendment No. 155, provides:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may make an order (referred to in this Part of this Act as a 'control order') for the purpose of controlling, restricting or prohibiting any abstraction of water".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para22"></a>The notes that I have been given on the new clauses are rather long-winded and I am sure that the Minister has already seen copies. Therefore, I shall briefly outline the intention of the new clauses. Subsection (2) provides that:

<P>

<a name="50126-12_para28"></a>Finally, subsection (8) provides that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Licences as granted in subsection (7) above shall be set in pursuance of SEPA's duties under section 7 of this Act".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-12_para29"></a>That gives SEPA the power to license the abstraction of water in areas which have been identified as control areas. Is that not a way around the problem of the authority having too much power? Perhaps a fair amount of trouble would be saved if there were control areas over which it had discretion. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I refer the Committee to subsection (8) of Amendment No. 155. The last line refers to "section 7". However, it should be "section 30" because Section 7 is an English provision and Section 30 is the Scottish equivalent. For that reason, the proposed new clause is slightly defective.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, referred to "underground strata" in Amendment No. 157. I am anxious about my personal position because the 42 households on the estate&#151;by no means all of which belong to me&#151;draw water from a spring maintained by the estate. We have never paid water rates and I should object most strongly to being charged for water, which <P>


<a name="column_1220"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is purely for household and farm purposes, when for many years it has been privately maintained and so forth. That is by no means an exception.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para1"></a>Furthermore, many of the distilleries in the Highlands have abstracted water from springs entirely maintained by them. In some cases, they have been used for more than 100 years and it would be unfair for them now to pay a fee to obtain a licence for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para2"></a>Amendment No. 158B refers to water abstraction licences and I wish to add the abstraction of water from rivers. If too much water is taken out and the river is not clean and contains raw sewage, the suspended solids and the raw sewage extract the air from the water and cause the fish to suffocate. Raw sewage does not do much harm to animals and humans but it can be extremely detrimental to fish. Where people are abstracting vast quantities of water for, say, irrigation, perhaps licences should be applied for and paid for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Balfour for his sharp eyes. I shall pass on the correction that he suggests to those who are best placed to make it.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, made his points well, as he did those proposed by his noble friend Lord Ewing. I hope that his noble friend is grateful for his tireless efforts. He will be glad to note that many of their anxieties relating to water abstraction are shared by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 155 to 158 enable SEPA to license abstractions in certain areas and adopt, in broad terms, the kind of selective approach that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in another place in November. Unfortunately, the amendments are incomplete and include other features that I must resist.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para5"></a>First, I cannot regard it as acceptable to apply the licensing regime retrospectively to statutory permissions already granted by the Secretary of State under other legislation for the use of water for hydro-electric generation or water supply purposes. It would be wrong to take away statutory rights already legally obtained by abstractors.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para6"></a>Secondly, the powers for charging, set out in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, are designed to defray the costs of works undertaken to ensure the better use of water. The construction of such works is not a matter for SEPA, which will not have powers for this purpose. On the other hand, the proposed charging powers would not enable SEPA to recover the costs of administering a licensing scheme, a feature which the Government would regard as essential.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para7"></a>An ability to review any licence at intervals of not less than two years would be inappropriate. In many cases, abstractors will need&#151;and will be entitled to&#151;the assurance that a licence will enable them to use water on a long-term basis. Those are, however, matters which can be resolved.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para8"></a>On the general point, we are at one on the principle of selective abstraction controls contained in the noble Lord's proposals. As the Secretary of State announced in November, the Government will bring forward their <P>


<a name="column_1221"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own legislation to introduce such a scheme in the light of the European Commission's action programme on groundwater, on which proposals are due by mid-1995.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para9"></a>Because of the timing of those, it is not practical to include provisions in this Bill. I also envisage further public consultation on the proposed charging arrangements before any scheme is introduced. I believe that that answers one of the specific questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, as to why SEPA is not being given the power proposed by his amendments.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para10"></a>Broadly similar considerations apply to Amendment No. 158B tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. However, that amendment seeks to introduce a comprehensive system of controls with SEPA having powers to exempt abstractions below a threshold which it would set.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para11"></a>The pressures on the Scottish water environment do not justify a comprehensive system of control even if, in specific locations&#151;and the noble Lord mentioned one in the south west of Scotland&#151;at specific times there are temporary pressures. Where there are potential problems, those can be dealt with through a selective approach. That approach is flexible enough to enable preventive action to be taken. The problem does not need to have first occurred. I cannot accept also that it is proper for SEPA to set exemptions. That is a matter which should be prescribed in regulations, which would enable there to be Parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para12"></a>In view of the fact that the Government will introduce their own legislation in relation to water abstraction controls in Scotland, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   We shall need to look at the proposed legislation but, in view of that, it would be wrong for me to pursue this matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="50126-13_para17"></a>We feel that without proper consultation compulsory purchase powers sometimes may be abused. I heard a tragic story of a water or sewerage authority acquiring <P>


<a name="column_1222"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a piece of very good agricultural land&#151;something like 20 acres out of 100&#151;on which to build a sewerage works. Those works were never built. The land was offered back to the original owner at a grossly inflated price because it was discovered that there was gravel underneath. The original owner could not afford to buy back the land. The authority abstracted a great deal of gravel, making a lovely profit. It then offered the land back to the original owner, by which time, he had lost what might have been his mineral rights. I believe that we need to be very careful in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para18"></a>I am very grateful to the Scottish Landowners' Federation for its help in drafting the amendment. That organisation is in favour of the Bill but it feels that the landowner must be protected, wherever possible, from an abuse of compulsory purchase powers. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Kintore: </B>   Clause 25(1) reads rather like mid-20th century confiscatory legislation rather than rapidly approaching 21st century legislation. The Minister may tell me that I am talking rot but I feel that landowners today are far more co-operative towards public bodies. I accept that SEPA must have compulsory purchase powers but I hope that those powers will be used only as a very last resort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I hesitate to intervene on what is a technical matter but I sympathise with the position which my noble friend Lord Balfour has put before the Committee. I wonder whether the same purpose would be achieved more simply if the requirement for which the land was to be bought were to be stated in the order made for its purchase and thus became a covenant on the purchaser. I put that forward as an alternative because I know that the Government like to consider all options in relation to matters that they have not thought of doing themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am afraid that I do not know enough about land law to comment on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-13_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful on behalf of the Government for those helpful suggestions, especially from my noble friends, Lord Elton and Lord Balfour and the noble Earl, Lord Kintore. The noble Earl, Lord Kintore, described the extent to which landowners now co-operate with various bodies and authorities. I believe that is true not only in relation to that aspect but across the whole environmental spectrum. Over the past three or four years there has been tremendous co-operation between those who use land or admit to land and those who seek to regulate how it is used and admitted. There is much greater co-operation in that regard now.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para19"></a>I believe that the spirit of the amendment is borne out in practice. The provisions of the Bill as regards compulsory purchase reflect an identical arrangement which has operated satisfactorily for river purification boards since 1951. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will feel that what has worked successfully in the past will continue to work successfully in the future.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para20"></a>I should point out that the clause as drafted already requires the Secretary of State to authorise SEPA to purchase land compulsorily. The noble Earl referred to that as dated, confiscatory prose but the involvement of the Secretary of State should reassure both my noble <P>


<a name="column_1223"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend and the noble Earl because the Secretary of State will act as a safety net against any such unreasonable use of such powers. In a sense, he acts to protect against the abuse of those powers.
<P>

<a name="50126-13_para21"></a>Perhaps I may respond to my noble friend Lord Elton by saying that the Secretary of State is unlikely to authorise the necessary consent to SEPA without sufficient reason being given for the use of that compulsory purchase power. Therefore, I ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50126-14_para11"></a>Amendment No. 170A is included in this group of amendments. It deals with Clause 30 which does not appear at present to mention farming, forestry and the rural economy. Those aspects are essential for the preservation of the countryside and of local communities. Amendment No. 170A seeks to rectify that omission. Its wording is taken from Section 3 of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991 which sets out the duty of Scottish Natural Heritage to take account of certain matters in exercising its functions.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para12"></a>Scottish Natural Heritage has been successful in its work for the environment in Scotland. Its balanced approach is widely regarded as being fair and successful.

<a name="50126-14_para16"></a>I am really saying that if things can have architectural interest&#151;which they certainly can&#151;there are also many things which can have engineering interest, which is quite separate and different. That fact should appear on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para17"></a>I wish to outline a situation which is somewhat fanciful. If we desired to preserve, for example, the Forth Bridge on some future occasion, it would be because it is a great engineering achievement and one on which no architect laid a hand. At present, it would be rather good if the Forth Bridge received a coat of paint; but that is a totally different matter.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para18"></a>Perhaps I may refer to a less fanciful situation. Clearly, the Forth Bridge would be preserved under some guise. For example, let us suppose that under privatisation the railway line (which the noble Earl will <P>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>know well) up to Mallaig were to be abandoned. It is quite feasible that it could be. Not many people travel on the line. In that case, we would have to consider the Glen Finnan viaduct, a great mass concrete structure which is not architectural, historical or archaeological. It is, however, of great engineering interest. It was built by Sir Robert McAlpine whose grandson is a Member on the Benches opposite. If that viaduct were to be preserved in the future&#151;as, indeed, it ought to be&#151;the reason would be its great engineering significance and not any other. I see that the noble Lord, Lord McAlpine, has entered the Chamber. I hope that the noble Lord takes his seat so that I can congratulate his grandfather, "Concrete Bob". I am glad to see that he has done so.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para19"></a>When we debated the matter last week, the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, looked pretty kindly on my amendments. However, I believe that he thought I was slightly churlish in my reception of his response. I hope that I can reassure the noble Viscount that that is not so. I hope also that the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, will be at least as accommodating so that we can reach some agreement along the lines I have suggested. I believe that that would greatly enhance the Bill and greatly please the engineering profession.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, has given the Committee a most interesting trip around the historic engineering sites of Scotland. I wonder whether the noble Lord knows (again, this is a diversion) that within the Glen Finnan viaduct, there is, not a human body, but that of a horse, which fell in while concrete was being poured in. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get the animal out. That is one of the stories I have heard; no doubt, the noble Lord will be more familiar with it.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para20"></a>I endorse some of the remarks that have been made. Perhaps I may first deal with Amendment No. 166 which is tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford. The purpose of the amendment is to give a duty to further conservation across all the functions of SEPA. The duty proposed for SEPA in the Bill is to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have regard to the desirability of conserving and enhancing".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para21"></a>This strikes me as being a rather weak duty. I am advised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that Scotland should be able to do better. This amendment, which is put forward by that body, and which I and my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford are only too pleased to submit to the Government, would give the agency a duty to further wildlife heritage demands rather than just have regard to them. We seek to make this duty more positive rather than a purely passive one.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para22"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 167 is again to give a duty to further conservation across all the functions of SEPA. It is a brief amendment to Clause 30 and will strengthen the environmental duty for SEPA. The proposal to give SEPA only a weak duty in relation to the natural heritage of Scotland is not convincing or too satisfactory. The duty to have regard to the desirability of doing that is rather weak. I would suggest that the words of the amendment are preferable.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para23"></a>We shall reach Amendment No. 186 later. It is grouped with the amendments I have been discussing. This amendment removes an unnecessary burden on Scottish Natural Heritage to provide SEPA with predictions as to why important sites might be vulnerable to SEPA's activities. I will move these amendments when the time comes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-14_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I feel that I must apologise to the Committee for not bringing into my original remarks Amendment No. 170A. However, I am very glad to say that the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, did bring it in. Equally, I feel that unless this Bill and SEPA help farmers, foresters and fisheries, urban rules and regulations will kill rural industries and development. I also very much support the principle behind Amendment No. 173 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. I feel that, if we can have statutory rights of access to information held by SEPA, I personally shall feel that the situation is better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I rise in this debate to support the amendments that have been tabled by my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon. I must advise the Committee that when a similar amendment was discussed earlier in the Committee's proceedings it was rather late at night and it would not have been useful for the Committee to hear more speakers at that time of night. However, tonight&#151;thank goodness!&#151;we are discussing this matter a little earlier and it gives me great pleasure to support my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon with regard to his amendments.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para24"></a>The Committee needs to be aware that, although the previous debate held in Committee involved only the one speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, that does not signify that he was the only one who felt the subject was important. I would remind the Committee that earlier today we discussed at Question Time a Starred Question which concerned the importance of science and technology. There was support for what was proposed from all around the Chamber. I was going to suggest&#151;however, there was limited time&#151;two of the things that the Government could do, bearing in mind the shortage of engineers in both Houses of Parliament. First, the Government could promote the idea among all political parties that they should select for election to the other place candidates who were engineers. Also, as regards the membership of this Chamber, whenever the powers that be consider conferring peerages, the qualifications of engineers should also be highly regarded in terms of elevation to the peerage.
<P>

<a name="50126-14_para25"></a>As regards the consideration of this Bill, one of the ways in which we can give support to the very important role in our society and our lives which is played by engineering and engineering structures is to support this amendment. I believe it would send a message not only to the engineering community in this country that its work was supported and recognised, but also to the public at large that Parliament felt that the contribution of engineers, and of these engineering structures that we <P>


<a name="column_1227"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are talking about, is important. With those few words I hope that the Government will look sympathetically on these amendments.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-15_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   In response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, it is not the quantity of engineers that one has in either Chamber but the quality that is important. This Chamber is lucky to have the noble Lord, Lord Howie. He is probably worth 100 engineers put together. Therefore we have no need of others.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para0"></a>As I think the Committee can guess, railwaymen when they get together&#151;even if they are staring across this Chamber&#151;have a rather blurred vision of each other. It is not always accurate but nevertheless it is warm. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howie, for his kind remarks. Like the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, I thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the Western Highlands, and indeed the Forth Rail Bridge, which he gave us. As regards the Forth Rail Bridge a period of research and analysis is being undertaken at the moment to assess different systems of maintenance and of painting. I do not want the noble Lord to think there is inactivity with regard to the bridge. This is simply a time for deciding on the best way forward. I am sad that my noble friend Lord McAlpine is not in his seat because I think his grandfather's viaduct on the West Highland Line is indeed one of the finest there is.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para1"></a>I now turn to this group of amendments. I start with Amendment No. 165A, which seeks to set out who my right honourable friend should consult before issuing guidance to SEPA with respect to its aims and objectives. Of course, this guidance must include guidance in relation to the contribution SEPA is to make towards the Government's goal of sustainable development, and my right honourable friend has already announced that he will consult fully on the content of this guidance.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para2"></a>In the light of his commitment, I do not see any need for the specific list of consultees proposed in this amendment in the names of my noble friend Lord Balfour and the noble Earl, Lord Kintore. I am happy to assure both noble Earls that all eight specific bodies listed in the amendment will be consulted, as will such industrial and landowning groups as the CBI and the Scottish Landowners' Federation. Indeed, I would expect the consultation to go much wider than that. The Committee may for instance be interested to know that over 160 comments were received on the original SEPA consultation in 1992.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 166 to 168 seek to strengthen the Secretary of State's and SEPA's environmental duties. Amendments Nos. 166 and 167 would mean that rather than "having regard to the desirability" of conserving and enhancing the natural heritage of Scotland, they would be required to "further" such matters. Amendment No. 168 would have a similar effect in relation to the protection and conservation of certain buildings and sites.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para4"></a>The Committee will be familiar with this debate, as these issues were raised in relation to the duties on the environment agency for England and Wales in Clause 7. Therefore, I do not wish to dwell at length on Clause <P>


<a name="column_1228"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>30 because of the extent to which we aired all those issues on another occasion. However, I wish to make a few points.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para5"></a>The Bill recognises that matters such as nature conservation are important, and SEPA should, where appropriate, take account of them. However, a duty to further nature conservation could distort the exercise of SEPA's pollution control functions, and its pollution prevention and control functions lie at the heart of its very existence. Few pollution control licences could be issued if SEPA were required to ensure that the levels of pollution they permitted furthered nature conservation.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para6"></a>Unlike the provisions for the Environment Agency for England and Wales, there is no need to make a distinction in the Scottish provisions between SEPA's pollution control and other functions. The more limited scope of the Scottish agency means that it will not have functions for which a duty to "further" would be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para7"></a>It is for that reason that SEPA's constituent bodies have no such "furtherance" duties. However, SEPA's duties will not be any weaker. Indeed, given that the full range of SEPA's environmental and recreational duties are not currently imposed on all of its constituent bodies, the new duties will be broader in their application.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howie, also raised in Amendments Nos. 169, 170, 171, 172 and 174 the question of whether engineering structures fall within the scope of SEPA's environmental duties. I can assure the noble Lord that if he withdraws the amendments I will ensure that the further consideration promised by my noble friend Lord Ullswater in relation to the equivalent provisions for the Environment Agency for England and Wales is extended to cover the relevant provisions for SEPA.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para9"></a>Amendment No. 170A seeks to give SEPA much wider general duties in relation to carrying out its functions. SEPA will need to take account of many such matters, all of which could be covered by specific references to duties in the Bill. These are matters which the guidance issued under Clause 29 was designed to address. I therefore do not see the need for the amendment, although I understand what it seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para10"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Kintore, drew a parallel with Scottish Natural Heritage and the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act and what he saw as the balanced duties imposed on SNH. He quite rightly said that SEPA needs the same balanced duties. Indeed, it does have the same balanced duties. I draw the noble Earl's attention to the guidance which must be issued in the pursuit of its duties. I also draw his attention to the fact that any body seeking to contribute to sustainable development can only do so in a balanced manner. The concept behind sustainable development is that one balances and reconciles different needs and requirements.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para11"></a>I must also point out that SNH legislation is designed for a specific body which has been set up for a specific purpose. The clauses relating to SEPA are designed for a specific body set up for a specific purpose. Therefore, to seek to mirror clauses from one Act in another is not something that the Government would like to consider.
<P>


<a name="column_1229"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para12"></a>Amendment No. 186 would remove the requirement on Scottish Natural Heritage to give SEPA reasons for considering that an area of land may be affected by activities or authorisations of SEPA.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para13"></a>Clause 33 requires SNH to notify SEPA of sites of special interest or natural heritage areas which SNH considers may be affected by actions by SEPA. I believe that it is appropriate for SNH to be additionally obliged to make the reasons for its considerations known to SEPA. SEPA must, except in an emergency, consult SNH where it appears likely to SEPA that its actions may affect such land. Knowing why SNH thought that the land might be so affected in the first place would, I suggest, help SEPA meet that obligation.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para14"></a>Amendment No. 187 would restrict the definition of emergency to "danger to life or health". That would limit the circumstances in which the consultation arrangements could be circumvented. I recognise that we should be careful to avoid any unnecessary abuses of that exemption, but I do not believe that this is the best way of doing so as it would fetter SEPA's discretion to an unreasonable extent. For example, it does not seem to cover an emergency which may cause serious environmental harm. Much would depend on how "life" was interpreted. Contamination of soil may not directly threaten life but it could well constitute an emergency. We should be prepared to trust SEPA to discharge its statutory functions to protect the environment when it believes it is imperative to do so urgently.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para15"></a>There is, of course, still a requirement on SEPA, if it takes emergency action, to notify SNH as soon as practicable after the event.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para16"></a>The Government are keen to ensure the correct balance is struck in SEPA's environmental duties. We believe that the provisions as drafted achieve that. On that basis, I hope that Members of the Committee will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-15_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 175 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 176 to 181. These amendments are intended to strengthen the independence of SEPA and to reduce the total power which seems to rest with the Secretary of State, who <P>


<a name="column_1230"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>generally speaking has sufficient power in any case. We want a body which will have a certain amount of autonomy. We are not opposed to the establishment of SEPA; we feel that it should be more representative.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para24"></a>The amendments are tabled because under the Bill as currently drafted assessments will be undertaken only at the discretion of the Secretary of State. We believe that SEPA should be free to provide regular assessments of the effects of pollution on the environment on a proactive basis. Otherwise SEPA may be requested to carry out assessments only in response to a crisis rather than using these studies to tackle issues before they become problems. That is the purpose of Amendments Nos. 176, 177 and 178.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para25"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 179 is to ensure that, unlike other quangos, the working of the agency will not be shrouded in mystery. The Minister has already said that it would be going too far for board meetings and other meetings to be open to the public. I hope that he will come a little way with us and give us a reassurance that there will not be any secrecy which is detrimental to the public.
<P>

<a name="50126-15_para26"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 180 is to ensure that environmental costs and benefits are accounted for in identifying options for pollution prevention. When considering the costs and benefits of options for pollution control it is critically important that the environmental costs and benefits are clearly outlined. Many of SEPA's measurements of success will be the environmental benefits&#151;clean water, clean air and clean land&#151;which accrue from its actions. Therefore, it will assist SEPA to undertake some analysis of both the short and long-term costs and benefits to the environment which result from its action or lack of action. If it is lack of action, that may spur it on to do something more quickly. As the relationship between environmental economics and cost-benefit analysis remains a matter for debate, it should be clear on the face of the Bill that SEPA is expected to consider the environment as well as financial costs and benefits in the clause. Although it may be possible to do a purely financial analysis, in the long run from the ecological point of view that may prove to be disastrous. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some reassurance on those points. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-16_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Before my noble friend Lord Lindsay replies, perhaps I may say a word on Amendment No. 181B. It is a government amendment to Clause 31. Perhaps the Committee will also consider Clause 5, which is the mirror clause. Perhaps I may cite briefly from Clause 5. There is reference to the Alkali &c., Works Regulation Act 1906. That has been included in the Scottish provisions. There is reference to the river purification provisions which apply to Scotland. There is also reference to Part I of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which deals with waste on land. Why has Part I of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 not been included in the Scottish provisions of Clause 31? I note from the amendment <P>


<a name="column_1231"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989 will appear in both clauses. I do not need to go further. However, I wished to ask that question before my noble friend speaks.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_time0"></a><H5>6.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-16_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I begin by speaking to Amendments Nos. 181 and 181B. Once again, I compliment my noble friend Lord Balfour for putting forward his analysis of the way in which the drafting of the Bill may need improvement. Again, I shall ensure that his suggestions are passed on. Perhaps I may draw my noble friend's attention to Clause 31(5) (b) where he may find some relief. I shall certainly provide him with some more prep. to do tonight before he reports tomorrow morning.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para0"></a>These amendments seek to include within the definition of "pollution control powers" and "pollution control functions" for the purposes of Clause 31, references to Part 1A of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, which is inserted by this Bill and deals with abandoned mines, and the Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989, which makes provision for the registration of waste carriers.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para1"></a>Equivalent references are already included in the definitions with respect to the Environment Agency for England and Wales at Clause 5(5). I presume that those amendments will be moved in the normal chronological order.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para2"></a>I turn now to the amendments so ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. Amendment No. 175 would put "protecting the environment" on an equal footing with SEPA's purpose to exercise its pollution prevention and control functions. I think that the amendment seeks to make an artificial distinction. What is pollution prevention and control if not protecting the environment?
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para3"></a>The term "protecting the environment", of course, goes much wider. That is why we are placing other, more general, environmental duties on the agency. However, I think it would be confusing if we were to weaken SEPA's raison d'&#234;tre: the effective control of pollution, which is a vital element in protecting the environment at large.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para4"></a>Amendment No. 176 and the consequential Amendment No. 178 would require SEPA to carry out and report on assessments of environmental pollution, without the need for them to be first requested by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para5"></a>I understand the noble Lord's concern that, as drafted, it might appear that SEPA would be unduly constrained by the current provisions. I can assure him that it is in fact not so. Clause 31(2) places a duty on SEPA to compile information relating to pollution. SEPA's general and incidental functions in Clause 35 would also enable it to do anything which would facilitate or is conducive to the carrying on of its functions. Carrying out assessments of environmental pollution and reporting its findings of its own volition would certainly fall into that category.
<P>


<a name="column_1232"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para6"></a>The provision in Clause 31 is merely to clarify the relationship between my right honourable friend and the agency. It gives him a specific power to require SEPA to carry out such assessments and report its findings to him; and I think it is right and proper that he is able to direct the agency in that way.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para7"></a>Amendment No. 177 links SEPA's duty to undertake assessments of environmental pollution with its duty to report on options for preventing or controlling pollution.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para8"></a>I can certainly see that, in some instances, it would be appropriate for such an assessment to be followed up with a report on the options for preventing or controlling such pollution. But I do not think it necessarily follows in all cases. For example, an assessment may show that the level of pollution is below limits requiring any action; or the assessment may be of a very general nature for information purposes only.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para9"></a>I also do not feel that Amendment No. 179 is required. Some reports will, of course, be of interest to Parliament and it is right and proper that when they are my right honourable friend places copies in the Libraries of the House. But I do not believe that that will always be the case.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para10"></a>Amendment No. 180 seeks to define the costs and benefits identified in reports on the options for preventing or controlling pollution in financial and environmental terms. In principle, we share the belief that costs and benefits should not be viewed in narrow economic terms. Yet by seeking to define them more closely the noble Lord may be excluding other important matters such as social costs and benefits.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para11"></a>The present drafting has a wider meaning which already encompasses the matters specified in the amendment. I can assure the Committee that non-financial aspects will not be ignored.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para12"></a>Amendment No. 181 would have two effects: first, to change SEPA's duty to "follow" developments in techniques to prevent or control pollution, so that it would "promote" them; and, secondly, to include a specific reference to "damage to the aquatic environment".
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para13"></a>As my noble friend explained in last week's debate on a comparable amendment to the duties on the environment agency, a duty to "follow" developments is not passive. Those developments will underpin SEPA's application of BATNEEC in relation to Part I of the 1990 Act.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para14"></a>Moreover, Clause 35 places SEPA under a duty to conduct research which could cover such developments, where appropriate. On that basis, I do not believe that there would be value in imposing such an undefined promotional role on SEPA. That is more properly a concern of others. Nor do I believe that the further refinement of this duty to highlight the aquatic environment is appropriate or necessary. The whole purpose of SEPA is to move away from regarding the environment in separate segments. We must recognise that the environmental media are often <P>


<a name="column_1233"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interdependent. To highlight one of them would therefore be a step backwards. SEPA is a step forward into a more integrated, inter-disciplinary era.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para15"></a>On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<br>
("( ) reviewing and revising all existing codes of practice in the light of new authorities and responsibilities within three years of SEPA's establishment").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50126-16_para31"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of Amendments, Nos. 189, 190 and 191, concerns SEPA. With Amendment No. 189 we feel that SEPA, combined with the new water authorities under the local government reorganisation, will create quite a different grouping. We therefore believe that the existing codes may not be relevant, and they should at least be redrawn, reviewed and rewritten for the new circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para32"></a>Amendment No. 190 asks that since all the bodies detailed as consultees are quangos, if there is to be any degree of public accountability, the list must include as <P>


<a name="column_1234"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>a matter of priority some democratically elected councillors who represent the interests of those affected by the services which SEPA is to provide.
<P>

<a name="50126-16_para33"></a>The Minister may already have answered that point on an earlier amendment when he said that there would be a selection from local authorities on SEPA. I await his answer on this point. I should like the three amendments to be considered. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Amendment No. 189 would require the Secretary of State to review and revise existing codes of practice within three years of SEPA's establishment. Amendment No. 190 would in effect add the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, COSLA, to the list of bodies he has to consult before approving a code of practice. Amendment No. 191 would similarly add Historic Scotland and the Scottish Sports Council while Amendment No. 191ZA would add owners of land and industrialists.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para0"></a>A statutory review of codes of practice within three years of SEPA's establishment appears to be unduly prescriptive. I would certainly expect that to be achieved, but do not believe that this need be set out on the face of the Bill. It would appear to be a fairly modest objective for SEPA's corporate planning process.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para1"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that it is important that the views of Historic Scotland are fed into the process of approving a code of practice. But as that body is an executive agency of the Scottish Office, a requirement on the Secretary of State to consult Historic Scotland is tantamount to obliging him to consult himself.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para2"></a>As SEPA will not have the range of responsibilities of the Environment Agency, I do not believe the Scottish Sports Council has a strong enough interest in the activities of SEPA to justify its specific and automatic inclusion. Indeed, it is often unlikely to have any interest. I accept that COSLA and owners of land or industrialists are likely to have a valid interest more frequently. However, if it is appropriate to do so in relation to a particular code, my right honourable friend will consult these parties among others. I am not aware of any anxieties in Scotland about the range of bodies to be consulted. I believe that the consultation arrangements already on the face of the Bill are sufficient to meet the noble Lord's worries. I therefore hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I think that the Minister's answer is slightly disappointing. The amendments were not put down by any means to try to tie the Secretary of State's hands but rather to get the various bodies in Scotland enthusiastically behind SEPA. I am sorry that the opportunity has not been taken. I should have thought that three years would be sufficient to write a new code; we should know how and whether it is working by that time. I am also marginally disappointed that there was a certain holding back in co-operation on that. Perhaps we could come back to these small but important amendments on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 189.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para10"></a>The main purpose of the Bill is to modify existing legislation in order to place South Africa on an equal footing with other Commonwealth countries, following South Africa's resumption of Commonwealth membership on 1st June last year. This has been welcomed not only in this House and on all sides of it, but throughout the length and breadth of our country, in the Commonwealth and, not least of all, South Africa itself. That was emphasised to me only today by the Deputy High Commissioner, Mr. Gert Grobler.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para11"></a>The Bill involves purely technical amendments to a number of Acts, in order to apply them to South Africa. It deals with South Africa's relationship with the Commonwealth Institute; it reinstates the right of the Government of South Africa to appoint a trustee to the board of the Imperial War Museum. It makes some amendments to our legislation so that South African forces are included in the definition of Commonwealth forces with implications for their legal status when, for example, training in this country. It makes provision for the exercise of command and discipline when British forces and Commonwealth forces are serving together and for attachment of members of one force to another.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para12"></a>The immigration and electoral implications of South Africa's return to the Commonwealth have been dealt with separately by an Order in Council made on 22nd <P>


<a name="column_1236"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>June last year. That order added South Africa to the list of Commonwealth countries included in Schedule 3 to the British Nationality Act 1981.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para13"></a>The return of South Africa to the Commonwealth after an absence of some 30 years is a cause for celebration in all Commonwealth countries.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para14"></a>These have been long years for South Africa, years of isolation: isolated from the West because it affronted democratic values; isolated in Africa because of its treatment of Africans and others. But South Africa was never forgotten. It was never out of our affections. We knew that change must come. Her return is a reminder both of the gulf that opened up between our two countries after 1961 and of the closeness of our historical ties with all the peoples of South Africa.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para15"></a>Britain has a formidable relationship with South Africa. Almost 1 million people of British descent live in that country. Our peoples are inextricably linked in all manner of public and private relationships: in business, and through cultural, sporting, scientific, military and political ties. Britain also has a very substantial economic interest in South Africa. Our investment there has an estimated market value of over 40 million rand&#151;greater than our investment in the whole of the rest of Africa combined. It shows the depth of Britain's national commitment to South Africa. But that commitment is not one-way. The United Kingdom is South Africa's second largest supplier; Britain is South Africa's second largest export market.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para16"></a>I believe that we can now truly say that we are re-united: re-united in the Commonwealth as true democracies; re-united as trading partners; and re-united in seeking solutions for the problems of Africa.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para17"></a>I commend the Bill to the House and trust that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thurlow: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, for introducing this short and mainly formal Bill. But the House would not wish to let the occasion pass without our joining the noble Lord in expressing once again our very sincere joy at the re-entry of South Africa to the family of the Commonwealth, and our desire to support the new government in all its daunting tasks to the extent of our ability. Her departure from the Commonwealth was self-imposed; and the mad and hateful imposition of apartheid led to exclusion and international ostracism. The momentous historical change that led up to the formation of the first truly democratic parliament and government of the republic has been welcomed throughout the world. The new government's early application to rejoin the Commonwealth was acclaimed by all members. A vital limb of the Commonwealth was cut off when South Africa left. It is now restored.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para19"></a>Noble Lords will, I hope, allow me to go back in time to the distant days before the war when there were only five full Commonwealth members, and, after 1947, eight. In the Commonwealth then, the Dominion of South Africa played a full and active part in <P>


<a name="column_1237"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commonwealth counsels and her steadily expanding resources put her in a unique position south of the Sahara. This is not a mere historical reflection, for her role and influence then in the Commonwealth and in international affairs illustrates the immense potential role of South Africa in the continent in the challenging years ahead. South Africa's notable military contribution in the war and her constructive contribution in the post-war Commonwealth counsels meant, as I said, that a void was left.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para20"></a>I once had to convey to Field Marshal Smuts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1946 a very awkward last-minute request to execute a U-turn over our policy regarding the future of Libya. It put him in a most embarrassing position vis-o-vis his colleagues. He nevertheless accepted without demur and at once simply to help the British Government. South Africa carried international weight then and the new pluralistic democracy can and should achieve still greater international influence again and make a unique contribution throughout Africa south of the Sahara.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para21"></a>Of course South Africa faces great difficulties, especially in meeting&#151;as I expect the noble Lord, Lord St. John, will remind us&#151;the unrealistic expectation of a miraculous transformation of the quality of life of the great mass of unemployed and deprived in the shanty towns. We pay tribute to the courage, wisdom and readiness to put the past behind that President Mandela and Vice-president de Klerk have shown. They have demonstrated consummate leadership in the face of daunting challenges.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para22"></a>As has been asserted on a number of occasions in recent weeks in this House, it is an obligation on this country to do everything we can to support the priority goals of the South African Government, with emphasis on education and health in public sector aid, but also to give assistance in the fields of public administration, police reform and small business development. I hope that the earmarking of the initial &#163;100 million for bilateral help may soon be increased. In the private sector every facility should be given to British business to play the maximum part in new enterprise and investment. That clearly requires the maximum stability. Any ways in which the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth can help must command our support. The Commonwealth Secretariat is no doubt playing its part.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para23"></a>The vast stakes involved go far beyond even the enormous bounds of South Africa itself. The whole of Africa south of the Sahara has been in racial turmoil and economic decline for years, with only a few recent bright beacons of hope such as Ghana's impressive resurgence. I look forward to the day when the new South Africa will join hands with other Commonwealth governments south of the Sahara to supply guidance and resources perhaps in new forms that may be harbingers of an entirely new and more hopeful dawn of greater stability and expansion throughout the continent. As a flight of fancy, I like to imagine what co-operation between 100 million in a restored Nigerian democracy <P>


<a name="column_1238"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the human and material resources of South Africa could give in pilot projects of social and economic value. I believe that we cannot exaggerate that.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para24"></a>The first building blocks must probably be mainly in education and health. New methods of accelerated education may be forged in the social pressures of the new South Africa. Any such initiatives must receive every possible support from this country. The potential for transformation of the continent under South African leadership is almost infinite. We send our sincere good wishes to her Government and people: to her leaders and to all who are engaged in the many urgent tasks. And we take this opportunity again to record our desire to give support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew8"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, I too approach this debate with a sense of joy. A few years ago the possibility of the readmission of South Africa into the Commonwealth would have been unthinkable. But here we are in a new and exciting situation. Over 30 years ago Harold Macmillan, as Prime Minister, spoke of the wind of change blowing through Africa. That wind of change has finally blown away apartheid.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para25"></a>The event was celebrated in the sermon at the special Commonwealth service in Westminster Abbey by the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, as symbolising the return of the prodigal son. However, as with the return of the prodigal, one should not assume that all is well in the immediate family. True reconciliation can only take place once the truth is known. The injustices of the past that are manifested in the pain of today will not disappear. They cannot be swept under the carpet. The readmission of South Africa to the Commonwealth is not only a question of drafting the appropriate legislation, although clearly that must be done; it is an opportunity for us to think creatively of the way in which we can today help to right the wrongs of the past.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para26"></a>The visit of Prime Minister John Major to South Africa occurred in happy circumstances. During that visit the Prime Minister explicitly encouraged investment in the country. That is of the highest importance. The tremendous step of transition to a democratic society which is no longer based on the principle of racial discrimination requires a sound economic and financial basis. Therefore, it is to be welcomed that, on the one hand, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are viewing sympathetically the claims of South Africa, and that, on the other, in the private sector, firms are seeking to invest in people and projects.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para27"></a>I have to utter a word of caution. While welcoming both public and private investment, that should not reinforce the inequality between the races. The South African Council of Churches and other organisations have sought to establish a code of conduct for investors, laying down the principles for investment. Such a code seeks to encourage investments that will serve to build up the country rather than perpetuate the divisions and the inequality that continue to exist.
<P>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para28"></a>There is now widespread support from all sections of the population, including much of the white community, for the reconstruction and development programme of the South African Government. Much more, though, is needed in terms of inward flows of capital to fund that programme. The government have, as has already been mentioned, a massive task, particularly in the fields of housing, education and employment.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para29"></a>It is to the Churches that the Minister of Education in South Africa recently appealed. The new South African Government plan to provide adequate education for all South African children, black and white. Historically, the Churches have sought to increase educational opportunity for all. Their efforts reach back to a time long before the distortions of apartheid education. The current needs for education are far beyond the resources of the new government and the Churches put together.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para30"></a>Recently, Archbishop Desmond Tutu's main educational adviser visited the Churches and aid agencies in Britain to place before them the needs and opportunities in the educational sector. The South African Churches have, as an urgent task, the further formulation of a detailed programme to complement the leading responsibility of the government. The assistance and expertise of other governments, including our own and those of our partners in the European Union, will be required.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para31"></a>In the six months leading up to the first truly democratic elections in South Africa, I had the privilege of seconding one of my senior diocesan staff to Natal as part of the international church monitoring team. He saw for himself the enormity of the task that lies ahead: the need for rebuilding homes, the education system, a police service rather than an armed force; and, most importantly, building trust and reconciliation between groups that have been at war with each other. Those tasks and opportunities are tremendous.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para32"></a>I believe that we must do all that we can, bilaterally and multilaterally, through the European Union, to support the reconstruction of post-apartheid South Africa. That can be most effectively achieved through the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development so that the massive task of overcoming the legacy of the past 45 years is addressed as thoroughly and effectively as possible. Support should also be given to the educational programmes of local non-governmental organisations which are currently facing funding difficulties.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para33"></a>Let me make one final point. I believe that, as well as supporting South Africa, it is vital to the future of the whole region that Her Majesty's Government should support the reconstruction of South Africa's neighbours who were victims for many years of the destabilisation programme of the South African Government. Only by promoting peace and prosperity in the region can we hope to achieve in the long term all that is needed for the people of South Africa.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para34"></a>The new South Africa needs all the prayer and practical support we can provide. I urge your Lordships to support with open hearts the democratic republic of South Africa, remembering the pain of the past but <P>

<A NAME="50126-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, every one of us rejoices at the return of South Africa to the Commonwealth. The noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, paid an eloquent tribute to Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. In the interests of brevity, I say simply that I endorse everything that he said. Under their leadership, not only have we seen a remarkably peaceful general election, but also we have seen emerge an assumption that the redress of ancient grievances should be looked for not through violence but through the institutions of government. That is an enormous step forward.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para35"></a>There are bound to be problems&#151;for example, over the pace of progress with the reconstruction and development programme&#151;and there may be tribal rivalries. But I want to mention some grounds for hope. First, there is a leadership dedicated to parliamentary democracy and human rights. Secondly, South Africa has the most powerful economy in Africa and a strong private sector. It has immense natural resources. Thirdly, apartheid has been crumbling for some time. It was not simply a matter of a sudden and shallow-rooted decision by the white government in 1990 that Nelson Mandela should be released from prison and that there would be a totally new course&#151;although the white leadership at that time deserves credit for taking the decisions that they took.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para36"></a>One needs to look further back. In the 1980s, apartheid was already dissolving in practice. Despite laws about segregation on the sports field, in factories, in offices, on trains and in restaurants, apartheid was crumbling. The process has been compared by a writer for the South African Institute of Race Relations, Mr John Kane-Berman, to the Industrial Revolution which ushered in democracy in England. I give one example of what was happening. In 1988 the five-star Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg reported that 50 per cent. of its weekend packages were purchased by blacks.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para37"></a>With the biggest economy in Africa, South Africa has a particular role to play in helping to develop the economy of the whole of southern Africa. The right reverend Prelate referred to that important point. South Africa has already been welcomed as a member of the Southern African Development Community. With peace now in Zimbabwe and Namibia, which are both members of the Commonwealth, in Mozambique and one hopes soon also in Angola, there is a new opportunity for economic progress in the region which can be led by South Africa.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para38"></a>We should not underestimate the extent to which South Africa looks to this country. As my noble friend Lord Inglewood remarked, she has a million residents of United Kingdom descent. It is significant that she has sought from this country a training mission for her defence forces. I welcome also the aid which we have been giving and plan to give to South Africa. For years we have been developing projects in townships and rural areas, planning for a future after apartheid. British investment in South Africa is greater than in the whole <P>


<a name="column_1241"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the rest of Africa put together. We are South Africa's second largest supplier and her second largest export market.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para39"></a>Our Government are right to be building on these links. They are good for South Africa. They are good for us. If she is to surmount her problems, South Africa needs the help and encouragement of her friends. They in turn will benefit from relations with her. It is not only right that South Africa should return to the Commonwealth. She will be to it an ornament and a strength.

<A NAME="50126-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord St. John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, I join in welcoming this Bill and the provisions relating to South Africa's readmission as a member of the Commonwealth. Having recently returned from that country, I should like to take this opportunity to make a few general observations.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para40"></a>I have tabled a Motion for short debate on South Africa and hope that the House will soon have an opportunity to discuss recent developments there at greater length. There is a tendency to believe that, following the successful transition to democracy last year, South Africa is no longer a pressing international issue, but it is important to appreciate the invaluable role which that country can play and is playing, both in its own region and within the Commonwealth, and that it will require constant foreign assistance to realise its full potential. With help, the country will grow and reward goodwill and investment. To paraphrase the words of the former United States President, John F. Kennedy, South Africa won't simply ask what the Commonwealth can do for it; it will ask what it can do for the Commonwealth. As a fast-developing power at the southern tip of Africa, with many first-world strengths&#151;roads, rail and high technology&#151;the country is well placed to give as much as it takes.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para41"></a>The new South Africa is barely nine months old, but the evidence of astounding progress is there for all to see. There have been teething problems and many obstacles, but the fledgling nation has astonished the world by the collective warmth of its reconciliation. As I witnessed myself last month, there is an awe-inspiring determination that the new dispensation should work. Everyone feels involved, and the resolutely positive approach is discernible in every walk of life.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para42"></a>High school students in the townships, who until a few years ago were boycotting exams and joining protest riots, told me how they felt so much more positive about their future, feeling at long last as though they were being given a genuine chance. Then there were the deeply conservative Afrikaners, who had once feared the worst, relating how President Mandela was, after all, really not such a bad guy.

<FONT SIZE=3>at the man's naked indecency but at the fact that he should have persisted in displaying a flag which is widely regarded as part of the past, not the future.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para44"></a>Of course, there have also been recent setbacks: the death of Joe Slovo robbed the nation of a Minister who was energetically tackling the urgent need for improved housing and then there was the recent controversy over indemnities offered to members of the security forces shortly before last year's general election. ANC Justice Minister Dullah Omah announced that the indemnities would not apply. Deputy President F. W. de Klerk objected in the strongest possible terms. Soon thereafter a meeting with President Mandela was swiftly arranged and last week, in the spirit of national unity, another crisis was narrowly averted.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para45"></a>Against this firmly positive background, the Government in South Africa must perform a balancing act: on the one hand, as my noble friend Lord Thurlow has already mentioned, it must meet the raised expectations of the majority; and on the other, it must constantly reassure the white minority on whom economic and social prosperity depend.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para46"></a>I should have liked to speak further on the South African Government's reconstruction and development programme and their bold initiatives in the key areas of unemployment, education, health care and land reform, but I appreciate that these issues lie beyond the terms of this Second Reading debate. My noble friend Lord Thurlow and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark have eloquently put the case forward for greater assistance in education, housing and unemployment. The South African Government have much to achieve at home, but they are also eager to play a full and active role within the Commonwealth. There is a general realisation that, amid the uncertainties of the post-cold war world, the Commonwealth represents a beacon of stability and is a forceful promoter of dialogue, democracy and human rights.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para47"></a>The visit of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh to South Africa in March this year is eagerly awaited and will set a final seal on South Africa's readmission to the Commonwealth.

<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, this Bill completes the formalities in the United Kingdom of South Africa's readmission as a member of the Commonwealth, and so brings this chapter in history to a close. The main thrust of my contribution has been touched upon in differing ways. If I might be criticised for duplication tonight, I would ask for it to be perceived as emphasis.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para48"></a>It might be appropriate to touch on some of the benefits of membership of the Commonwealth to South Africa, and ask what Britain in particular can contribute towards that nation's programme of national regeneration. I believe that the Commonwealth can now play a pivotal role in facilitating South Africa's consolidation as a post-apartheid democracy. Indeed, the Commonwealth Secretariat's long-standing experience with pluralist societies can help South Africa steer a steady course. Fellow Commonwealth states can help <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>rebuild burnt bridges as South Africa undertakes its enhanced responsibilities, as an upstanding and important member of the international community. A thriving multi-racial democracy would act as an ideal flagship to all countries in the region looking for hope and leadership. She will stand as a living testimony to the Commonwealth's strength of purpose and the timeless validity of its principles and ideals.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para49"></a>South Africa offers a wealth of economic opportunity. The Commonwealth has every interest in exploring all possibilities and should, at once, examine effective measures for human resource development. Indeed, South Africa's economic expansion will be predetermined by the skill and ingenuity of her workforce. Britain and South Africa enjoy a unique relationship that can ill afford neglect. Britain has invested &#163;56 billion into South Africa and, since apartheid's collapse, we have emerged as her premier trading partner.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para50"></a>We have merely scratched the surface. We must take advantage of our specialist business expertise, and build upon this heightened mood of economic confidence. The recent visit of our Prime Minister has consolidated the basis for co-operation. Trade missions form a vital part of this ongoing economic thrust, as exemplified by the Minister for trade's visit last year and an anticipated 14 missions planned for 1995. I ask the Export Credit Guarantee Department and NCM to constantly address availability and competitiveness of their premiums.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para51"></a>We should commit ourselves to greater levels of inward investment with a view to broadening British commercial interests and strengthening South Africa's economic infrastructure. Indisputably, Britain can occupy a commanding position in the technical field in South Africa as the dexterity of her labour market increases. The ODA must rise to meet such challenges with both innovation and vision, in concert with other governmental organisations such as the DTI.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para52"></a>In return what does the new South Africa offer? In a world where regional strife is commonplace we can rely on a reborn South Africa to act as a bulwark against similar unrest in the region. She has a commitment to conflict resolution illustrated by her intervention, for example, together with two other Commonwealth member states, Zimbabwe and Botswana, in the Lesotho crisis. Indeed, a resurgent South Africa can lend support to the Commonwealth's commitment to global democratisation and effective peacekeeping arbitration.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para53"></a>South Africa's nascent democracy has already displayed remarkable signs of maturity. I would like to reinforce the United Kingdom's dedication to her continued growth and wish this Bill a speedy passage.

But like everyone who has spoken, I welcome the Bill and the fact that under its very brief text it reflects an historic event; namely, the return of a multi-racial South Africa to the family of the Commonwealth.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para54"></a>Like others who have spoken, I pay tribute to the courage and vision of South Africa's two leaders, President Mandela and Mr. F. W. de Klerk. The world owes a very great deal to their remarkable joint leadership. The task is now for the countries of the Commonwealth, both through the Commonwealth Secretariat and bilaterally, to do all they can to help with the immense problems of development in South Africa.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para55"></a>The European Union also has a very important role to play. My noble friend Lady Williams wanted to take part in this debate. She has just returned from India. She tells me, for example, that she found the National Human Rights Commission in India very anxious and keen to share with the new South Africa its experience of reconciling racial communities.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para56"></a>In my very few words in this debate I wish to join with the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, and the right reverend Prelate in saying a little about the educational situation in South Africa, particularly among the children of the black townships. The challenge is a huge one. About 45 per cent. of the population is under the age of 15. More than a million black children do not attend school at all. Of those who do, I believe that 300,000 reach only standard 2 and another 400,000 leave at the end of their primary schooling. In addition, 20 per cent. of black teachers are unqualified and half of them are too young to have experienced anything other than Bantu education.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para57"></a>Against that background, I very much welcome the Government's support of around &#163;100 million over three years in development aid to South Africa. I hope that a high priority within the bilateral element of that aid will be given to education, particularly to basic primary education and also to adult literacy. More than half the adult population is estimated to be illiterate.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para58"></a>Despite those rather chilling statistics there is much which is positive on the educational front within South Africa. The country has the biggest European minority in sub-Saharan Africa and it is a well-educated minority. That gives South Africa a platform for moving at a more rapid pace than other developing African nations now that racial equality has been achieved. South Africa also has a relatively large black middle class with good professional qualifications and great entrepreneurial skills. It has much material and agricultural wealth and now that sanctions are behind us presumably that can expand at a much faster rate in terms of self-help within the South African economy.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para59"></a>Potentially, in the medium term, I hope, as the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, and, I believe the right reverend Prelate emphasised, South Africa has the prospect, after being a very divisive force in black Africa, of playing a leading constructive role there. In the short term, however, it is the usual problem of people long deprived expecting too much too quickly. That is why the example of President Mandela and Mr. F. W. de Klerk with their great wisdom and very great self-restraint, remains so very important.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para60"></a>In my last few words about South African education, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Government's overseas development office in South Africa. Perhaps I may quote the words of one of its <P>

<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it is a new experience for me to be able wholeheartedly to support a government Bill at Second Reading in this House. It is a great pleasure to be able to do so but a pleasure I do not anticipate having very often between now and the general election.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para62"></a>I welcome the Bill because what it marks is so many things that we have yearned for for so long&#151;the end of apartheid, the establishment of democracy in South Africa, Nelson Mandela's just reward of the presidency of South Africa after one of the longest and most courageous campaigns for political freedom this century, and the re-entry of South Africa into the Commonwealth.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para63"></a>Like other speakers, I do not wish to comment on the nuts and bolts of this short Bill. I want instead to comment briefly on the relevance and significance of South Africa's renewed membership of the Commonwealth. It is now nearly 34 years since Hendrik Verwoerd took South Africa out of the Commonwealth in May 1961&#151;in fact, jumping before he was pushed. By then most members of the Commonwealth no longer wished to belong to a club of which South Africa was also a member. At that time, the Nationalist Party was pursuing Afrikaner nationalism and crude racist policies, championing racist divisions based on the vulgar notions of white superiority, but it was firmly in power. Opposition to it was silenced and many South African liberals were forced into exile; others ending up in prison. But by then it was already well down the road to making South Africa an international pariah.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para64"></a>In the years that followed, the one issue on which the Commonwealth was united was its hatred of apartheid and its determination to see its perpetrators dismissed and replaced by a new leadership that would promote racial harmony in South Africa. It was perhaps a little too slow to introduce a complete ban on sporting contacts. It was not until 1977 at Gleneagles that agreement was reached, and even then, regrettably, elements in the Conservative Party opposed the agreement, wrongly arguing that a ban on such contacts was undesirable. However, the Gleneagles Agreement paved the way for economic sanctions. Few now dispute that the political, economic, cultural and sporting isolation of South Africa brought about by sanctions helped to turn round the political situation there leading to the eventual abandonment of apartheid.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para65"></a>President Mandela's decision to return South Africa to the Commonwealth has been widely welcomed in Britain, in the rest of the Commonwealth, and, of course, in South Africa itself. It provides an opportunity to forge new links and to foster contact between South <P>


<a name="column_1246"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Africa and other nations which share some of its history. It will mean that South Africa can once again take part in sporting events such as the Commonwealth Games as well as contributing to Commonwealth programmes for young people and to technical co-operation programmes. South Africa will benefit from Commonwealth schemes which provide education and training. That is something to which other noble Lords have referred. In particular, I hope that it will include training for South African blacks to allow them to break into professions and occupations from which they have been entirely or largely excluded.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para66"></a>When the decision to rejoin was made last year, the Commonwealth secretary general spoke of his "special sense of joy". I believe that that is something which we can all share. Indeed, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark used similar words. The secretary general also said that South Africa could count on Commonwealth support in the task of reconciliation and reconstruction in South Africa. That is a task in which the UK should take the lead, given our historical role in South Africa. We owe it to the South African people. Perhaps the Minister can say whether the UK Government have any plans to increase the contribution to support reconstruction during the coming years&#151;over and above the &#163;100 million to which other noble Lords have referred&#151;which they promised from the existing aid budget last year. Given the pressures on that budget, might not a little extra be found for the special case of South Africa? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, that our contribution should be increased, and with the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, that education should have a high priority in that spending.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para67"></a>There is still a great deal to be done. The peaceful conclusion to last year's election after the violence that preceded it is little short of miraculous. But the expectations of the black population in the townships are understandably very high. As the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, suggested, everything possible must be done to help the South African Government to meet those expectations &#151;in the short term by aid programmes and in the medium to longer term through investment in the South African economy which will help to promote economic growth. The latest figures allow us to be reasonably optimistic after poor growth levels in the first part of last year, although growth in the last quarter was rather less than the South African Government had forecast and hoped for. However, the South African Government's ambitious economic programme has been welcomed for its realism and discipline by many economic commentators.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para68"></a>That a multi-racial government has been so successfully established and that South Africa's social institutions have been adapted so rapidly to accommodate a democratic and multiracial approach is a credit to all its people, but it is the black population in particular whom we must salute. Downtrodden and oppressed for so many years, they have shown remarkable forgiveness. Their lack of bitterness or wish for vengeance following the example of their great leader, Nelson Mandela, is a lesson to us all. In those circumstances, their contribution to the Commonwealth can only be positive. Some of its members have still not <P>


<a name="column_1247"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned how to promote and maintain pluralistic, democratic systems. The new South Africa can perhaps be an example to such countries of the way in which democratic principles can triumph against the odds. Certainly, it will want to play an important part within a Commonwealth framework in promoting, through preventive diplomacy, the avoidance of internal conflicts which can so easily lead to civil wars elsewhere in the Commonwealth and, particularly, in Africa.

<a name="50126-17_para69"></a>The Labour Party greatly welcomes the return of South Africa to the international community and to the Commonwealth. In doing so, it supports the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="50126-17_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I very much welcome the harmony of the remarks made by all noble Lords who have spoken. I note that we have had contributions from noble Lords who have held various distinguished roles and who have detailed knowledge of South Africa. I should like to return in a moment to some of the specific points that have been raised, but I must confess to having some slight difficulty in the sense that the tune was so similar that it is difficult to draw out individuals from the music that I have heard played. If I have overlooked any noble Lord's contribution, I hope that I shall be forgiven. The Government very much value this exchange and debate&#151;first, so that we can again reiterate our welcome to South Africa on rejoining the Commonwealth; and, secondly, because that is an important event to the Commonwealth as a whole, and to each and all of its individual members.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para70"></a>The themes that ran through the speeches this evening were those of joy, which must be right, and of respect for the leaders in South Africa who have effected a most dramatic and historically significant transformation. I refer not only to President Mandela because it is important to pay tribute to the previous president, Mr. de Klerk, who has played at least as significant a part in the act of transferring power.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para71"></a>Many noble Lords were properly concerned about the need for aid and about what we in this country are doing to help. Reference was made not only to our own country, but also to the European Union and the Commonwealth which also have significant parts to play. As has been mentioned, the Government have targeted &#163;100 million&#151;a very substantial sum&#151;on South Africa. The key aim is to help directly those who have been disadvantaged by apartheid. Particular <P>


<a name="column_1248"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column 1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>emphasis will be placed on health, good governance, education (which has worried a number of noble Lords), enterprise development and land and agricultural development for small farmers.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para72"></a>However, as the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, pointed out, it is not only aid but trade which is important. In the first nine months of last year, this country's trade to South Africa increased by 27 per cent. There we have an enormous engine for help and improvement, if it can be harnessed constructively and effectively.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para73"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thurlow, who, I suspect, has more direct knowledge and experience of things African than other noble Lords present in the Chamber, talked about its history and the part that South Africa has played in southern Africa. That was alluded to by a number of other noble Lords. As the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, pointed out, we have already seen the role that South Africa played in the recent Lesotho crisis to try to stabilise that part of southern Africa, which is to the advantage and benefit of us all.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para74"></a>We look towards the future. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark pointed out, the Church has played an enormous role in recent events in southern Africa. It is one which was undeniably contentious, but nonetheless historically and politically important.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para75"></a>It is often said that the Commonwealth does not really matter any more. Yet, in this instance, it is rejoining the Commonwealth which is the significant step for South Africa in the eyes of the outside world. The necessary preconditions were vital to the country itself; but as the sub-symbol of the change in its status, it is the rejoining of the Commonwealth which is so symbolically significant. It is for that reason that the British Government continue to value the Commonwealth as the embodiment of the special ties that we and other member states share.
<P>

<a name="50126-17_para76"></a>The Commonwealth has a continuing and serious role to play in strengthening good governance, and we shall continue to support that role wherever possible. There will be no lack of challenges for the Commonwealth in the years ahead, but the Commonwealth is, I believe, better placed now than in the recent past to tackle those challenges. The return of South Africa will strengthen the Commonwealth. I look forward to South Africa playing a full role. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="50126w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether any subsequent government of Israel has repudiated the statement of the then Prime Minister of that country (made on 7 April 1949 and reported in UN General Assembly Document A/838) that his government accepted without reservation an international r&#233;gime for, or international control of, the Holy Places in the city of Jerusalem, but could not accept the establishment of an international r&#233;gime for that city.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   We know of no such repudiation by an Israeli government. To the contrary: in 1950, the Knesset declared that Jerusalem was the country's capital, although Israel held only the western sector of the city. Government institutions were progressively transferred there. Following the 1967 war, Israel annexed the old, eastern and former Jordanian sector de facto. In 1980, Israel enacted its "Jerusalem law", formally proclaiming the united city to be its capital.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para0"></a>The UK is at one with the international community in rejecting all such claims. Our position has been repeatedly expressed in UN resolutions, in national statements and in company with our EU partners. We do not accept that commitments concerning the Holy Places alter, or are relevant to, the fact that Israel's efforts unilaterally to change the status of the city of Jerusalem contravene international law.

<A NAME="50126w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   The ad hoc group's main aim is to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention by drawing up measures to verify compliance with it. Since the purpose of the US Counterproliferation Initiative is to consider a defensive response to the threat from proliferation, it is not clear that this needs to be among the substantive issues which the group will address.

<A NAME="50126w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   Dame Elizabeth Anson made four main recommendations in her first report as Independent Monitor of entry clearance refusals which do not have a right of appeal.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para1"></a>First, that all applications and re-applications should be accepted and applicants should be told that they have a right to proceed, even where warned of likely failure. Instructions have been sent to Posts to implements this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para2"></a>Secondly, that Posts should be more consistent in their requirements for documentation before an entry clearance application is lodged or an applicant is interviewed. We are encouraging greater consistency between Posts.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para3"></a>Thirdly, that the refusal notice should not refer to confidential matters such as political asylum applications by UK sponsors or others, given that the notice may become a public document with an applicant's consent. Instructions have been sent to Posts to implement this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para4"></a>Finally, that writing should be legible on all documents on an applicant's file. Again, we are encouraging Posts to ensure this; Refusal Notices, especially, should be in typescript where possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are yet in a position to respond to consultation on the White Paper, The Civil Service, Continuity and Change and to the report of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee on The Role of the Civil Service.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  The Government are publishing today a Command Paper (Cm 2748), taking forward the policies on the Civil Service set out in last July's White Paper, The Civil Service: Continuity and Change (Cm 2627). The Command Paper incorporates the Government's response to the Fifth Report of the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee, The Role of the Civil Service, HC(1993&#150;94). It also takes account of other responses to the invitation to comment on the proposals in Continuity and Change. Comments were received from 50 individuals and organisations. Copies of the responses where confidentiality was not requested have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para5"></a>In Continuity and Change, the Government reaffirmed their commitment to the maintenance of a permanent Civil Service, based on the values of integrity, political impartiality, objectivity, selection and promotion on merit and accountability through Ministers to Parliament. This commitment has been widely welcomed&#151;and was equally emphasised by the Select Committee in its report. The Government also welcome the Select Committee's belief that "the commitment of the overwhelming majority of civil <P>


<a name="column_WA90"></a>

<B>26 Jan 1995 : Column WA90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>servants to the principle and practice of a politically impartial Civil Service is undiminished". The Command Paper announces further measures to underpin these values.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para6"></a>The Government have accepted the Select Committee's recommendation for a new Civil Service code to apply to all civil servants and summarising the constitutional framework within which civil servants work and the values they are expected to uphold. A draft code, suggesting the changes which the Government think necessary to the text proposed by the Select Committee, with an associated commentary, is published in the Command Paper as a basis for further consultation. The proposed code incorporates, as recommended by the Select Committee, a new independent line of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners in cases of alleged breaches of the code or issues of conscience which cannot be resolved through internal procedures.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para7"></a>The Government also intend to enhance the role of the Civil Service Commissioners as guardians of the principle of selection on merit. They will be responsible for the interpretation of the principles of fair and open competition on merit for all Civil Service recruitment. The Commissioners will be responsible for approving all appointments from outside the Civil Service to the new Senior Civil Service; and the next First Civil Service Commissioner is to be given a new role in monitoring senior internal appointments. Consequently he or she will not hold the post as a serving civil servant.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para8"></a>The Command Paper re-emphasises the Government's commitment to maintaining the Civil Service as a good employer, ensuring equality of opportunity, maintaining a predominantly career Civil Service, and to the training and development of all staff. It also confirms the Government's intention to proceed with other approaches set out in Continuity and Change to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Civil Service, including the delegation of pay and grading below senior levels to departments, and the introduction of Efficiency Plans in place of the centrally-driven Competing for Quality programme; to establish the proposed new Senior Civil Service; to carry out senior management reviews in all departments; to introduce new pay arrangements for the Senior Civil Service, including Permanent Secretaries; and to introduce contracts for all senior civil servants.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para9"></a>The Government are also publishing today detailed responses to the Review of Recruitment Responsibilities and the Review of Fast Stream Training which were published in parallel with Cm 2627. Copies of the responses have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="50126w01_para10"></a>The Command Paper charts a clear course for the Civil Service. The Government believe that Parliament, the public and particularly the Civil Service itself should be encouraged by the degree of agreement on the way forward, reflected in the very considerable sharing of views on key issues between the Government and the Select Committee, as well as by those who have given evidence to the Select Committee and have commented on the White Paper. There is a wide recognition of the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they accept the broad accuracy of the information contained in the EC Commission's Memorandum on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value (COM(94)6 Final) showing that the pay differential between men and women is significantly wider in the United Kingdom than in the great majority of the other member states of the European Union (apart from Ireland and Luxembourg); and if not, why not.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   Data in respect of the UK in the table on page 5 of the European Commission's Memorandum are misleading because they exclude women's earnings from the relatively more highly paid service sector, in which 50 per cent. of women in manual work and 85 per cent. of women in non-manual work are employed.
<P>

<a name="50126w02_para0"></a>The New Earnings Survey, published by the Employment Department, is the most reliable guide to the pay differential between men and women. In April 1994, the most recent date for which figures are available, women's average hourly earnings, excluding overtime, were 79.5 per cent. of men's. This is the highest ever figure. The pay differential has narrowed in six out of the last seven years. Since 1979, women's earnings have increased faster than men's.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What they consider to be the main causes of the continuing and substantial pay differentials between men and women in the United Kingdom, referred to in the EC Commission's Memorandum on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value (COM(94)6 Final).
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   Recent research for the Employment Department suggests that the main cause of the remaining pay differential between men and women is job segregation. Other factors include: levels of skill and experience; job characteristics; family commitments and a residual element of sex discrimination.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to introduce any legislative or administrative measures to reduce the continuing and substantial pay differential between men and women in the United Kingdom; and, if not, why not.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The pay differential between men and women is reducing, and has done so for six of the last seven years. It now stands at its lowest ever level. The Government believe that this welcome trend has been helped by policies which have created a sound economic framework in which enterprise is encouraged and individual initiative allowed to flourish.

<a name="50126w02_para1"></a>In addition, the Government have taken and will continue to take a range of measures which should help women's pay and employment prospects. These include: changes to the Equal Pay Act and Sex Discrimination Act; adoption of the National Curriculum; reforms to make the Careers Service more effective; a range of programmes run through Training and Enterprise Councils, and acceptance of recommendations of an independent Committee on Women in Science and Technology, which advised on ways in which the potential, skills and expertise of women could best be secured for the national advantage.

<A NAME="50126w02_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Brussels on 23 January.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food represented the UK at this meeting of the Agriculture Council. As he had signalled beforehand, my right honourable friend took the opportunity of this Council to explain the public concern about the transport of farm animals and the conditions in which calves are reared for veal in some member states. My right honourable friend stressed his determination to see that the law requiring freedom of trade is upheld. But my right honourable friend also emphasised the urgent need for the Community as a whole to recognise these concerns, which are being expressed widely, not just in the UK, and to take effective measures as soon as possible to improve the standards for the welfare of farm animals.
<P>

<a name="50126w02_para2"></a>I am glad to say that a considerable number of Council members agreed with British concerns. Five Ministers pointed out that, like the UK, they had already banned the use of veal crates. There was wide support for, and no dissent from, our proposal that the review of the directive, planned for 1997, that allows the use of this method should be brought forward. The Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Fischler, undertook to produce a report as soon as possible. All also agreed to make a determined effort to adopt rules on transport: this will be on the Council's agenda at its next meeting.
<P>

<a name="50126w02_para3"></a>The only other substantive debate was on the Commission's proposals for adjusting the support system for sugar. My right honourable friend regretted that the Commission had not seized the opportunity to propose more radical changes. My right honourable friend urged that, in so far as sugar quotas might have to be cut to keep within the GATT limits on subsidised exports, these cuts should be targeted on the surplus-producing member states. My right honourable friend also underlined the need to guarantee adequate supplies of raw sugar for the refining industry. The Council will return to these proposals at its next meeting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Gainford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their latest estimate of the cost of the Trident programme.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  The current estimate of the total project cost of the Trident programme is &#163;11,682 million, if all expenditure, including payments already made, are brought up to current prices and a common exchange rate of &#163;1=$1.48, as assumed in the long-term costing of the defence programme. If payments already made are expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred, the equivalent estimate is now &#163;9,770 million. Expenditure on the Trident programme to 31 October 1994 represented some 78 per cent. of the overall hybrid estimate.
<P>

<a name="50126w02_para5"></a>After allowing for the effects of inflation and exchange rate variations, the revised estimate of &#163;11,682 million represents a real cost reduction of &#163;211 million compared to that announced last year. The increase in cash terms is &#163;51 million. The reduction in real terms since the original 1982 Trident II estimate, including the savings resulting from the decision to have UK missiles processed in the United States facility at King's Bay, Georgia, now stands at some &#163;3.7 billion. The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom has increased from 70 per cent. to 71 per cent., reflecting the effects of the change in exchange rate, price base and volume changes in the year.
<P>

<a name="50126w02_para6"></a>I am pleased to confirm that HMS "Vanguard" entered operational service in December 1994, achieving the in-service date set when the decision to purchase Trident II was taken in 1982, and that the remainder of the Trident programme remains on schedule. As in previous years, we shall be sending to the Chairmen of the Public Accounts Committee and of the Select Committee on Defence a more detailed report on the programme. I am also placing a copy of this report in the Library of the House.

<P>
<UL>If the Secretary of State for the Environment intends to take design considerations into account when deciding whether or not to call in planning applications to be decided under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50126w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  Our general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. The Secretary of State for the Environment will therefore be very selective about calling applications to determine and will, in general, only take this step if planning issues of more than local importance are involved. Each case must be considered on its individual merits. An application for development which raises significant architectural and urban design issues is one example of the type of case which may be of more than local importance. Other examples include cases which, in the opinion of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, could have wide effects beyond their immediate locality, which give rise to substantial regional or national controversy which may conflict with national policy on important matters, and those where the interests of foreign governments may be involved.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
