<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether the progress made in establishing selective licensing areas for the licensing of private landlords matches their intentions at the time of the passing of the Housing Act 2004.</p>

<a name="08070172000017"></a><a name="80701-0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80701-0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08070172000292"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My Lords, the Government are satisfied with the progress that local authorities have made in establishing selective licensing schemes under the Housing Act 2004. As was expected, local authorities&#146; statutory duty to implement the mandatory licensing of certain houses in multiple occupation has taken precedence over discretionary licensing initiatives. To date, seven selective licensing schemes have been approved.</p>

I think that seven schemes have been approved in five local authorities, which in the three years since the legislation was passed does not seem very many. Does she appreciate that quite a number of local authorities would like to establish selective licensing schemes for private sector landlords in difficult areas of their districts but find that the government rules present insurmountable hurdles? Will the Government be more forthcoming about allowing local authorities to declare selective licensing areas?</p>

We targeted those areas because they tend to be where people are in the greatest housing distress, so we are not looking at the criteria at the moment. We never expected more than about 17 schemes, so to have seven in the first two years is creditable. However, because putting the licensing regime in place is a serious undertaking for local authorities, we must take great care to get the processes right.</p>

I have grave concerns about any scheme that is damaging to the amount of property that comes on to the market for people to occupy. Does the noble Baroness agree that whatever type of scheme is introduced should be fully justified and that a careful decision should be made as to whether it will be counterproductive and remove property from the letting market?</p>

Its share as a provider of all our homes has increased from 8 per cent to 12 per cent since 1988, so it is an important part of the market. The point about selective licensing is that landlords in certain areas are registered by the local authority in an attempt to help them to manage their tenants and properties better; essentially it is a management tool. There are great benefits for landlords in this because a scheme raises the tenor of and attitude towards the sector, but landlords have to be able to agree to it. However, the noble Baroness is right to say that we must be proportionate in how we use tools of this sort.</p>

Students are of terrific benefit to the local economy but, when they are concentrated together, there can also be problems for the private sector. Licensing would probably not be the answer, but we have commissioned ECOTEC to gather evidence on this to see what might work and what the extent of the problem is. We are working closely with universities and local authorities in such areas. We are looking at the accreditation of landlords and at neighbourhood management and we are consulting on the possibility of changing the use classes order to stop the proliferation of houses in multiple occupation. This is a very lively issue for us.</p>

However, the clear impression that I got when I looked at the CLG website yesterday was that this might well be another occasion of the Government putting down an awful lot of words on paper hoping that the words in themselves would solve the problems.</p>

We have a wonderful website and I am glad that she has found it. The point about the way in which we have done this is that we have prioritised mandatory licensing. As she will remember from the Housing Act 2004, it is in the larger houses&#151;those of three or more storeys with five or more people in the household&#151;that the greatest abuses occur. We anticipated that about 41,000 such houses would need to be licensed; we have actually licensed 25,000 of them in two years, which is excellent. That was the priority and selective licensing is a complementary tool.</p>

I beg the noble Lord&#146;s pardon; I should know east Lancashire well enough by now to know the difference between Pendle and Burnley. This is quite rightly an outstanding issue in Burnley, because some of the local landlords had a problem with the quality of evidence and the quality of the consultation. We are looking to make good progress on that now. It is important to know the local circumstances. In Salford, for example, 500 properties and more than 300 landlords are involved in the scheme. There has to be a lot of local knowledge and local consultation with residents and landlords before you can successfully introduce one of these schemes.</p>

At national level, activities include a service of celebration at Westminster Abbey and publication of a history of the NHS. NHS Live and the Health and Social Care Awards will also be focused around the anniversary.

Does he agree that prior to 1997 the chronic under-funding of the NHS led many people to question its survival as a universal service, free at the point of use?

When I delivered the BMA lecture in 1996 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the passage of the National Health Service Act, I said that in those 50 years I had lived through eight reorganisations of the NHS. In the past 12 years there have been 14. The Government now have the opportunity to consider in detail the interesting report that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has just published.

We are currently embarked on a review to update the handbook so that it provides the most up-to-date and timely information for forecasting passenger growth.

The evidence is that that is because of the high price of oil and people are turning from road to rail. Given that the Government&#146;s forecasts of passenger traffic are still based on $57 a barrel for oil and it is now over $140, is it not time that the new forecasts took into account the much higher price of oil that most people believe is likely to be with us for a long time?</p>

There is no real evidence so far. Road and rail journeys are not perfect substitutes and, in view of how commuter traffic works, individuals discouraged from driving their cars may not necessarily make the equivalent journey shift to rail. I recognise in part the statistics to which the noble Lord refers, but the latest quarterly edition of <I>N</I><I>ational </I><I>R</I><I>ail </I><I>T</I><I>rends</I> reported a 4.4 per cent increase in passenger kilometres and a 4.8 per cent increase in passenger journeys this quarter compared with 2006-07.</p>

Some 50 per cent of fares on the networks are regulated and some 80 per cent are either regulated or discounted. That may account for the fact that in the past 10 years we have had a 40 per cent increase in the number of passengers travelling on the network and we project a further 30 per cent growth in the next 10 years.

We are delighted that more people are using the rail network now than at any time since 1946 and that the numbers are rising every year. We are planning for that growth and investing in new capacity and the public are clearly responding. They are increasingly using the rail network and see it as a safe, comfortable and environmentally friendly way of travelling about our great nation.</p>

There are at present two high-profile cases where dissatisfaction is expressed by Muslim police officers. Disquiet is expressed also by their trade association. I have been told that 20 police forces were unable to send answers to questionnaires submitted by the association and a think tank. I remind your Lordships&#146; House of the figures for BME officers: there is one chief constable and there are eight members of ACPO out of 300 and 32 superintendents out of 1,600. Something is not quite right. Will the Government consider asking all the police forces to complete the questionnaire and undertake a review of diversity, promotion of BME officers and their appointment to specialist departments?</p>

It may not have achieved that exact percentage, but we are doing a huge number of things to make it happen and work. The Association of Muslim Police used a think tank, Demos, to send out questionnaires. The police were concerned about writing back to a think tank with details of Muslim officers in their forces, which I understand. Our officials are meeting the Association of Muslim Police this week to discuss that issue, and I know that the Home Secretary is keen to meet the association next week to talk it through, because it is important. The police service needs to reflect society, but&#151;my goodness&#151;we have a good story to tell.</p>

We have mechanisms in place for addressing these matters. As I have stated, the numbers are not absolutely right. For example, about 8 per cent of the Metropolitan Police is BME&#151;that is not enough. It is important that it reflects society. In New York, something like 45 per cent of the police force is made up of BME officers, which makes a huge difference on the streets. We have a number of mechanisms in place. During the past year, one in four police recruited came from a BME background. That is a huge change from three years ago. We have learnt our lessons and we are trying to do things. I do not think that another study or group looking into all of this would help. We need to concentrate on high-potential development schemes aimed at BME officers, the National Senior Careers Advisory Service and the positive action leadership programme.

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08070172000084"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Members of the House who were present in Committee and on Report will be aware that the emphasis of some amendments was on the position, fears and concerns of consumers and whether those concerns were addressed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08070172000085"></a>However, during Committee there was much discussion among trade unions about what some believed to be a lack of consideration of the workforce&#146;s views.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_134"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment No. 1, which is grouped with Amendment No. 11, to which I also wish to speak, deals with those concerns.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08070172000086"></a>During the Bill&#146;s passage there was much debate about ensuring that the new CQC has regard to users of health and social care services. There was support from all sides of the House for amendments to ensure that the new CQC must have regard to the views and experiences of people who use health and social care services and to their family and friends. My amendment would build on previous amendments to ensure that there is a similar reference in the Bill to the health and social care workforce. It aims to ensure that the CQC works closely with staff representatives and pays similar regard to their views and experience.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08070172000087"></a>As we debated, under certain conditions a deterioration of care in a care home may be more likely, for example, when there is a change of ownership, a change of registered manager or an unexplained increase in staff turnover. Often, staff in these situations have vital knowledge about when and how these circumstances are likely to arise. Their experience should play a role in developing the range of triggers for additional inspection of care homes. It is important that a way is found to harness this knowledge and to provide a way in which the CQC can regularly take on board the advice of staff in developing its methodology. Amendment No. 1 would add a consideration to the list of matters to which the commission must have regard: the views expressed by staff employed in activities to which the commission&#146;s functions relate, and of trade unions and professional organisations representing them.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08070172000088"></a>Amendment No. 11 to Schedule 1 would build on this by putting in place provisions to ensure that the views and experience of staff have a role in the centre of the commission&#146;s governance structures. Schedule 1 refers to the advisory committee that the CQC must appoint to provide advice and information to it. It specifies that the,</p>
<ul><a name="08070172000267"></a>&#147;advisory committee must include persons of a prescribed description&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000229"></a>However, this amendment would explicitly require that a member of the workforce sit on the committee. In Committee we debated ways of achieving this important role for users. It is also important to put in place a process by which the commission is required to take on board the experience of the workforce. Ensuring staff representation on this advisory committee would enable them to have a role in the development of the commission&#146;s methodology for inspection and review, which is appropriate to maximise public protection. Those working with staff employed in health and social care would greatly welcome assurances from the Government about the way the CQC will be expected to use the expertise of the workforce to ensure the highest level of public protection.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08070172000089"></a>I am well aware that the Government have had very little notice of this amendment and I recognise that my noble friend is in a somewhat difficult position in answering the issues that I raised. However, I would welcome any statement that she can make from the Dispatch Box to assure members of trade unions representing the workforce that their voice will be

In many ways, I wish that he had tabled them earlier in our proceedings, but I will do my best to be positive and to satisfy him. We want to ensure that the views of staff in organisations that provide or commission health and social care are properly represented in the new regulator.</p>

<a name="80701-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08070172000091"></a>We have discussed at length the importance of engaging and involving people who use services. I believe this is quite proper, given the concerns that the voice of the service user might otherwise not be heard. However, I would certainly not want to give the impression that the views of staff are not also important. We recognise the important contribution that staff in health and social care services make to the work of the Care Quality Commission. They are able to draw on their expert knowledge and experience and offer insight gained from working on the front line. Given that crucial insight and the importance of making sure that providers maintain proper working conditions, it has always been our intention for the Care Quality Commission to take account of the views of staff and their representative bodies.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08070172000092"></a>I am pleased to confirm on the public record that Clause 4(1)(a) already enables the commission to take into account those views as part of the regard it must have to views expressed by the public. I emphasise that this provision is sufficiently wide to include staff, and we would certainly expect the commission to engage with them as part of its overall responsibilities. I can also confirm that this provision would cover trade unions and professional organisations, as the commission must also have regard to views expressed on behalf of the public. I hope this clarifies the issues that my noble friend has raised.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08070172000093"></a>I would like to refer to several other provisions. Of particular relevance is our proposed registration requirement 17, which is about supporting workers to give people the care and treatment they need. The commission will need to engage with staff in assessing this and will be able to take action where this is not the case. We would also expect the commission, as CSCI currently does, to take into account the views of staff in gathering evidence to ensure that providers comply with all the registration requirements. Also, under Clause 24, the commission is required to consult on guidance as to compliance with requirements, and we would expect that to include providers and their staff. This is just one of a number of provisions in the Bill requiring consultation. I am sure that the commission will value staff input on many of these issues. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, will carefully consider the views expressed today.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08070172000094"></a>The importance that we place on engaging widely with everyone with an interest is exactly why we introduced the new requirement for an advisory committee. When establishing that committee, the commission will want to draw on a range of expertise from different sides. We have always been clear that we want the advisory

I expect that this will include people with front-line experience of delivering services.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08070172000095"></a>I would be cautious, however, about naming a particular group in the Bill, which Amendment No. 11 seeks to do, as this goes against the concept of an independent regulator. I am confident that we can trust the commission to determine who is appropriate. If needs be&#151;if the advisory committee were felt not to be providing the robust and representative sounding board we anticipate it should be&#151;a power is provided for the Secretary of State to prescribe the sort of people that it must include.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08070172000096"></a>As part of the wider picture, I refer noble Lords to the report launched yesterday by the Minister, my noble friend Lord Darzi, much of which is about engaging with staff about the changes they want to see to the NHS and empowering them to provide the highest quality of care. I hope that I have been able to reassure my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that the Bill as drafted meets the intention behind both these amendments, and that the Government are serious about empowering staff to help shape their workplaces. I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08070172000102"></a>Amendment No. 10 has been tabled in response to constructive debates in Grand Committee and on Report about how best to ensure that the commission maintains a balance in its work. I very much appreciate the attempts on all sides to find the most appropriate way of doing this. The commission will be held to account for the delivery of its main objectives and statutory functions, which we have clarified in the Bill, through the close scrutiny of this House. These include the tasks of regulating adult social care, continuing to take an overview of adult social care in England through its reviews and through the vital Mental Health Act role.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08070172000103"></a>The commission cannot fulfil its statutory responsibilities if it fails to dedicate sufficient priority of resources and attention to social care or mental health. We all agree that in bringing health, adult social care and mental health regulation together, it would be wrong to &#147;insulate them from change&#148; as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, put it. There has been some recognition that it therefore might not be appropriate  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to specify in primary legislation that there should be commissioners or sub-committees with specific remits. However, we recognise that it is important, to quote the noble Earl again,</p>
<ul><a name="08070172000268"></a>&#147;to ensure a fair balance of disciplines in direct alignment with the commission&#146;s key regulatory functions&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/6/08; col. 816.]</ul>
<a name="80701-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08070172000104"></a>As so many noble Lords have acknowledged, particularly in the later stages of the Bill, it is vital to secure proper representation whilst maintaining the flexibility for the commission itself to decide how best to deliver its statutory functions. In government Amendment No. 10 I hope we have arrived at a solution that we can all agree to. This is very much in the spirit of the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on Report. However, rather than concentrating expertise on the commission&#146;s review functions, it would require the Secretary of State, in appointing members of the commission, to ensure that they include people with experience and knowledge relating to the commission&#146;s key areas of business: health care, social care and monitoring the application of the Mental Health Act. Such knowledge and experience could, for example, include a person&#146;s involvement with relevant stakeholder groups who represent service users or carers, or perhaps their direct experience as a service user or carer themselves. I hope that noble Lords will agree that this amendment leaves no doubt as to the importance that we place on representing all aspects of the commission&#146;s remit at board level, whilst leaving flexibility for the commission to still organise itself how it sees fit and ensure that the organisation can adapt as the services it regulates develop over time.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08070172000105"></a>We have also tabled Amendment No. 2 in response to debates in Grand Committee and on Report, in this case about complaints. Clause 20(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08070172000240"></a>&#147;Regulations may impose in relation to regulated activities any requirements that the Secretary of State thinks fit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000230"></a>Moreover, we have set out that the proper handling of complaints is one of the key issues that those regulations may, in particular, include. Furthermore, our recent consultation, which closed on 17 June, made clear our intention that those regulations should include requirements about acting on and learning from complaints. However, I appreciate that noble Lords felt that the Bill could be more explicit on this point to reflect the importance that we attach to it. I am happy to be able to bring forward government Amendment No. 2, which, as I hope noble Lords will appreciate, aims to do just that.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08070172000106"></a>I want to refer to the letter that I sent yesterday, which many noble Lords may have seen, following my commitment on Report to make an announcement relating to the independent resolution of complaints by people who arrange and fund their own adult social care services. I am pleased to confirm that we will take the next available legislative opportunity to extend the remit of the Local Government Ombudsman so that he or she can investigate complaints by self-funders. I know that many noble Lords have expressed concerns about this issue. I therefore trust that this proposal, which is certain to make a real difference to people who arrange and fund their own care, has the support of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08070172000117"></a>CSCI sent out a briefing, which most noble Lords will have received, entitled,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08070172000243"></a>&#147;Health and Social Care Bill Third Reading, Tuesday 1 July. Briefing on the &#145;Today&#146; programme on CSCI and the new approach to inspections&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000231"></a>Members will recall that the BBC transmitted a programme making a number of allegations about conditions within the inspectorate, drawing on the statements of people within the inspectorate. Those statements have been challenged by CSCI. I asked Unison, one of the unions, for its response to CSCI&#146;s accusations against the unions, one of them being that they were aligned with the BBC in the formulation of the questions. CSCI&#146;s response, in my view, questions the integrity not only of the four unions involved but also of the BBC, which will no doubt wish to respond directly to CSCI.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08070172000118"></a>The &#147;Today&#148; programme report on this vital issue&#151;on the frequency of the ability of the inspectorate to carry out its work&#151;was based on more than 200 questionnaire returns. The questionnaire was written and paid for by the BBC. The unions had no input; they simply sent it to their members. The wording in the questionnaire was approved by the director of political research within the BBC, who is a well respected individual in Westminster. The focus of the questionnaire was on the impact of inspection and regulation changes on service users. It was not to do with internal industrial relations issues, which is what CSCI said in its briefing. The report mirrors many of the findings of an earlier survey conducted by the joint unions, based on 250 responses. These concerns are widespread and cannot be dismissed as comments of one or two people. Again, CSCI&#146;s report misrepresented the position in terms of the number of people who spoke to the BBC. The unions have been complaining since last year about the effects on service users of the new inspection methods. CSCI&#146;s own 2007 staff survey, which had 1,200 responses, had a different focus.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08070172000232"></a>Nevertheless, some results backed the view that there are problems within the inspectorate that should be investigated.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08070172000119"></a>I have not had time to check this data: this is what the unions told me this morning. In CSCI&#146;s own survey, only half the staff agreed that CSCI delivers a good quality of service to its customers; only 35 per cent agreed that CSCI could deliver what it has committed itself to; only 25 per cent had confidence in the senior management team; only 15 per cent agreed that change is well managed within CSCI; and only 15 per cent agreed that CSCI values its own employees. I have not seen the data, but that is what I have been told. I shall check the data myself if possible.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08070172000120"></a>The budget set by Government, and the Government&#146;s blanket approach to deregulation, have shaped the inspection regime. CSCI has responded to these pressures, rather than designing a system that meets the particular and unique circumstances of the care sector. In other words, what is happening is Treasury-driven, and I object.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08070172000121"></a>The claim that the new methodology had widespread public support does not stand up to scrutiny. CSCI commissioned a MORI poll of service users for its 2004 report, <I>When I Get Older. </I>It showed that 79 per cent  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of respondents said that services should be inspected at least twice a year and that more than a third wanted monthly inspections, yet under the current system, many services are inspected only once every three years. Moreover, respondents said the best way for inspectors to judge the quality of care was to speak privately to service users and spend time observing what goes on. These practices were rated much more highly than talking to owners or checking paperwork. Yet we now have a system that relies on a service review, which is a desk exercise based on provider self-assessment.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08070172000122"></a>Yesterday&#146;s CSCI briefing claims that its approach works, because two years ago there were 1,500 poor services, and now there are only 600. The concern of union members is that this reduction does not necessarily show that services are getting better; rather, it shows that CSCI is getting worse at identifying poor services.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08070172000123"></a>The claim is made that poor performers are inspected more often. This is doubtful. Under the new system, the default is twice a year for poor performers: the same as under the old system. The fundamental concern of union members is that the systems for assessing and monitoring providers are insufficiently robust. The frequency of inspection is determined by the service rating. The whole argument relies on being confident that a good or excellent rating, first, is justified, and, secondly, can be sustained for two or three years. It is this that concerns the members of the unions involved in these inspections. Poor or deteriorating services will slip through the net.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08070172000124"></a>The number of inspectors has dropped from 1,400 in 2004&#151;I emphasise this&#151;to just over 800 now. In addition to concerns about frequency of inspections, inspectors report that they do not have enough time to spend on each inspection visit. The pressure of meeting targets means that they no longer have time to follow up on concerns or issues. The CSCI briefing refers to evidence from a range of sources, including the provider self-assessment surveys. The unions say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08070172000244"></a>&#147;We have raised repeatedly with CSCI that inspectors are reporting that providers are not returning these and staffing shortages mean they are not always chased up in time. Even where they are provided, there are doubts about how objective and reliable the evidence is&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80701-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08070172000125"></a>A key feature of the new methodology was to have been a new IT system known as ICAP. Cuts in administrative staffing were made on the basis that the IT system would streamline systems. This was to have been introduced in 2007, yet it still has not been rolled out.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08070172000126"></a>There are some concerns about the overall rating methodology. A provider in breach of key standards, such as the safe administration of medicine, can still be rated as adequate. I do not know whether that is true but, if it is, I find that appalling. CSCI talked about unannounced inspections at any time&#151;indeed, there was much emphasis in Committee and on Report about the need for such inspections&#151;but it has to be asked how often they happen, given the staffing constraints. Furthermore, I emphasise that providers are tipped off about the scheduling of a key inspection by receiving the self-assessment questionnaire in advance.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In the view of people involved in the inspectorate, the annual service review is a desk exercise. The briefing claims that a change of manager or owner automatically triggers a fresh key inspection, but those involved question whether that is automatically the case.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08070172000127"></a>The last time we debated these issues, I said to my noble friend that those who had replied to the BBC questionnaire were lying, telling the truth or exaggerating. The more I hear, the more I think that there is an element of truth in what they are alleging. I cannot see how it is possible to leave on the record accusations of this gravity without Ministers wanting to know precisely what is happening within the organisation. We know that very often those who lead any organisation simply push the party line, although I do not mean that in a political sense. They push the case for the organisation, very often knowing that complaints are occurring but, because of all sorts of considerations&#151;relationships, budgets and whatever&#151;they simply peddle the same old tune.</p>

<a name="80701-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08070172000128"></a>I believe that there is something wrong within this organisation that should be addressed and that the department should send people in to find out whether there is any truth in these allegations. I hope that my noble friend will be able to deal with that specifically when she replies from the Dispatch Box. However, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, who I know is taking on a huge responsibility here, that many of these things will be left for her to sort out. I am confident that she will do so but she should have the benefit of knowing that people from outside have gone into the organisation and are able to provide her with information over and above that which may be fed up the line but which, by the time it gets to her office, may not altogether reflect the reality. I beg to move.</p>

I know that my noble friend Lady Young will be going into this in some detail and I hope that, when she does, she will consult other inspectorates involved in other activities in the public sector in addition to CSCI. She will have to balance the resource issue between the needs of the healthcare, mental health care and social care commissions, which will not be easy. I recognise all the points that have been raised. Having spoken to CSCI about this, I know that it has been concerned about the impact of resources on the time that it is able to spend on essential inspections. Cutting those short is almost as bad as not doing them at all, and I therefore entirely support the wording of this amendment. I hope that the Minister will recognise it as being desperately important when the new commission takes up its post.</p>

I cannot speak on behalf of CSCI, which is a statutory body led by its own board, and I do not want to comment particularly on the issues that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has raised about CSCI itself. I simply want to reflect on the issue from my background in regulation and from the five weeks&#146; experience I have had of looking at the future role of the Care Quality Commission.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80701-0004.htm"/>


<a name="80701-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08070172000132"></a>My view is that regulation is a wide, embracing and generic process. It is about drawing information from a whole variety of sources to allow a regulator to take a view about the performance of an individual institution and about its managers. It needs to draw from inspection as one source of evidence, but also from a whole variety of others&#151;including the views and verdicts of carers, families and, indeed, staff. My experience in the regulatory field is of one who shies very much away from minimum inspection frequencies because, over time, services and circumstances change and that mix of information, from a whole variety of sources, needs to be adjusted.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08070172000133"></a>The problem with minimum inspection frequencies as a statutory requirement is that they are, as your Lordships know well, quite difficult to change once in a statutory process, even if in statutory guidance. As a result, they are incredibly inflexible. In my previous regulatory roles, I have experienced circumstances where everyone knew that as a result of minimum inspection frequencies we were having to do things that were, frankly, crazy and a poor use of public resource. Yet we had no means of getting the appropriate regulatory change made to allow more flexibility. I really would not like to see the CQC in that position.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08070172000134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, aptly raised a recent report from the Commission for Social Care Inspection indicating that one of the best determinants of quality for a particular group of patients was, indeed, observation. Rather than a minimum inspection frequency, understanding how staff were relating to patients&#151;and how that institution encouraged that degree of inter-relationship&#151;was probably one of the best determinants of quality in that setting, which was the care for people with dementia. It would really be unfortunate, then, if the Care Quality Commission had an absolute requirement on minimum inspection frequencies and none on any of the other sources of information or regulatory models that it might feel best able to deploy, over the next few years, to produce the best outcome for users, patients, carers and their families.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08070172000135"></a>As one word of support for the current Commission for Social Care Inspection, I do not believe that it operates a desk-based exercise supplemented by self-assessment. It is working hard to develop models that are genuinely risk-based and proportionate, taking the best research evidence it can for the most effective set of information to find out about an institution and the care settings of individuals. I believe that we should be giving the CQC that sort of encouragement for the future, rather than setting minimum inspection standards.</p>

I believe that his heart is solidly behind ensuring the protection of vulnerable people, but I feel that I need to support the noble Baroness, Lady Young, in her endeavour not to find herself with a set of minimum standards that will make regulation very difficult.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08070172000137"></a>I just want to mention one group of people who have not been mentioned at all in this debate but who were mentioned a great deal by Members on the Benches opposite in a discussion on the previous Bill: the providers of those services, who have to deal with regulation. I spend quite a lot of time with providers and I am a provider myself; I declare an interest as the chair of Livability. I am immensely grateful that inspectors come in and do in-depth, all-round inspections, where they come to observe. There are some tick boxes&#151;I may have a bit of a difference of opinion about terminology with my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham&#151;but, all in all, the approach is very rounded.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08070172000138"></a>I do not doubt for a minute that not every inspection is perfect. Having worked in so many large organisations, I know how difficult it is. However, I also know that service providers who feel that they have worked immensely hard to get their service to a high level of provision find it difficult to be faced with the fact that here we are considering streamlining regulation on the benefits to the vulnerable elderly so that they get more attention. One criticism made in the BBC report was that an inspector said that they did not want a poor report because it meant more work. Indeed it does mean more work, because if you get a poor report, you get the inspectors back quite a lot until you improve. One of the positive things about CSCI is that, unless the service is dangerous, in which case it is closed immediately, the organisation works hard with the provider to bring services up to the appropriate level, because the alternative&#151;closure&#151;is disastrous for the vulnerable elderly. Anyone with a medical background will tell you that if you move the frail elderly or vulnerable severely disabled people, the likelihood of their death is increased. I have been faced with that option myself in the past.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08070172000139"></a>In thinking this through and thinking how we move forward, we should recognise that all of us&#151;I am absolutely with my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham in this&#151;want CSCI to have enough resources to carry out the inspections that it believes are needed, but not to be so stuck in a framework that it cannot manage that flexibly. We do not want really good providers being punished by what they may feel is overregulation because of those who do not provide the best service. I apologise for making my small intervention, despite having said that I would not speak.</p>

That is why we are emphasising the benefits of unplanned rather than routine inspection and of intelligent and proportionate regulation, as explained very well by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who, from her great experience, put the case for how robust regulation might take place.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08070172000142"></a>I wrote to my noble friend yesterday following up on our previous debate, including responses from the Commission for Social Care Inspection to the points that he raised. Again, I cannot emphasise enough the importance that we place on keeping providers on their toes. However, as I hope I made clear before, although it will not be necessary in most circumstances, Clause 61 already gives the Secretary of State the power to set the frequency of inspection in regulations, should that be required in particular circumstances. I feel like the referee who cannot take much action, in this case between the BBC, CSCI and the concerns expressed by my noble friend. However, if I can help in any way to clarify and reassure him about what has happened, I will be happy to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08070172000143"></a>On the point about CSCI getting worse, we have no evidence to suggest that its performance is changing for the worse or that standards are slipping, but I understand my noble friend&#146;s concerns and I undertake to follow this up further.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08070172000144"></a>I hope that my noble friend will appreciate that we are committed to establishing a proportionate regulator that focuses its attention where it is needed most to get the greatest safety and quality benefits for patients and service users. While drawing on the best experience of the current commissions, we intend to leave those vital inspection decisions to the discretion of the commission, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, indicated. It will be the commission&#146;s job to set specific frequencies if they are required, so I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08070172000146"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, has sought to reassure me. I wish her good luck in the task that she is to undertake. However, &#147;risk-based and proportionate&#148; inspection frightens me, because I know, as will other Members of the House, what that means. It means that some will get through that should be sorted out, but they will not be sorted out because they will slip through under that regime. However, if we are to proceed by introducing and using the reserve power to which my noble friend referred, then so be it.</p>

They run the risk of finding themselves removed from registers simply because they have ceased to practise. They cease to practise for many reasons: maternity leave; illness; the wish to follow a different career for a time; or simply that they are old enough to think about giving up active practice.

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08070172000152"></a>The General Dental Council considers it important that a list of non-practising dentists should have some public value rather than just private or personal value. I do not disagree, but the council underestimates the importance of knowing which trained professionals were practising as well as those who are still practising. All sorts of situations can arise. There could be an epidemic in an area, a pandemic could break out or a national emergency develop when it might be extremely useful to know where all those with skilled healthcare training could be contacted to give assistance. That can happen only if their details are retained on a register. People move house, sometimes to be closer to their families. The last dental register for retired dentists who wish to continue to be listed without continuing professional development and in a non-practising category was produced in 2004. Even by this year many of those details will be out of date. Who knows how much more time might go by before any call is made on these people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08070172000153"></a>I turn to the Good Samaritan issue, raised on Report by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. At the moment doctors can remain on a list, but that is now under threat. What would be the noble Lord&#146;s position if he were called on to save the life of a fellow Member of this House? Would it be a case of saying, &#147;No, I am sorry&#148;? That reminds me of the news story about the community support officer who was told not to dive in to save a drowning child. He said, &#147;I can&#146;t dive in the water to save that child who is drowning because health and safety prevents me from doing so&#148;. Good Samaritans are needed on many occasions; indeed, in France you have a duty to be a Good Samaritan, but if you are a Good Samaritan in this country you are likely to be sued if anything goes wrong. For that reason, people are a bit doubtful about offering help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08070172000154"></a>A third important issue is whether the various equivalent health defence and protection organisations are willing to protect people when they are no longer practising. People do not know whether their cover will continue. Also, why is it that healthcare professionals are disadvantaged and treated as second-class practitioners in comparison with solicitors and accountants? Their councils have no intention of dropping the lists of non-practising members. You can remain on the list as a solicitor or accountant until the day you die and you value that position. We should value it for professionals in the healthcare field.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08070172000155"></a>The Minister stated on 24 June that,</p>
<ul><a name="08070172000269"></a>&#147;the changes proposed in the amendment could be made through existing secondary legislation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000233"></a>It is important to have that confirmed clearly, certainly as it applies to the General Dental Council. I do not intend to repeat the arguments because they are all set out in <I>Hansard</I> and anyone who is interested can look them up. The president of the General Dental Council said in a letter that I quoted on Report that,</p>
<ul><a name="08070172000270"></a>&#147;there is no immediate prospect of a legislative opportunity being available&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000234"></a>On previous occasions, the Minister has kindly said that any of these medical councils would be knocking at an open door if they asked to have this amendment made, but I would like that point to be stated specifically  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so that I can be confident that it is true and that it will not be just written off. There are major changes ahead. I quote the Minister again. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08070172000252"></a>&#147;I should also mention that the White Paper on working groups on revalidation for all professionals will need to consider the wider issues around semi-retirement, retirement, career breaks and the ability of professionals to make use of or provide expert opinions to others&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/6/08; cols. 1381-84.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000235"></a>That is another important feature because non-practising people often still write in journals or lecture to other people. It is essential that there should be a differentiation between people who have been struck off the list for malpractice and those who have had an honourable career until whatever stage they decided not to continue. The amendment would cover that point.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08070172000156"></a>I look to the Minister to reassure me on this. I am one of those awful, pig-headed people who tend to divide the House over issues if they have to. I do not want to have to, so I hope that she will be able to give me the reassurances that I seek. I beg to move.</p>

I was persuaded on the first occasion that she spoke to it and I am equally persuaded now. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister that she accepts the argument put forward by my noble friend and that she will use her best endeavours to encourage the regulatory bodies to take up this idea, look with favour on it and, where possible, apply for the necessary Section 60 order, which I understand is the process that would be needed for those bodies which do not have a scheme of this kind.</p>

But this is a complicated issue which raises all kinds of problems. I was very surprised on Report to learn from her that the General Dental Council was not allowing retired dentists to remain on the register. Whereas for many years retired doctors have been entitled to remain on the register, the concern that I expressed on Report was because a legal opinion recently taken by the General Medical Council now suggests that retired doctors wishing to remain on the register must pay the annual retention fee from which they have been exempt since the age of 65. It is 21 years since I had to pay a much reduced registration fee for the General Medical Council.</p>

<a name="80701-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08070172000159"></a>Another problem is that next year the General Medical Council proposes to introduce a programme of revalidation which may, if the doctor succeeds in having his or her practice revalidated, lead to the establishment of a licence to practise which will be distinct from registration. It is a complicated issue which might make it difficult for an amendment of this nature to be enshrined in primary legislation. The idea suggested by the noble Baroness that the issues involved might well be dealt with by secondary legislation has many attractions. As the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said, doctors take pride in remaining on the register and dislike the thought, even in retirement, that they will no longer be registered medical practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08070172000160"></a>Legally, a doctor who is qualified and who has never been erased from the register for disciplinary or other reasons would be entitled in an emergency to give medical support even if they were no longer registered, but many doctors would feel embarrassed and reluctant to do so without being on the register because of the potential fear of medical/legal complications. It is crucial that a mechanism be introduced whereby retired doctors can remain on the register. I should like to see the same for dentists and the other healthcare professionals listed in the amendment.</p>

Would it not be in all our interests for all the professions mentioned to have a list of retired members and for it to be nationally held? In a national emergency it might be extremely useful to know where all the retired physiotherapists or pharmacists are. It is a sad thing if a group of professional people from all of these specialties are just discharged when they retire, as if they are of no more use to society. We clearly know that they are. I hope that there is some device whereby the royal colleges&#151;or whatever&#151;can make sure that these people remain on the register.</p>

I hope that the Minister can look at the issue, though I take the point made by my noble friend on primary legislation. I mentioned social workers when this issue was previously raised. Social workers do not have a right to appear on any of these lists because they are not defined as health professionals. Therefore, I hope that social workers will be considered too. Social workers can be members of the British Association of Social Workers, as I am, but their registration is completely separate. I am not registered at this moment&#151;I do not get on and do the forms, not because I have not done the practice days. That is a separate issue. If the Minister is looking at the list of health professionals, it might be worth a glance at the other people in social care who seem to be missing.</p>

<a name="08070172000167"></a><a name="80701-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80701-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08070172000378"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, has raised this issue in relation to dentists both in Committee and on Report. As I said in my response to those amendments, she knows that I am sympathetic to her view. As a result of the debate we had on Report, the noble Baroness has widened the scope of her original amendment to provide that the Secretary of State must make regulations giving powers to a health care regulator to establish a non-practising register with a reduced fee if the regulator requests it. It does not include any provision for social care regulators&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, is quite right on that.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08070172000168"></a>This amendment is an enabling provision. As I have said previously, we already have such a power to amend the law in Section 60 of the Health Act 1999. As the noble Baroness and my noble friend have asked, I shall put it clearly on the record again that we already have the powers to do everything the noble Baroness is asking for. We do not need another power to do this. Adding this amendment to the Bill would be duplicating what already exists. The noble Baroness knows this but is mounting a justified and effective campaign.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08070172000169"></a>As noble Lords know, Section 60 orders enable changes to be made to both primary and secondary legislation. Since 1999, these orders have become the usual means by which legislation relating to healthcare professions is made and amended. Indeed, your Lordships&#146; House has agreed 11 Section 60 orders since 1999. In other words, I do not understand the reservations that were expressed in the letter to the noble Baroness by the General Dental Council. Importantly, Section 60 orders provide safeguards, such as requiring consultation with the professions and the public and affirmative approval by Parliament, which the amendment does not contain. Given that we already have the power to change the way regulators deal with retired members of the professions, the debate we need to have now is not whether we need another enabling power but whether we need to use the existing powers to change the system.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08070172000170"></a>I understand that non-practising and retired dentists may want to keep in touch with their profession, especially&#151;as with the two noble dentists here today&#151;when it has been a fundamental part of their identity. There is a strong argument that those who consider themselves no longer in practice but who teach, lecture, write health-related articles or are on boards of governors or boards of companies where professional advice is required should be registered with the regulator. That model has been adopted by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08070172000171"></a>All those issues are being considered at the moment by two of the working groups that have been set up to help implement the White Paper, <I>Trust, Assurance and Safety</I>. Those groups include external experts such as the regulators themselves, professional representative groups such as the BMA, and patient and consumer organisations such as <I>Which?</I>. We are looking at the issues raised by revalidation and the new process by which all health professionals will have regularly to show that their professional skills are up to date. The way the registers are kept by the regulators may have

A large part of that will consist of looking at the implications of revalidation for people who may no longer treat patients but have an active professional role or are retired.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08070172000172"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, may also be assured to know that your Lordships&#146; House will be debating a Section 60 order to enable quick re-registration of appropriately qualified professionals in the event of a emergency&#151;for example, of retired doctors. I will be taking that order through the House on Thursday. I am happy to use my best endeavours to help the noble Baroness take forward this cause, and I have been discussing it with officials. Given the breadth of her amendment, it is legitimate that we now raise the whole issue with all the regulators. I will be happy to do so with her support, which I know she will give me.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08070172000173"></a>I hope that my response has indicated that we take the issue seriously and that the noble Baroness will be sufficiently encouraged to withdraw her amendment.</p>

These professions should look on that reply as being suitable encouragement to feel that we are not going to be overlooked. It may be too late for me in dentistry&#151;I am not worried about that&#151;but it is a much bigger issue than that, something that has become apparent in these debates. Revalidation is going to mean a dramatic change for all healthcare professionals. Whatever dividing lines there have been in the past, there will be much greater ones after revalidation comes in. There is a place for professionals to continue to be listed, and it may be desirable to have entirely separate lists for the validated ones and those who do not wish to continue practising. In fact, it is in the public interest to have them as entirely separate lists, which in the past has not been the case; doctors are still in their ordinary basic list. After revalidation, it will be better to have separate lists. The Minister has said that she will do her best to see that all the regulators looking into this and all the consultations about the White Paper will fully consider all these points.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08070172000175"></a>I speak as a dentist, but also to a certain extent as one of the many healthcare professionals.

Her response should be acknowledged by everyone as being very helpful and something that we can bring forward when those consultations and determinations are made. For that reason I thank her for all that she has done. Indeed, the whole House has been very patient as I have gone through this issue time after time. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08070172000179"></a>Section 164 of the National Health Service Act 2006 allows the Secretary of State to authorise any primary care trust or other person to exercise the functions of a determining authority when setting or varying remuneration for those providing NHS pharmaceutical services. There is corresponding provision in the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006. As it stands, the authorisation may be, but is not required to be, set out in regulations. Noble Lords tabled a number of amendments that sought to remove this discretion in respect of payment for the essential services that all pharmaceutical services provide.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08070172000180"></a>I fully appreciate the intention to ensure that we continue to support the vital role of community pharmacies. As noble Lords know, the Government have repeatedly given a commitment, both in public consultation and during the passage of the Bill, that the Secretary of State will continue to set the fees and allowances for the national elements of the community pharmacy contractual framework. However, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Finlay, put forward persuasive arguments as to why we should look at this again and we undertook to consider whether an amendment might be appropriate. I am therefore pleased to be able to put forward Amendment No. 5. The amendment will ensure that where the Secretary of State appoints someone to be the determining authority in respect of essential services, this must be done by regulations. That will apply to services provided under both Section 126 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and Section 80 of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006. Government Amendments Nos. 7 to 9, 13 and 14 are consequential to this change. I hope these amendments will provide noble Lords with the reassurance that they sought. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08070172000184"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I apologise for not being here to move this amendment on Report. Unfortunately I was in St Thomas&#146; Hospital with pneumonia&#151;just across the river, so near and yet so far. I thank the House for its generosity in allowing me to move this amendment on Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08070172000185"></a>The amendment proposes a practical solution to the intolerable injustice of being, as I am, almost a prisoner of one&#146;s local authority, unable to enjoy the same social and economic mobility and freedom of movement as our non-disabled counterparts. Once in receipt of a care package, we are to all intents and purposes required to remain in one place or risk losing the support we rely on to live if we move to another local authority. Those who do move often face agonising stress, hardship and uncertainty. It can take months and even years for the new local authority to decide what type and level of care package, if any, it will provide. Continuity of care is thrown to the wind.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08070172000186"></a>I shall explain how the amendment would resolve the situation and what it would mean in practice when someone in receipt of a care package moved to a new local authority. Their original authority must notify the receiving council and work with it to effect a seamless transition of an equivalent level of support. Crucially, the original authority would retain funding responsibility for a short time until the receiving authority took over the responsibility. The receiving authority would thus be paid to maintain an equivalent level of support for a period specified in regulations. In this way, a disabled or older person would have the statutory guarantee of continuity of support, enabling him or her to maximise opportunities for employment or a better family life.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08070172000187"></a>Noble Lords may think that continuity of care is already a statutory obligation under community care law. However, Luke Clements, one of the country&#146;s leading social care lawyers, argues that it is nearly always frustrated by bureaucratic delay and maladministration on the part of the receiving authority. He argues that the Government must urgently implement specific and corrective legislation, as provided by this amendment, to make continuity of social care support a reality.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08070172000188"></a>The view of the Equality and Human Rights Commission&#151;on which I serve as a commissioner as chair of the disability committee; I therefore declare an interest&#151;is very clear. In its opinion, the current situation could be open to challenge under the Disability Discrimination Act and the disability equality duty. Discontinuity of support negatively impacts on equality of opportunity for older and disabled people; for example, to move to take up employment or educational opportunities, as would their able-bodied counterparts.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08070172000189"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the Local Government Association has expressed concern that the amendment will put undue pressure on budgets and services. I can

No new demand for services will be created by the amendment. Against the costs to a receiving authority of taking over funding responsibility for someone must be offset a considerable range of savings, such as other service users leaving the authority, and ending unnecessary and costly bureaucratic reassessments.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08070172000190"></a>The LGA also questioned whether the amendment could tie the hands of a receiving local authority and be impractical by requiring it to provide exactly the same services to the new arrival. It has been reassured by the fact that the amendment refers to support services,</p>
<ul><a name="08070172000271"></a>&#147;of an equivalent type and quantity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070172000236"></a>It does not require the same care package. The receiving authority will have great flexibility in how underlying needs are met.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08070172000191"></a>RADAR, Scope, the British Institute of Human Rights, Age Concern, Carers UK, Mencap, the National Centre for Independent Living and Help the Aged are among the many other organisations which support the amendment and have been working towards it for years. Like me, they are not prepared to be told once again that a Green Paper consultation on this issue is needed. We have raised the issue during previous social care Green Paper consultations for more than a decade. Each time new social care legislation is introduced, we are told that it is not the right Bill. I believe that this is the right Bill, unless the Minister can give firm assurances that the provisions of this amendment will be very closely reflected in the Green Paper on adult social care and in subsequent legislation. This amendment will enhance the quality of care for older and disabled people at the same time as effectively creating a climate of fairness for all. Let us today pull down one of the most glaring remnant of the old Poor Law that puts disabled people at the mercy of their parish. We owe it to all British citizens to seize this opportunity. I beg to move.</p>

What an indictment of a local authority&#151;and of its association, the LGA&#151;to argue that it is justified in refusing to accept another authority&#146;s judgment of a disabled person&#146;s assessed needs. Disabled and older people do not move on a whim. It takes an enormous amount of organisation and effort. As we have heard, some people have no option but to move and throw themselves on the mercy of another authority. Is that authority then likely to decide in the end that the person has vastly different needs? What justification is there for the months of misery, cost and wastage that can currently take place while needs are being reassessed?</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08070172000193"></a>As a Labour Peer I am proud of my Government&#146;s commitment to independent living and the goal of equal lives for disabled people. So many policies have been put in place to improve our social and economic well-being. We have rightly invested thousands of pounds in schemes to help disabled people out of poverty, off benefit and into employment. Yet what greater disincentive can there be to prevent someone seeking employment which is just over the boundary of their authority than forcing them to take this gamble with their care needs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08070172000194"></a>The Minister is expected to say that this problem of portability will be dealt with in the forthcoming Green Paper on adult social care. I welcome that Green Paper, but it will be many years before that policy becomes everyday practice. In the mean time, let us give disabled and older people with support needs the freedom that they desperately need: the freedom to move to be closer to their family and friends; the freedom to get the education they need; and the freedom to apply for the job of their choosing wherever that may be. I urge noble Lords to support this amendment.</p>

For our society to allow disabled people to feel trapped in a local authority area, and to find themselves unable to take up employment opportunities elsewhere or to be near family, is simply unacceptable. It is equally unacceptable to subject disabled people who move to another area to the insecurity, worry and bureaucracy that almost inevitably ensues.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08070172000196"></a>I know that the Minister is sympathetic to the arguments that the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, has so ably put forward. However, I am aware that she is unlikely to be able to accept the amendment as it stands. What we need from her is a commitment that this problem will be sorted. I am not sure that a rather loose promise to place a set of proposals in a Green Paper is quite enough to allay the fears and worries of the disabled community. We need an undertaking that the Government will take this issue away and deal with it appropriately. If there is to be a proposal in a Green Paper, that part of the Green Paper should have very distinct white edges to it. I hope the Minister will be able to give us the reassurance that we seek.</p>

The question before us is one of principle. If people cannot move to be economically active or to be nearer relatives and other support, they are locked into dependency on the state, deteriorating health through demoralisation and thus increased social and health costs. The provision makes economic sense as well as being fundamental to equality of the right to work and the right to family life.</p>

<a name="80701-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08070172000198"></a>I fear the Minister will say that the issue will be addressed in a Green Paper and that that will solve the problem. It will not. We need to know exactly when the matter will be sorted out, which needs to be in the lifetime of this Parliament. The provision must address people of all ages, including children, and must be delivered through the legislation set out in the amendment. You cannot ask those with a disability and their families to settle for anything less or to wait any longer.</p>

It should have been discussed weeks ago because this matter is of such tremendous importance to the individuals concerned. It is a huge issue. All of us have only one life and if we are disabled we need enormous support to try to make it as normal as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08070172000200"></a>Social services departments up and down the country have varying provision for the disabled and the elderly. This is another example of our postcode lotteries. Where you live depends on all sorts of circumstances, but local authorities&#146; provision differs. As a former chair of social services in the London borough of Richmond, I know that if someone with a huge need, which can incur costs of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, moves into an authority&#146;s area, it can be very difficult financially to match the provision that that person received previously. This is a very serious issue, and with the best will in the world a social services department might want to match that provision but be unable to do so because it has a very small budget. Some local authorities will have a very low budget for social services due to their demography. The London borough of Richmond, where I was chair of social services, had a big budget because at that time we had the second highest proportion of people over the age of 85 after Worthing. We wore that badge with pride. However, provision can vary among authorities. Although I appreciate the need to sort this out, and clearly people&#146;s needs have to be met if they move to a different area, we must also understand local authorities&#146; problems in seeking to make that provision.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08070172000201"></a>I hope that the Minister will tell us that there is something in the pipeline, such as another discussion, a secondary regulation or a device whereby this matter can be addressed, thoroughly discussed and sorted out because it is a human rights issue for disabled and elderly people.</p>

The need for it is paramount. It is the most important amendment for disabled people that the Government can address. Labour Peers lean over backwards to make things easy for the Government because we support them, but on this occasion we feel a bit perplexed because they do not seem to accept the powerful case for this specific provision. We have had delay so often in this area. I have been involved in politics for 40 years and there has always been an excuse why Governments cannot do this or that. Although this Government have a marvellous record on disability and other things, they have failed to rise to the occasion on this matter. We have heard Labour and Conservative Peers put their cases. What are we waiting for? All sides&#151;Labour, Liberal and Conservative&#151;support the amendment.</p>

The compassion that would flow out of the amendment should not go to well heeled local authorities, but to poor, disabled and old people. So that advice was out of touch with reality. Noble Lords who have spoken on this, including the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and countless organisations support the amendment. Some 50, 60 or 70 of these organisations, which represent the blind, the paralysed and so on are unanimous in saying to the Government, &#147;Please let us have this amendment&#148;. These people are

They do not work in offices in Whitehall that are remote from reality. I hope that the Government will, for once, say, &#147;Okay, we will take this back and give a commitment, not in two years or in a Green Paper. We will face this now.

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08070172000204"></a>Although I am criticising the Government, I am aware that they have been kind to many disabled people and to me personally; but they are making a huge mistake if they fail to provide now for the measures in the amendment. I ask them to take this back and bring back a solution that will satisfy every disabled person in Britain.</p>

I am delighted that my noble friend Lady Campbell was well enough to return and put the amendment so movingly. I am a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission and vice-president of the Local Government Association, which is worried about extra costs and burdens. I honestly feel that if this amendment is seen to be necessary, the Government&#146;s role is to encourage local authorities to take it seriously and ensure that local authorities are given sufficient resources.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08070172000206"></a>It is important that we enable older people and disabled people who live in this country to feel that the system is fair to them. It cannot be fair if you are caught just because you want to move from one locality to another. Everything that is said about different levels of care and service provision in different parts of the country militates against that feeling of fairness. That is quite wrong. It would cost very little in real terms and would enable disabled and older people who need services, educational opportunities and a proper family life to move without feeling that they would be terribly disadvantaged by doing so.</p>

The amendment would stop a disabled person being in limbo while a new local authority assessed them yet again. This can take months, if not years.

I am only sorry that she was not here at Second Reading. I feel that this is more of a Second Reading than a Report debate. Therefore, I beg leave to say a few more words than I would normally say at Report. That does not mean that I will speak at length; I seldom do. I simply want to make a few points.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08070172000209"></a>A little while ago, we had a debate on the Floor of the House about disabled people&#146;s needs which should have been led by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. On that occasion, none of my friends with disabilities was able  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be present. All of them were suffering from the difficulties that occur when you have respiratory problems caused by a disability. That was why the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, was not able to put her amendment at that time and why it is important that we hear all the arguments today. In that debate I mentioned a campaign that I am involved with, Freedom to Live, run by Liveability, which has identified a wide range of difficulties that disabled people face simply because our systems do not allow them to move, not only geographically but between bureaucracies.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08070172000210"></a>If this amendment were pressed, however, I could not go through the Division Lobby with my good friend, and I will tell noble Lords why. This is the broader point. As the Local Government Association&#151;of which I, too, am a vice-president&#151;has pointed out, funding for these services has already outstripped supply. Its worries are about the implications for existing services. That seems an extremely serious position for the nation to be in. It is particularly serious as I have also read documents in which residential services are being encouraged to provide quality care while faced with a framework that pays the minimum wage to people who will not only care for some of the most vulnerable in our society, but give them the opportunities that we have. That is the perceptual difficulty, which I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and our other campaigning friends who have campaigned extremely actively, have made us understand. Being in a wheelchair and being disabled does not mean you are disabled in terms of what you can contribute to society overall. Despite that, I find it difficult to support this amendment because of the extraordinary complexity of the services that we need to look at.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08070172000211"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, and I did not table yet another amendment about the transfer of funding for residential care between one authority and another, but that is another aspect that needs to be looked at. I have a sheaf of papers from Ministers in replies to queries that I have raised about the problem of people moving from residential care into housing, from housing into supported housing and, possibly, back into residential care. It is impossible, if your disability improves or gets worse, to move between services. Never mind that; what about the benefits system? When you transfer from one place to another, benefits become even more complex.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08070172000212"></a>One area that has been hit on is assessment. People who move between one place and another have to undergo constant reassessment. The amount of person power that it takes to decide, for the third or fourth time, what the individual actually needs, is something that the Minister in the other place, at a meeting I was at recently, has undertaken to look at. I will ask the Minister, when we look forward to the Green Paper&#151;as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, these issues can be looked at even sooner&#151;for an assurance that someone will grasp the complexity of this issue. That person should be prepared to look at the detail, not put it into the &#147;too difficult&#148; box&#151;difficult as it is&#151;and come up with some real plans, so that people such as my noble friend Lady Campbell and many others I know like

Together&#151;that is, noble Lords and the Government&#151;we have created a much improved Bill to send back to the other place. In the parts where it has not been possible or practical, for various reasons, to include provisions in the Bill, we have sought to engage in constructive discussion and provide reassurance and explanation. While it is with deep regret that I cannot support this amendment, as it is currently drafted&#151;because it seeks to place a wholly new and rather fundamental provision in the Bill&#151;I seek, in the spirit that has applied to the rest of the Bill, to discuss how we can take this issue further. I have spoken to the Minister responsible for this area of policy and I am able to give noble Lords more positive information about continuity of care than I could in Grand Committee. I hope to convince noble Lords that the Government are determined to resolve the issue. A Green Paper with white edges, as was mentioned by the noble Earl, is the right way to express that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08070172000215"></a>First, I make it clear that the issue that lies beneath this amendment&#151;whether care and support services should be the same no matter where a person lives, as opposed to local authorities being able to respond to local needs and provide different kinds of services&#151;is a strong theme of the engagement activity that the Government are currently leading, in preparation for a Green Paper on the future system of care and support in this country. When looking at national standards versus local flexibility, the issue of transitional arrangements is fundamental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08070172000216"></a>The Government accept that there are great challenges within the care system and have signalled their intention for radical reform with the announcement of the Green Paper. They have, for the first time, launched a public engagement process which specifically asks people whether care and support in the future should be based on the principle of devolved control and local flexibility, or on a more national basis where a person will be entitled to the same support no matter where they live. That is at the heart of this issue.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08070172000217"></a>This question is explicit in our published discussion document, is on our website and is part of our current programme of engagement events. I can also confirm that the issue of portability, which the amendment raises, is being addressed as part of the debate on the Green Paper. This is a fundamental component of the   


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system that can be addressed only as part of a full review because of its implications for local and national accountability, democracy and control of budgets.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08070172000218"></a>The Green Paper will set out options for the future funding of care and support. I can confirm for the first time&#151;I am happy to do so on the record&#151;that these options will address the wider issue of local flexibility versus national standards, and the difficult problems that this presents to service users, as set out in the amendment. We will then hold a formal consultation on these options and decide, in the light of the responses, what the care and support system of the future will look like. I undertake to ensure that we pursue that with rigour and speed.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08070172000219"></a>Among other things, the Green Paper will be informed by the review of the eligibility criteria for fair access to care services that the Commission for Social Care Inspection is conducting for us. In January 2008, my honourable friend Ivan Lewis asked the commission, in the context of the Government&#146;s vision for adult social care, <I>Putting People First</I>, to undertake a review of the eligibility criteria, their application by local authorities with social services responsibilities and their impact on people. This followed a report from the commission that highlighted major inconsistencies in the way eligibility criteria were applied in different local authorities.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08070172000220"></a>The commission has been asked to submit its review by 15 September. After Ministers have received it, we expect the commission to make the review public. We cannot say at this stage what the commission will recommend, but the aim is clear: to achieve greater consistency in eligibility criteria across local authorities. This is another activity related to the wider issue raised by the amendment, and further evidence of the Government&#146;s willingness to tackle the issue as part of a coherent review of the whole system of eligibility for social care services.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08070172000221"></a>I turn briefly to the specific provisions of the amendment. It may be difficult to justify looking at these issues for people who recently moved out of a local authority without also considering those who have chosen to stay where they are. We should not tackle these far-reaching issues in a piecemeal fashion. Neither should we lightly dismiss the concerns expressed by local councils about this amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08070172000222"></a>There is no question that this issue must be looked at as part of a wider review of care and support services. However, I hope that the noble Baroness and other noble Lords who support this amendment will accept my assurance that the Government are not walking away; the issue is simply too far-reaching to address through an amendment to the Bill. The principles of the amendment may indeed be the future direction of social care provision. However, if that is the case, it is right that this should emerge from a review of the whole system, rather than from this single debate. Detailed negotiation and discussion with local government, and certainly time, would be required before changes were introduced.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08070172000223"></a>I have one further announcement that may provide reassurance. On 11 June, the Law Commission announced that it was to draw up plans for the reform of adult  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_161"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>social care law. This could result in the redrafting of current legislation. The aim would be to remove anomalies, contradictions and dated concepts. The review may also explore whether the current legal framework is in harmony with the Government&#146;s policy direction. I am sure that noble Lords will be pleased to hear that my honourable friend Ivan Lewis wrote to the Law Commission on 23 June and asked it to include, within the scope of its review, consideration of whether the current legal framework contributes to the difficulties that people face when they move from one local authority to another and are unable to find out in advance what package of community care services will be made available to them in the new area. Through this action, we will bring to bear on the problem the highly respected and independent view of the Law Commission, to complement the work that is going on in preparation for the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08070172000224"></a>Noble Lords will recognise that Ministers have tried extremely hard, throughout the debates that we have had in your Lordships&#146; House, to respond to concerns with positive action. We have taken every concern seriously; we take this concern extremely seriously. I assure noble Lords that I have taken it back to the department for careful thought on several occasions in the past few weeks. We have also brought forward amendments and made commitments on the record. We have clarified the role of social care within the Care Quality Commission; we have made it clear that the Human Rights Act extends to those who receive publicly arranged care in a private setting; we have addressed the issue of ordinary residence; and I have announced new proposals today. Wherever possible, we have sought to listen and respond constructively. However, I am afraid that we are not able to support this amendment. I hope that, with the reassurances that I have given, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I would mention them all by name, but I might run out of puff and I will save that for the Minister, whom I thank for her reply and her sincere endeavours to be helpful. I know that she is personally supportive of equality of opportunity for older and disabled people, and has great sympathy for this amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08070172000226"></a>It is a tough judgment call. On the one hand, my heart is heavy. I have heard how complicated this is and how we have to talk about it more and get to grips with it; yet I have been doing this for eight or nine years and feel that I have gone over the arguments ad nauseam. Therefore, it is difficult for me to see light at the end of the tunnel. However, today I feel that we have made some progress, even perhaps within the past hour. A combination of three announcements, some enthusiasm and clarity about going forward in a positive way and, frankly, sorting this matter out makes me feel that the journey could go in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08070172000227"></a>Naturally, I and others will follow this issue forensically as it progresses. However, I feel that we have a plan and that I may not now need to take the action that I

I feel that I will probably now be free to accept that job of a lifetime in Newcastle next year and that my care package will go with me because we will have sorted it all out.

I say that because I am fully aware that Clause 3 defines a level 3 qualification, and much of what I shall say concentrates on the generalities of qualifications.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08070178000024"></a>These amendments simply emphasise our belief that the Government should not be limited in their thinking about qualifications, both in terms of which qualifications count at which level and in highlighting the difference between knowledge-based and practically based qualifications. In her book, <I>Diminished Returns</I>, Alison Woolf says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08070178000061"></a>&#147;No one outside the education sector and the relevant parts of the Treasury talks about a level 2, 3 or 4 qualification&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="08070178000062"></a>&#147;When journalists have to explain the usage they generally refer to level 2 as the equivalent of 5 good GCSEs ... A* to C&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070178000047"></a>This, she says, is deceptive because other qualifications, such as the NVQ2 in food processing and cooking or the AQA level 2 certificate in enterprise and employability, are also level 2 qualifications but are not treated the same by employers and sixth-form gatekeepers.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08070178000025"></a>I am a great believer in parity of esteem for vocational and academic qualifications. However, we will not achieve that by pretending that a qualification is something that it is not. My honourable friend John Hayes MP was absolutely right when he said in another place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08070178000063"></a>&#147;It is the tragedy of the Government&#146;s unwillingness to accept the integrity of vocational learning, that, in their view, to have legitimacy the subjects must be academicised&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Education and Skills Bill Committee, 26/2/08; col. 703.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08070178000026"></a>To achieve the aim of maximising the level of attainment reached by every young person, we need to be honest about the type of qualification that they are working towards.

Furthermore, I simply cannot resist commenting on the story in yesterday&#146;s<I> Times</I> that pupils are rewarded for using expletives in their exams if the spelling was accurate and successfully conveyed a meaning. That hardly instils confidence in the system, and I wonder whether the Minister might comment on it because I cannot tell him how widely people are talking about it.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08070178000028"></a>The best way to ensure that vocational and academic qualifications achieve parity of esteem is to make certain that they lead to good jobs for which the young person has been fully trained, knows what they are doing and makes the most of it. That challenge must be met and should not be simply glossed over by saying that equality in qualifications has been reached, full stop. Our amendments on the Cambridge Pre-U and the IGCSE, on which there were long debates during proceedings on the previous Education Bill, simply flag up that there are now a number of qualifications being pursued by schools and universities and ensure that they will be recognised at the appropriate level. It seems bizarre that, among the hundreds of recognised vocational and academic qualifications, the QCA does not recognise the IGCSE&#151;a well-regarded and established qualification.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08070178000029"></a>Half of all independent schools in the country are now entering their pupils for the IGCSE: the Cambridge version is offered in 2,000 schools in 125 countries around the world. They are obviously impressed with it, which rather begs the question: &#147;Why isn&#146;t the QCA&#148;? The lack of recognition not only distorts results in league tables; we are in danger of opening up a two-tier system where 93 per cent of pupils educated in the state sector will not be able to study for that rigorous exam. As Nick Cowen, the author of a Civitas study, said,</p>
<ul><a name="08070178000064"></a>&#147;the result could be that pupils will soon find themselves competing for university here against European candidates with better British qualifications&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070178000048"></a>He went on to say that that was,</p>
<ul><a name="08070178000065"></a>&#147;one of the clearest indicators yet of a growing &#145;educational apartheid&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08070178000049"></a>in Britain.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08070178000030"></a>More absurdly, however, for the purposes of the Bill, pupils from the independent sector who take the IGCSE or the Cambridge Pre-U will not be considered to be in relevant education or training.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08070178000031"></a>Amendment No. 25 is intended to determine how much unfettered power Clause 3(3) is giving to the QCA by adding those words to that subsection. We would give the Secretary of State the final say on what functions may be conferred on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to maintain departmental control over what may be classed as level 3 qualifications. Ultimately, the Secretary of State needs to be the official who takes important decisions about educational policy, because he or she is accountable to the Government they serve and to Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

We agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, that it is extremely important that vocational qualifications should have equivalence:  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_165"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in fact, between them the QCA and the QAA accord a degree of equivalence between qualifications. This is no easy issue and, as the noble Baroness mentioned, the work done by Durham University in looking at the equivalence between different types of A-level has revealed differences, contrary to work done earlier by the QAA for Her Majesty&#146;s Government, in the relative difficulty between what are sometimes regarded as the hard science A-levels&#151;of physics, chemistry and, indeed, mathematics&#151;and some others. The Government need to begin to take this issue seriously and consider how best to accommodate it within the university entrance system.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08070178000033"></a>What worries me about introducing to the Bill mention of the Cambridge Pre-U, the IGCSE, and so forth is that they have their equivalents, but it will be very unfortunate if the divide between private and state education in this country is increased by the two sectors taking different types of examination. The more credence that we give to those alternative forms of examination, the more likely it is that the two sectors will separate. It is very important that we try to have a coherent set of school leaving examinations, if you like. From these Benches, we take the view that young people are required to go through too many tests and examinations. In the Finnish system, they stay at school until they are 18 and there is only one school leaving examination at 18. In some senses, that is a very sensible system.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08070178000034"></a>We agree with Amendment No. 24 on equivalent qualifications, but we have great reservations about introducing to the Bill acknowledgement of the Cambridge Pre-U or the IGCSE.</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="08070178000035"></a><a name="80701-0007.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80701-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08070178000075"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> Presumably, when the Government draw up regulations under Clause 2, they will have to accommodate examination systems worldwide, because pupils will be arriving in this country having gained all sorts of qualifications. They may have been abroad with their parents and been educated in the American system, they may have been to the Lyc&#233;e or the German school here and followed those courses of education. To deal with those oddities, there will have to be an equivalence for all sorts of examinations that do not fall naturally within the British examination system.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08070178000036"></a>I therefore very much hope that, whatever decisions the QCA may reach on the suitability of individual examinations, such as the IGCSE and the Cambridge Pre-U, for the state system, the Government will not seek to perpetuate the rather unfortunate collection of ruffled feathers in the Bill, which, to my mind, has a rather different purpose and where the QCA ought to be considering their equivalence because they are examinations that are widely taken, rather than in the light of any particular UK requirement.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08070178000037"></a>I hope that, over time, the noble Lord will manage to settle those ruffled feathers. It seems very odd that the IGCSE should be excluded and I hope that the Cambridge Pre-U is set to come within the system. I understand that discussions have been fruitful, or at least positive in that direction. To have a system where, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, says, we are running different educational systems between private and state merely because the state, out of some amour-propre,  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>refuses to recognise those qualifications, seems very unfortunate. If the IGCSE had just been welcomed into the fold as another way of doing GCSEs, no one would think that there was any difference. It would be just a question of what examination you took. The same applies to the Cambridge Pre-U and A-levels. It is a different board; it is a different way of doing it; it may suit different circumstances.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08070178000038"></a>By keeping those examinations outside the fold, the Government are creating an image of difference and an image that state system children are allowed only second-class qualifications. That is unfortunate in itself and especially unfortunate in view of the aspiration, which I share, that one should aim for vocational and other practical examinations being valued more than they are. Creating that sort of 1/4ber-class of academic examinations and giving them that added status by fighting shy of them goes very much against the Government&#146;s best interests.</p>

I promise to look into the issue and to return to the noble Baroness as soon as I have advice.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08070178000040"></a>We entirely agree with the intention behind Amendment No. 23, which is that there should be sufficient flexibility in the system to allow for any qualification that is at level 3 to count for the purposes of this part of the Bill. I am glad to be able to tell the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that the clause allows for this. Regulations under Clause 3(1) will enable the Government to list all level 3 qualifications that will count for the purpose of defining who is no longer required to participate. This also answers the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I can state categorically that it is our intention to list without exception all qualifications that are accredited by the QCA as level 3.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08070178000041"></a>On Amendment No. 25, I similarly reassure the noble Baroness that regulations made under Clause 3 will be laid by the Government and could confer functions on the QCA only if the Secretary of State approved.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08070178000042"></a>Amendment No. 24 in the name of the noble Baroness would define level 3 as the level of attainment demonstrated by the achievement of an A-level in two &#147;knowledge-based&#148; subjects. It is not clear to me precisely what she means by knowledge-based, and she did not seek to elucidate this in her opening remarks. If she wishes to give me examples of A-levels that are not knowledge-based, I will happily look into them and see whether any issue arises. However, I expect that my reply to any specific instances that she might wish to give me is that there is a perfectly satisfactory knowledge base behind the A-levels in question. In my experience, when the disciples of particular disciplines start to argue the rival merits of different bodies of knowledge, it is probably best for politicians to stand aside than to make value judgments, which I took the noble Baroness to be inviting me to do. I willingly stand aside from that debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08070178000043"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 231 would approve the IGCSE for funding and use in the maintained sector. The IGCSE is a reputable qualification, which  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_167"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some schools in this country clearly regard as beneficial to their students. However, it is right that we should have a process for accreditation to ensure standards. The Secretary of State already has the discretion to approve qualifications for use in maintained schools under Section 98 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, and we have published a set of principles for the use of this power. In effect, this means that there is a process for approving qualifications for use in the maintained sector, through which awarding bodies can choose to put their qualifications. To date, awarding bodies have chosen not to put the IGCSE through this process. However, Cambridge International Examinations has submitted some of the IGCSE specifications for accreditation using the title &#147;Cambridge Certificate&#148;. These are being considered by Ofqual, the new agency, at two levels&#151;level 1 and level 2&#151;which equate to the higher and lower tiers of the GSCE. There are approximately 16 subjects under consideration, including English, mathematics and science. If the noble Baroness watches this space, she may receive some positive news in due course. As I say, this is a matter for the accreditation authorities, but we do think it right that the proper processes are followed and we do not see a case for circumventing them for the IGCSE.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08070178000044"></a>Let me stress, also in response to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that the Government have no aversion whatever to diversity in qualifications where our advisers are of the view that those qualifications are of high quality and are consistent with the national curriculum. The IB, for example, is available in the state sector, and we have encouraged it considerably in recent years.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08070178000045"></a>The Pre-U, to which the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred, has now been accredited and approved for use in maintained schools and colleges. If IGCSEs are accredited, they will come under the definition of an accredited qualification in any case, without the need to specify them in the Bill. If this happens, my department will make a decision on whether to approve them for funding in maintained institutions under Section 96 in the usual way.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080701104000001"></a>Let me stress that independent schools are free to offer whatever qualifications they like, and young people taking IGCSEs or the Pre-U full time in independent schools will meet the terms of this legislation whether those qualifications are accredited or not. Specifically in respect of Clause 6, which is about part-time training undertaken alongside full-time employment, it is very unlikely that a young person will be doing IGCSEs or the Pre-U part time alongside employment, but if those qualifications are accredited, they would meet the requirements of the legislation.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080701104000002"></a>I turn now to the adult skills provisions. Paragraph 6 of new Schedule 1A to be inserted into the Learning and Skills Act 2000 provides a generic description of level 2 qualifications citing five good GCSEs as the example. Amendment No. 212 inserts the IGCSE into this description. We use GCSEs as the reference point for the generic description of level 2 qualifications because they provide a widely recognised standard of education which is easily understood by potential learners. This is not the case with the IGCSE, which is not so generally well known or available, and therefore we do not think it would be appropriate at this time to  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>include it in the legislation because it has not yet been accredited by the QCA. But as I have said, if accreditation does take place, the issue of its wider availability would then arise.</p>

<a name="80701-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="080701104000003"></a>Similarly, paragraph 7 of new Schedule 1A provides a generic description of level 3 qualifications. As with level 2 qualifications, we use a widely recognised generic standard as our example, in this case two A-levels. Amendment No. 213 would insert the Cambridge Assessment Pre-U qualification into this description. The addition does not help to provide clarity, not least because the Pre-U qualification, unlike A-levels, is not a generic qualification offered by numerous awarding bodies; it is a specific qualification from a particular organisation. So, without prejudice to the virtues of either the IGCSE or the Pre-U, it would not be appropriate to insert them into the Bill in this way. However, I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on the substance of their points about these two qualifications and how there is no discrimination against them in the Bill.</p>

The Government seem at last to have separated the business of accreditation from the question of whether a qualification should be funded for use in state schools, and that is very sensible. I would be delighted if the noble Lord was able to tell me, if not now then later, what timescale it is believed applies to the IGCSE. Are we likely to see it coming in this autumn or will it take longer than that? On the question I asked about overseas qualifications, children will arrive here with qualifications that are never going to be accredited in the UK system. We will have people who have gone through the French and German systems in our native schools because those curriculums are followed in some schools, but we will also have people coming in particularly with American qualifications who, while abroad with their parents, have been in American schools. Some mechanism is needed to establish whether the qualifications they hold are level 2 or level 3, so presumably that process can be gone through whether or not a qualification meets a particular set of criteria, and therefore it ought to be possible to bring in IGCSEs offered by, say, Edexcel which have not been submitted for accreditation under the net of, as it were, foreign qualifications. The purposes of this Bill will then not get too wrapped in accreditation which has been developed for other reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080701104000014"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 27. These amendments are designed to provoke and explore thoughts on what form appropriate full-time education and training might take. It must not be forgotten that non-formal learning can be supportive of and complementary to formal education. We should make sure that provisions in the Bill have regard to those programmes which do not necessarily lead to an accredited qualification but which can help young people to overcome issues related to their wider family and personal life that may have had a negative effect on their ability to engage in formal education.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080701104000015"></a>Non-formal education provides opportunities for volunteering and participation in youth work which can develop necessary and basic skills which had hitherto been lacking. For some young people who are currently failing in, and being failed by, the formal system, non-formal education may be more suitable. If they have already disengaged from the education system, this could be a way of re-engaging them and preventing them from disappearing from the system altogether. The important thing is not to ensure that everyone by the time they turn 18 has a piece of paper with a qualification written on it, but that they have picked up the skills they need to take control of their own lives.

They are both important amendments because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, mentioned, the Bill is targeted at the 10 per cent of school rejectors&#151;the NEETs about whom we spoke at length in Committee previously. Many of these young people drop out of school when they are 14 or 15 having failed to have been motivated by the school curriculum. Many have minimal literacy and numeracy and many have special educational needs which have not been picked up earlier within the school system or, if they have been picked up, have not received the help and support that they need. For many of these young people, the experience of school

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080701104000017"></a>It may be that the various reforms to the education system&#151;the personalised learning that we are introducing in primaries and at key stage 3 in secondaries, and the new diplomas&#151;will have the effect of motivating these young people and that the problem with which we are now concerned will largely disappear. But we all have doubts as to whether this will really happen and Amendment No. 28 provides for the kind of programme that would be suitable for these young people. As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, mentioned, basically they may be motivated by a work environment.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080701104000018"></a>The Bill envisages that each person will have a personal mentor and that the programme of education and training set for each would be personalised. In the hearings held in the other place before the full committee sessions commenced, Barnardo&#146;s, the Prince&#146;s Trust and Fairbridge, in their evidence, made it clear that intensive work with these young people can help to get them back into education and training but that it takes time. The other day we also heard moving testimony from the Rose Trust that young people with learning difficulties can hold down jobs, which gives them confidence and self-esteem. They learn a lot from such employment, but never enough to take accredited tests or qualifications because their learning disabilities are too great to do so. It is vital that there should be a place in the Bill which recognises this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080701104000019"></a>I was heartened by the letter sent to my honourable friend the Member of Parliament for Yeovil on 13 February&#151;I thank the Minister for circulating it &#151;where, in the second paragraph, Jim Knights, the Minister in the other place, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="080701104000164"></a>&#147;As I have said before, I do not believe that there should be groups of young people who are formally exempt from the duty to participate, and I have emphasised our belief that it is desirable for <I>all</I> young people to continue learning, wherever possible. We must put our efforts into developing suitable learning provision that is flexible and personalised enough, and providing the right support&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000154"></a>Our two amendments aim to do precisely that. Amendment No. 28 seeks that regulations must provide that the appropriate &#147;education or training&#148; referred to in Clause 2 can take place not only in a formal educational institution but also through voluntary service or in a work environment; that it is not required to be accredited and includes personalised support for non-educational needs. Amendment No. 31 adds the rider to the &#147;relevant training or education&#148; in Clause 6 that, where a course is not accredited, it is part of a personalised learning programme.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080701104000020"></a>Amendment No. 31 links up with two amendments we shall be discussing after Clause 10 relating to what a personalised learning programme might be and whether local authorities have the capacity to deliver such a programme. Both are important amendments and touch, to some extent, on the core of the Bill: how can we encourage back into education this 10 per cent of young people who have deserted or are deserting it? As we discussed on the previous occasion, if they are breaking the law by not attending school when they are under 16, why should we expect them to attend

This is knowledge-based in some cases as well, although I, too, think that is an interesting phrase.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080701104000022"></a>I endorse what has been said about the contribution of employers, many of whom take their responsibilities extremely seriously. Although their qualifications have not been necessarily accredited by the all-powerful Ofqual or the QCA in the past&#151;I declare an interest as having been on the advisory committee of QCA for some considerable time&#151;they are widely respected and recognised, often internationally as well as nationally. Some of the large multinational companies provide education which is of a higher standard than the more formal&#151;dare I say it?&#151;public examinations that we have in this country. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply and I trust that he will tell us the Government accept that.</p>

I, too, hope that this is part of the Government&#146;s thinking. Having listened to what has been said and having read the letter from Jim Knight&#151;to whom we are grateful for the detailed ideas&#151;it seems that all four amendments go entirely in the right direction. They will certainly enable far more young people in a disadvantaged state to participate and gain some qualifications which will help them on their way. Some of the stories are remarkable: disadvantaged young people who have completely rejected education so far and come away with no skills or basic qualifications, can suddenly be re-inspired to join the rest of us and go on to lead useful lives. We must do everything possible for them. &#147;Mentor&#148; is the right word here. It is absolutely crucial in situations like this that there is a mentoring scheme.</p>

One is the need to have great flexibility for the local authority to decide what particular pattern of education is appropriate to any individual young person. You cannot specify these things from the centre. You are dealing with individual difficulty, character and circumstance. There has to be flexibility within an overall responsibility to allow the form of education provided to fit the case.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080701104000025"></a>You are dealing, in a lot of circumstances, with people who are not at level 2. They are somewhere around level zero and have developed nothing but bad habits in the course of their education. They have ended up extremely averse to formal education and have great gaps and inadequacies in their knowledge. They have developed social habits which make them unemployable, like not turning up on time for anything or usage of language and methods of behaviour which would be likely to result in an early termination of

These things have to be dealt with in the course of the two years, if these young people are to become useful members of the workforce and society and to enjoy themselves as they should. These things are not dealt with by accredited courses.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080701104000026"></a>This business of accreditation has become a method of control&#151;I know things have changed&#151; and the QCA and related organisations control what should be taught and allowed. It comes back again to an issue I have raised previously. One of the difficulties in the Prison Service is that there are no level zero accredited programmes available for PSHE and related areas or all the work that goes on in the arts. You somehow have to graft a bit of literacy or numeracy onto your arts programme in order to get an accreditation to go with it.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080701104000027"></a>There seems to be a belief that you can take these people at the bottom&#151;they are absolutely flat on the floor&#151;and make them employable by giving them a GSCE. First you have to get them to take an interest in education. That will take an unaccredited course of some kind&#151;at least unaccredited under the present system. Accreditation in terms of putting academic hurdles into the qualifications should not be there. You are not trying to evaluate what these people have done, you are just trying to get them started. Secondly, a system which is so rigid and based on accreditation is never going to work in the sort of environment that particular young people want to be in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080701104000028"></a>There are all sorts of ways to get educated when you are that age. Experience comes in all kinds of forms. As my noble friend Lady Perry has said, a lot can be provided through an employer who is dedicated to looking after the young people in their charge. They are not going to want to leap through the hoops. How long is it taking a professional organisation like Cambridge Assessment to get one of their exams through? An employer will not go through that for their own in-house experience. There has to be some way in which following such a course is allowed. The right way to do that is surely to allow a local authority discretion. It should get to know what is available locally, what the results are when young people go through that course, and that should become an available option for them. If something is much bigger than that, or national, perhaps accreditation is appropriate. One way or another, we have to approach this with great flexibility and understanding, and not try to cram these young people into a framework devised essentially for the other 90 per cent, but not them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080701104000030"></a>We have to be careful not to see the 16 to 18 group as not joined on to the 11 to 16 group. There is a real danger that we are seeing two curricula. We talk about

All that has happened is that a summer holiday has gone by and they are six weeks older. The big difference is that they are not subject to the national curriculum once they are post-Year 11. That, potentially, gives the flexibility. Yet if things like this could really make a difference to this 10 per cent of most difficult young people between the ages of 16 and 18, why on earth not involve them at the ages of 13, 14, 15 or 16?</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080701104000031"></a>Secondly, I still have a great wish to see children and young people get accredited courses. If I were to choose a different word and say they need to get courses where their progress is recognised and recorded, would that more meet the needs? I hope that my noble friend will respond to those two points. What are the safeguards against us not having the mindset that looks to this variety of courses in Year 12 and Year 13 when we could have introduced them earlier on? Where is the continuity; how are we bridging the gap between those years when they are subject to the national curriculum and those when we have more flexibility? On the accredited courses, I would be sorry if we moved to a situation where young people did not leave this extended period of compulsory education with at least a recognition or record of the progress that had been made. I am not sure whether that is &#147;accredited&#148;. I would like my noble friend to respond to that.</p>

At the moment it is so rigid it has to be through Ofqual&#151;the QCA as was. Yet multinational companies like Microsoft, BP and British Aerospace offer a real gradient of qualifications which are not accredited by anybody but themselves. If a young person who has been through such a programme&#151;be it McDonalds&#146; well-graded system, Microsoft&#146;s or whoever&#151;and are looking for a job elsewhere, employers are going to be just as happy, if not more so, with that than with an &#147;educational&#148; qualification that has been through the tortuous processes of accreditation by Ofqual.</p>

Clause 4(1) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="080701104000165"></a>&#147;In this Part, &#145;appropriate full-time education or training&#146;, in relation to a person, means full-time education or training which is suitable for the person, having regard ... to the person&#146;s age, ability and aptitude, and ... to any learning difficulty which the person may have, and is provided at a school, at a college of further education, at an institution within the higher education sector&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000155"></a>and then, crucially, the two concluding words&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080701104000176"></a>&#147;or otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000156"></a>Those two words fully encompass appropriate full-time educational training that takes place at home or in the workplace.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080701104000036"></a>Amendment No. 28, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raises the important issue of non-formal education and training. We agree with her that appropriately tailored and personalised programmes of learning will be essential to engaging some of the young people who are hardest to reach. Some of those may not take place in formal educational institutions; they may happen, for example, at a centre run by one of the voluntary organisations mentioned by the noble Baroness, although some colleges and local authority providers have also developed excellent practice in providing flexible tailored learning programmes integrated with support. Young people may not find these more formal settings appropriate to their needs; where alternative providers are able to meet those needs better, they can do so under the Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080701104000037"></a>In Amendment No. 31, however, the noble Baroness seeks to allow for personalised learning programme-type provision for those in work undertaking part-time training. As I have just outlined, that type of provision may be the appropriate route for some young people and will be a valid way of participating in full-time education under Clause 4. It may also be a perfectly valid activity for those who are in work and need support to engage in training or education alongside it. However, it is our view that such programmes should not, for the purposes of the law, count towards the part-time training and education requirement under Clause 6 for that reason. It is important, in our view, that young people have the opportunity to acquire accredited training and qualifications that enable them to demonstrate what they have learnt to future employers, helping them to progress in work and to adapt to changes in the labour market.</p>

<a name="80701-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080701104000038"></a>Without a requirement for accreditation in respect of part-time educational training, there would be no guarantee of the quality or the quantity of the training undertaken in the workplace, and we would create a loophole whereby employers could provide very little training, or indeed none, under the guise of personalised learning programmes or suchlike. That is part of the issue raised by my noble friend Lady Morris, who wanted to see that people are making recognised progress in their learning beyond the age of 16.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080701104000039"></a>I am able to meet three of the four points raised. I am sorry I cannot meet the fourth, but it is for the reasons I have just given.</p>

Why does it have to go through these Ofqual hoops to be acceptable for the purposes of the Bill, when for the purposes of life afterwards there are all sorts of other things that will do just as well but happen not to be accredited? Can we not allow local authorities the flexibility to take on board, particularly at level zero, courses that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, says, give you a record of progress&#151;a certificate of completion, fine, but not an accredited qualification? Most of these courses will do that, because if someone has gone through the courses successfully they will want the badge. Something that gets them started again and on the road to education can be an enormously important part of doing right by the children at the bottom of the pile between the ages of 16 and 18, but it will never be accredited in the way that Ofqual means. If an employer is offering something, someone must say whether it is satisfactory, but that person surely should be the local authority, which is at the appropriate level to take that sort of view, while Ofqual is just too far away to ever look at it. To clamp everyone into the formalities of an accredited qualification does not do right by those at the bottom of the pile.</p>

As I said in our previous debates on this issue, accreditation does not apply to full-time courses, where providers, by definition, will overwhelmingly be colleges or established education providers&#151;provided that they can attract the funding from the local authority or the Learning and Skills Council, until local authorities take it over&#151;and can be the best judge of the courses that young people want to take up, responding to demand. We are dealing here with the specific and much more limited issue of part-time courses for people in work. As I have set out, our concern is that, without accreditation, anything might go in respect of training provided by employers; it could be low quality or indeed of no quality at all.</p>

He thinks that local authorities themselves should play the accreditation role. That is an issue for discussion. It is not a proposal I had heard before. We would be concerned about the capacity of local authorities to undertake that role, but I am happy to respond to him on that point when I have been able to consider it more fully. I would simply point out that that is effectively a different form of accreditation; it is not saying that there should be no accreditation.</p>

They build all sorts of inspectorates, which they run very successfully. I do not see that they cannot be trusted. Most of the time they will use formally accredited qualifications, but there will be times when something else is right for an individual. Under the Bill, local authorities are focusing on individuals because they are ultimately responsible for bringing prosecutions against individual young people. They will be very focused on individuals&#146; needs. I do not want to see them tied to offering only courses that are

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080701104000044"></a>The big providers such as FE colleges can offer any course they want. Will they get funded for them, though? Most of the funding mechanisms in FE rely on the qualification being accredited. It was a hard enough battle, when the system came in of funding A-levels according to points, to allow any space within the FE funding mechanism for all the extras that sixth-form colleges had traditionally offered students. Although some funding was kept, there was noticeable shrinkage at that stage, and there is little, if any, allowance for activities outside the strict curriculum for vocational qualifications. Enrichment does not seem to be part of the funding mechanism. If an FE college wants to offer level-zero qualifications to improve people&#146;s employability, sociability, management of money or any of the problems that young people present with, from where will it get the funding if the qualifications are not accredited?</p>

I was moved and interested the other day when we had a session with the Rose project, which works closely with further education colleges to place young people with considerable learning difficulties in jobs where they would acquire skills and self-esteem but would never be able to sit down and write an examination. I know the Government are introducing the foundation tier of qualifications, but the testimony we heard indicated that these young people would find it quite difficult to meet the requirements of those qualifications yet they were learning a great deal in these placements.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080701104000061"></a>The purpose of this group of amendments is to probe the meaning of the phrase &#147;guided learning&#148; and to have a debate about whether a young person&#146;s duty to participate could be fulfilled by learning and practising for part of the time away from their instructor, whatever skill they are studying, as long as that work was specified by the instructor. If the instructor gives homework or work to be done in the library or on a building site or in a hairdressing salon, surely it might be legitimate to count that as qualifying learning.</p>

<a name="80701-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="080701104000062"></a>I think there will be much confusion about what qualifies under Clauses 3 to 9. For example, is everyone going to have to add up the number of hours that they do throughout the year to know whether or not they qualify as participating? These amendments are designed to clarify the situation that might reasonably arise in the workplace so that we do not put the student outside the duties of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080701104000063"></a>I accept that all students will do homework, research, preparation&#151;call it what you will. However, we must remember that we are not dealing with PhD students or even undergraduates but 16 year-olds who are often very disaffected and might not have stayed on in education at all had they not been compelled to do so.

That might be very developing for them. Particularly where they are studying a practical skill, the tutor may deem it desirable to tell them to go away and practise by themselves without someone hanging over them. It might be better for their self-confidence to build up their skills in their own time where there is no one to see them fail, because many of the young people at whom the Bill is aimed fail over and over again. I want to make sure that the specification of what, where, when and how many hours they should study is not so tight as to eliminate the possibility of partly fulfilling the duty to participate by doing it by themselves where nobody can see them fail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080701104000064"></a>Every time we try a new skill, we fail the first time. This morning I coxed an eight on the river at Putney for the first time in my life and I did not do it perfectly. There was a bit of zigzagging going on. I am pleased to say that I did not hit anything, but I was very aware that there were eight men watching me fail. So I have sympathy with young people who are trying a skill for the first time and are perhaps a little bit self-conscious. It may help to build up their self-confidence if they are allowed to do some of the work somewhere else, as long as it is specified by the tutor and proof is given that it has been done. I beg to move.</p>

Individuals may spend valuable time adding to their knowledge and skills in a way which is not possible in formal or guided learning, yet the Bill would not take that into account. The amendment recognises that preparation and private study time are important. All elements of study and learning play their part in a successful outcome. However, the implication of &#147;guided learning&#148; is important, suggesting that the training in question should be directed and mentored. Surely that is what we all want from the Bill. Mentoring is crucial to the success of the schemes. The young people we are talking about will not necessarily benefit from being left to their own devices; they may need someone to guide them towards achieving their potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080701104000066"></a>Training should involve systematic training under a skilled mentor and should not end up simply as a work placement with the young person hanging around with nothing to do. Placing somebody in a workplace or training environment and leaving them to it is not the same as providing them with training or education. It is not enough to tick a box saying that another hour has been accounted for if nothing worth while takes place during it. A guided, mentored system is essential if we are to get anywhere with our aims. We hope that a balance can be struck in the Bill that recognises the importance of guidance but is not unimaginatively prescriptive about it.</p>

I am happy to be able to tell her that, unusually for legislation, it does mean what it says: it means learning hours that are guided by a teacher or instructor. The guidance can be provided online but it has to be genuine guidance. It cannot simply be the provision of a course without guidance being provided online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080701104000072"></a>Guided learning hours are currently assigned to all qualifications, providing an easy and objective way for young people, employers and local authorities to tell whether a young person is meeting the requirement. It is not our policy that private study time should count towards this requirement although, as noble Lords have said, private study will be a valuable component of any overall course. We do not wish to allow private study to count not least because it could enable employers to avoid releasing young people for any training at all by claiming that they are doing all their learning unsupervised at home in the evenings or outside the normal working day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080701104000073"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether everyone will bureaucratically have to add up their number of guided learning hours. The answer is no. That is the purpose of Clause 8(2), which makes reference to a course or courses leading to an accredited qualification which has or have been assigned enough guided learning hours. The student will be able to tell whether their course has enough guided learning hours on that basis; they will not have to count up the number of learning hours that they experience.</p>

Most people in the second year of the sixth form would have much less than 280 hours of anything that would qualify as guided in the very strict sense which the Minister meant. Much of what people do in their final year in school&#151;particularly if they are doing only three A-levels, as many young people are&#151;is guided private study in the sense that they have been told which books to read and where to go. I speak as one who comes from the humanities rather than the laboratory end of the scale and I know that a tremendous amount of real learning&#151;in fact, the best learning&#151;happens when one is in private study. I am appalled by the idea that it would not count.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080701104000075"></a>I taught for many years in American universities where one assumed that for every hour spent in the classroom there would be three hours of private study, leading to accreditation and credits. One did one&#146;s teaching and lecturing on the basis that the students would have at least three hours of private study time either before or after the lecture. I am shocked at the idea that properly structured private study time will not count. Rather than excluding private study time, we need a better definition of properly structured and guided private study time.</p>

We are perhaps straying into the area of wanting to clarify exactly what we mean by &#147;guided&#148;, not just &#147;guided learning&#148;. I understood the Minister to mean that if a tutor, lecturer or teacher asked a young person to go away and do or read something, it could be regarded as &#147;guided&#148;&#151;in which case private study, as long as it was sufficiently guided under the terms which the Minister used, could be regarded as &#147;guided learning&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="080701104000077"></a>The example of music students springs to mind. They may spend one or two hours a week with their teacher but they spend hundreds of hours a week practising. I suppose that if the tutor says, &#147;These are the scales you have to practise; these are the pieces that I would like you to learn&#148;, and the student does so, then that could be described as &#147;guided&#148;. But every hour that the student spends learning the instrument does not happen under the nose of the tutor, watched or assessed by him.</p>

I would not expect a student in the second year of three A-level courses to sit in front of teachers for 21 hours a week, which is what would be required. Two hundred and eighty hours a year is essentially the time it takes to do an A-level; that is the time allowance. Noble Lords mentioned accreditation and the hours that come with the course. My memory is that 280 hours is assigned as the guided learning time for an A-level. But a lot of that guidance in the second year is, &#147;Go away and do this&#148;. If that is what is meant by guidance then we would have far less of a problem with it than we would if it meant that they should be sitting in front of a tutor.</p>

<a name="80701-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080701104000081"></a>If you are using a computer-based learning programme, you will be sat down in front of it. The teacher will probably come back at the end of the period to review briefly what you have done and to pat you on the shoulder and say, &#147;Well done. We&#146;ll look at that next week&#148;, or, &#147;Would you like five minutes on this particular thing that is causing you difficulty?&#148;. The teacher interaction is performed essentially by the computer, and it is done extremely well especially in mathematics. There are also some very good language courses and no doubt similar ways of doing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080701104000082"></a>We are introducing computer-assisted learning to the Prison Service as the way in which prisoners will learn. Presumably there will be some pretty low-level courses taught through computers there, and it will not involve an interaction with teachers other than occasionally. What is happening is under guidance, because much of the guidance is provided by the programme. Much of the measurement and assessment is also provided by the programme. In a way, the teacher just supervises that. If that is guidance, we may be less worried about it than the idea that there should be a teacher, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says, sitting there looking over people&#146;s shoulders for seven hours a week. That is essentially what this provision requires, with a 40-week learning year, which I suspect is about what we would have. It is a question of what is meant by guidance. It affects the whole question of how this part of the Bill is understood.</p>

<a name="80701-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080701104000083"></a>When they get to university, many students will be lucky to have six hours a week in front of a teacher. Many get less, maybe four or five hours. In a 36-week university year&#151;and that is stretching it when you take out the time allocated to examinations&#151;there is far less than 280 hours of teaching taking place on a whole course, let alone for an individual examination. This concept of guidance needs filing down so that we understand what is meant. If the only way of establishing the number of hours is through what comes packaged with the course, we will come back to accreditation and the course having to go through some process that establishes the number of hours associated with it. Much of the education that I hope people will take under the Bill is not of that form.</p>

It has to be interpreted constructively. Something along the lines of &#147;under the supervision of&#148; rather than &#147;guidance&#148; is needed. If the cox only steered the boat for five minutes in every hour, we would be in trouble, but a teacher who has given instructions or uses a computer to help the student follow a course of instructions does not need to be there all the time. Indeed, they probably should not be there all the time. We should allow for that sort of flexibility in the way that we interpret this phrase.</p>

I still worry about somebody who might want to study a musical instrument between the ages of 16 and 18, rather than stay on in some other kind of course, because they would fall foul of this specification. I tentatively suggest that the Government&#146;s mistake is to specify a number of hours. Elsewhere, the Bill simply gives the number of hours required to provide an accredited course. I think that the word used is &#147;sufficient&#148;. Clearly, I will have to read this debate again and think carefully about whether I need to probe further.

This is crucial to the Bill. When we first heard about the Bill, the Secretary of State said that it would require at least one day a week, or the equivalent, of off-the-job education or training. That is why many of us were excited by, and welcomed, the Bill. Yet when one looks at its detail, one finds no reference to off-the-job education or training, nor any guarantee of one day a week or the equivalent. These amendments seek to rectify those omissions, and thus to implement the Secretary of State&#146;s original promise. This is not a minor issue; it is central to the character of the Bill. If this is to be a landmark Bill that reduces the huge educational inequalities in our country, it has to do more than simply improve the very specific skills of those affected by it. It must also raise their general ability to think about what they are doing, to analyse a problem and to communicate in writing. In a world in which specific skills rapidly become obsolete, it is these transferable skills that are important if we want to raise the educational level of the country&#146;s less educated people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080701104000089"></a>At present, many young people in Britain lack these skills. Interestingly, at the age of 15 our young people now do as well in literacy and numeracy as young people in France and Germany, but by the time they

The reason is absolutely simple; you only have to look at the descriptions of the education systems. In Germany and France, and many other countries, people go on developing their general skills between the ages of 16 and 19. In our country, many do not. To develop those general skills of thinking, analysing and writing requires a serious amount of off-the-job learning. Of course, it should be associated with the job; that is what motivates people when they are off the job, away from their work station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080701104000090"></a>Amendment No. 36 insists that, in the case of part-time education and training, the required number of guided learning hours take place away from the individual&#146;s work station. It may be on the employer&#146;s premises, around the corner; in many cases that is the best possible arrangement. It must be a place separate from where the individual does his job. It must be a place where he can concentrate on acquiring the underpinning knowledge, numeracy and literacy that develop through analysing problems. That is what the amendment proposes.</p>

That is the point which everybody concerned with education inequality has always stressed. We need the off-the-job element to develop transferable skills.

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080701104000092"></a>We should reconsider the enforcement issues that we touched on previously. Enforcement is important. How could we know whether 280 hours of guided learning was being undertaken if some of the learning that could count was on the job? Simply by looking at somebody who was working at his work station with his supervisor near by, how could we know whether he was getting guided learning? One cannot enforce the provision of guided learning hours on the job. It seems to me that if we want the landmark Bill which the Government want, we have to tighten up the definition of guided learning to mean that which is carried out off the job. I suspect that the Minister will refer to Clause 6, which states:</p>
<ul><a name="080701104000168"></a>&#147;&#145;relevant training or education&#146; means training or education towards an accredited qualification provided by a course or courses&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000157"></a>He may try to argue that that somehow makes it off the job. If it does, let us call it off the job. If it does not, you can easily see how some qualifications, for example an NVQ which could be studied entirely on the job, could be redesignated as courses. The meaning of words can be changed.

The 2005 survey found that apprentices were receiving five hours of off-the-job training a week. That is not too bad and is more or less in line with what we are talking about. However, an identical survey conducted in 2007 showed that this had fallen to three hours a week. That is an appalling situation and shows how efforts to develop the transferable skills of our workforce are being undermined. If the Minister wants to retain the education element of the Bill, he will have to accept Amendment No. 36, or something like it.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080701104000094"></a>Amendment No. 38 concerns the amount of education or training; that is, 280 hours of guided learning. However, Clause 8(2) contains a let-out because it states that the relevant person can be &#147;completing&#148; a course which would normally require those hours. I am not sure what &#147;completing&#148; means; it is a very peculiar word, but I assume that it means participation. Does this mean that you do not have to have 280 hours of guided learning; that you have to be involved in a designated course but do not have to do those hours? It is easy to see how a youngster could be signed up for a course that he finds so easy that he does not need to do all the hours that are normally assigned to it. What do we as education reformers think should happen? If a course is so easy that the relevant student can do it in less time than is allocated to it, he should do something more difficult or he should finish it off quickly and move on to something more difficult. This is about raising the population&#146;s education aspirations, not getting a quick fix.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080701104000095"></a>Many employers will approach the Bill in a spirit of devising what is the least they can get away with. When you read it&#151;I am sure that the Minister and his officials read it this way&#151;you should ask yourself how employers will try to get round its provisions. Many young people will also want to get round them. Tens of thousands of young people will collude with their employers to do the least that they can get away with rather than satisfy the Bill&#146;s spirit, which is to extend the part-time or full-time education leaving age to 18. That is what the Bill is about. Amendment No. 38 would close that let-out. I hope that the Minister can see the risks involved in Clause 8(2). I have been told that the aim of the clause is simply to allow for occasions when the relevant person fails to complete the 280 hours due to sickness. If that is the case, let us call a spade a spade and say that rather than have the remarkable form of words to which I referred.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080701104000096"></a>There is a lot at stake in both the issues raised in these amendments. We are looking to the Bill to set the parameters of the education system for the next quarter of a century. We should not be thinking about what we can get employers to accept next year. In fact, the Bill will not be fully enacted for seven years. We should be thinking reasonably ambitiously about an education system that is appropriate for this country for the next 25 years. I am sure that the Government want this to be a landmark Bill which will transform the life chances of at least a third of our young people, but it will not do that unless they make the changes which I have suggested. I beg to move.</p>

Clearly, none of us wants to let anybody off the hook as regards doing the right thing for young people and enabling them to learn in a way that is appropriate for their age and abilities and improving their employability in the long run. I am very keen on calling a spade a spade, but parliamentary draftsmen are not very expert at doing so in language which most of us understand. Therefore, the Minister may explain that these words are required to call a spade a spade in the terms in which a Bill needs to be written and do not provide excuses to allow people to get round what they ought to be doing.</p>

However, we certainly agree that it is highly desirable that young people are given every opportunity by their employers to improve their skills and expertise, and are entitled to time and input from them in order to do so. I shall listen to the Minister&#146;s reply before I fully make up my mind on whether I think the words suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, are needed to achieve his objective.</p>

They inject aspiration into this part of the legislation. Although it was said in an earlier debate that we were talking about the 10 per cent who are not engaged in education, training or employment, we are talking about a framework for everyone in an age group. This measure would particularly affect 16 to 18 year-olds who are in employment but are not receiving education as well. It is directed not just at those who have chosen not to engage but at those who have engaged for whom we should be getting a better deal.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080701104000100"></a>The amendments that we have discussed so far today have explored the parameters of education and training. We are trying to develop the concept of education and training further than we could in our Second Reading speeches. A lot of the earlier debates concerned accredited courses. I am very sympathetic to making progress, having accredited courses and gaining certificates. However, now we are talking about another very important element of education. If you are entitled to education, you need that time to reflect on your practice, which you cannot do unless you get some time away from it. That is just as important to me as having the right to follow a course that leads to accreditation or a certificate. Being away from the concentrated efforts of doing something and having time to reflect on your practice is education not training. I know that that was not always the case, having been head of a sixth form in a former life, but private study for sixth formers is an opportunity, if they take it, to reflect on what they have been doing in a more pressurised situation with teachers.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080701104000101"></a>I have sympathy with the amendments, because they provide time to reflect, evaluate, set your next targets and work out whether you have been tough or soft on yourself. Such an opportunity away from the work station, with a teacher providing guided time&#151;I am not in favour of non-guided time&#151;would be an

The yearly hours are stated in the Bill, but it would be important to know how they are spread out week by week. The noble Lord&#146;s statistic that apprenticeship time has fallen dramatically from five hours to three illustrates the problems that we will face. I am sure that the Minister can explain that the position is not what we might think and that it is all neatly taken care of, but we would like a little more explanation.</p>

I spent time in previous debates replying on issues related to concerns about excessive regulation by requiring 280 guided learning hours or courses that have been determined as equivalents to 280 hours&#151;as provided in Clause 8(2). We have also been criticised for requiring courses accompanying employment to be accredited. We have taken that step because we wish these courses to be genuine and we want the 280 hours to be for real.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080701104000104"></a>However, my noble friend wants us to go further and to specify that the guided learning undertaken by young people in full-time work should always be away from their workstation. We are trying to hold a credible middle ground between those two positions. It is not because of an oversight that we have not specified in the Bill that guided learning must be undertaken away from the workstation. My noble friend knows better than anyone what the intentions are behind our legislation, since there is no one more assiduous in engaging with us on the plans as we draw them up. I think that my noble friend has met every Minister in the DCSF concerned with these issues apart from me; and I know that a meeting will be forthcoming after the reply I shall give him. He knows it is our policy that there should be flexibility in this regard. It is not our policy that learning should always&#151;I stress, always&#151;be away from the young person&#146;s workstation. Of course, many young people will be released by their employer to undertake training somewhere else, such as a college, so all of their learning will necessarily be away from their workstation. Other young people will receive part-time training provided by their employer, perhaps at a private training provider, mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, but perhaps in their workplace also. It is appropriate that there should be that flexibility for training to be provided in those ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080701104000105"></a>One of the principles behind the changes that we are making to the 14 to 19 curriculum and qualifications is that learning should be personalised and delivered in a way that engages the young person and suits their individual needs and interests. That theme has been raised repeatedly in our debates. Some young people learn best when they can see the immediate practical relevance and application of what they are learning, so  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it would not be right to specify in the Bill that for all young people learning must be away from their workstation, as my noble friend would wish.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080701104000106"></a>However, we absolutely agree with him that the learning that young people undertake must be of high quality, that it must be actual, guided learning, and that young people must be learning new things, not simply doing their day-to-day jobs. That is why we were not sympathetic to earlier amendments under which informal, unaccredited, in-house training should count towards the 280 guided-learning hours requirement of Clause 8, or that simply being employed without training should count.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080701104000107"></a>I hesitate to raise my next point, but I will do so and thereby guarantee a meeting with my noble friend afterwards. I am advised that recent research is equivocal on the benefits of training away from the workplace in all cases. A long research paper by researchers who are familiar to my noble friend&#151;Andrew Jenkins, Charley Greenwood and Anna Vignoles&#151;was published in September 2007 by the Centre for the Economics of Education, which has a relationship with the LSE: <I>The Returns to Qualifications in England: Updating the Evidence Base on Level 2 and Level 3 Vocational Qualifications</I>. The research concluded that for men, the wage returns to level 2 vocational qualifications are in fact strongest when those qualifications are acquired in work, as opposed to in college or other settings, which suggested that in those cases learning on the job can be the most effective way of learning. That was described on page 40 of the research paper, which I have here and will give to my noble friend afterwards, because I know that he will wish to engage with us more fully. That gives further support to our contention that there should be flexibility in how learning is provided and we should not impose a rigid straitjacket by saying that in all cases the part-time education or training should be away from the workplace.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080701104000108"></a>I stress again that it is not sufficient for on-the-job training and education simply to comprise skill-accreditation NVQs. Clause 6(1) explicitly states that young people must be doing &#147;a course or courses&#148;, which means a series of classes or lessons on a particular subject. It is not a question of simply being signed up for a qualification that can be achieved without any additional learning. A course must be involved.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080701104000109"></a>I hope that I have gone some way to reassure my noble friend of the seriousness with which we take the requirement that accredited courses should comprise the learning component of part-time education and training, although I fear that we cannot go the whole way with him and require that all such courses be provided away from the workstation.</p>

I have a few reactions. It would be helpful for there to be a definition of &#147;a course&#148; in the Bill, otherwise someone else, outside the Bill, can change the definition of a course. That is one obvious point. As regards the time, I have never said that all the guided learning should be off the job; all I was saying was that there should be a minimum amount. It goes without saying that a lot of guided learning should be on the job, but it is impossible to imagine any outside authority being able to or wanting to

You may be able to monitor the progress, but that is not part of this Bill. This Bill is about&#151;and we should be clear about this&#151;participation in education and training, not about an obligation on somebody to achieve a qualification, because you cannot have such a thing.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080701104000158"></a>I was keen to stress the difference between away from the workstation and away from the place of employment. It is very desirable that things happen on the employer&#146;s premises. It makes for the best possible integration, where the off-the-job element is happening as well as the on-the-job element&#151;both on the employer&#146;s premises, but not in the same room. One has to be careful about that distinction. I am wondering whether the Minister could get at the presumption that there is a minimum of off-the-job learning. This could be driven through with a cart and horses unless, somehow, there is a presumption that there is an off-the-job minimum or a tight definition of the person&#146;s course, which ensures a quite substantial off-the-job minimum element. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The greater part of the extra education induced by the Bill will be the part-time education or training, which is why we are spending so much time discussing it. That is aimed at people who presently do not get it. The amendment seeks to ensure that the  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_189"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>annual funding, per person, obtained by the under-privileged group who are brought into education and training through the Bill is at least as good as the annual funding, per person, given to the more privileged people who go down the full-time route, most of whom, or their equivalent, are already going down it.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080701104000119"></a>There are two arguments for the amendment, each in itself sufficient to justify it. The first is a practical one, the second a matter of principle and social justice. I shall start with the practical argument. There is really only one major problem with implementing the Bill&#151;finding enough employer places to enable young people who do not want full-time education to have a part-time education. That is the only practical problem. If that can be satisfied, the problems of enforcement will not be a big deal because people on the whole will be quite happy to have a job with a wage. I estimate that the number of additional places, with training, to be provided by employers is of the order of a quarter of a million. This is a very serious challenge even though we have got some time. Unless we can find those places, the Bill means that we are forcing young people into full-time education who do not want it, which is a pretty explosive thing to be doing.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080701104000120"></a>How are we going to find these places? It is quite clear that we will not find them unless we have a financial inducement that can be paid to employers who take on young people in a training capacity&#151;like the payments made in many countries to employers who take on apprentices. Such payments would be entirely reasonable. I shall give a few broad facts. At present, a training provider who provides a modern apprenticeship&#151;not normally the employer&#151;is usually paid about the same amount as an FE college providing a full-time education to someone of the same age. So, there is parity, if you like, on the tuition payments. However, students in full-time education also attract EMAs, child tax credits and child benefit. That adds up to approximately &#163;1.5 billion. If a student is in an apprenticeship, he does not need an EMA, a child tax credit or child benefit because he is getting a wage. However, he does need a place.</p>

<a name="80701-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080701104000121"></a>The main problem with the Bill concerns the finding of places that will give opportunities to young people. Therefore, it seems eminently reasonable to use money to provide employers with places for young people to get a part-time education, just as it is reasonable to provide EMAs to induce young people to take full-time education. These are both parallel and complementary policies for securing extra educational enrolments. That is the practical argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080701104000122"></a>The second argument is one of social justice. If you consider most young people who are in full-time education beyond the age of 16, the great majority will get something like five years of post-16 education, including university, at major expense to the state in all of those years. Now, if you consider the people affected by this Bill, most of them get little beyond 16. As a result of the Bill, they will get an extra two years of education, but for most of them, probably not much more than that. The people we are bringing into education here are going to get two years compared to the five years of people going down the full-time route. How could we possibly justify a situation where the people going  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_190"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>down the part-time route for that short period are getting less per year than those going down the full-time route for that longer period? However, that is what is going to happen, as sure as eggs is eggs, unless we do something about it. Therefore, there is a big social justice argument connected with the Bill. If we are going to corral these people into education, we should give them as good a deal as we are giving to the full-time people who will get so much more out of the system beyond the age of 16. We absolutely have to do that.</p>

<a name="80701-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080701104000123"></a>The amendment is necessary for two reasons. First, it is necessary to ensure that the Bill can work. Unless we can show how we can get the places, we should not pass such a Bill. Secondly, it is necessary as a matter of simple justice. I earnestly hope that my noble friend can find some way of including this principle within the Bill. I know that constitutional issues are involved. However, from the Government&#146;s point of view, a Bill that gives no indication of how it could possibly be made to work and no guarantee of fairness to the group who are being forced into compulsory education is not the right way of going forward. I beg to move.</p>

His point is a potent one. Those who enter into the part-time apprenticeship form of education, or go into education but have a part-time job, are those who lose out. One difficulty we face, as he rightly pointed out, is that while apprenticeships are probably the best way for these people to acquire education and training&#151;because they are well-motivated when they are in a job and are motivated by that job&#151;we nevertheless have a surplus of applicants for apprenticeships at present. Not enough companies offer apprenticeships. If you ask them, &#147;Why are you not putting forward an apprenticeship?&#148;, they constantly raise the problems of cost, bureaucracy and so on. I refer the noble Lord to the report last year on apprenticeships by the Select Committee on Economic Affairs. It pointed out how very satisfactory a lot of apprenticeships are. Nevertheless, there is quite a strong case for giving a subsidy to employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080701104000125"></a>I point out to the noble Lord an anomaly that he has not mentioned; that is, under the train-to-gain scheme, which admittedly applies to current employees of a company, the company gets paid for employees training for a level 2 qualification but if it takes on an apprentice aged 16 or 17 to do a level 2 qualification, there is no subsidy for the company. In fact, it has to pay the apprentice&#146;s wages and 50 per cent of his fees at the further education college for off-the-job training. There are positive cost disincentives to take on apprentices and a positive incentive for companies to take on people with no training whatever and put them through training subsequently through the train-to-gain scheme. This is totally absurd. The Government need to consider aligning the train-to-gain scheme with apprenticeship qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080701104000128"></a>I listened only a few days ago to an employer who was providing apprenticeships at a fairly basic level and was doing very well but was complaining because, as soon as the young person on an apprenticeship had gained a qualification, experience and confidence, they were usually stolen by another employer. That trainer felt not that the money was wasted&#151;they were doing it partly to help the individual&#151;but very much out of pocket. It is only fair that this amendment is taken very seriously indeed. I am certain that the noble Lord, Lord Layard, will have got his facts more than verified and more than right.</p>

I absolutely take the point that employers need some inducement to provide these places, which are desperately needed, and that that inducement could be financial. However, I cannot work out from his amendment&#151;I am probably just being slow&#151;quite how it would work. First, the provider of education under the new scheme will provide it, if he is an employer, part-time; the provider of education referred to in subsection (1) of the amendment would provide it &#147;full-time&#148;. Is there an element of pro rata here? If someone is working, as it were, for two-thirds of the time, over a year, is that equated to an equivalent number of school days below the age of 16, or does it relate to a number of college days if further education is involved? Secondly, I cannot work out what proportion is intended to go to the employer. I think I understand what the noble Lord intends but it seems that it is split in subsection (2)(b) between employers and some others who are, presumably, the people with the workstation, as it were, as opposed to the people with the hands-on job. To help me in this and to shorten what I say, could the noble Lord tell us what he thinks the quantum of the benefit to the employer in a typical case would be, and how many employees would amount to a row of beans when it came to a big employer?</p>

As emerged from our earlier discussions, the teaching side of part-time courses can be quite intensive. Many vocational courses are also more expensive than college-based courses. On top of that, there are problems evaluating an NVQ. That is why, as of now, expenditure on a modern apprentice, which is paid to a training provider&#151;typically, a training company&#151;and the work that they do with the apprentice, including finding him an employer, is the same as the amount that is given to an FE college for a full-time student at that college. There is that parity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080701104000131"></a>I suggest that extra money needs to go to the employer to find the places, in addition to the money going to training providers who arrange the off-the-job element, the evaluation and the assessment. A total of the moneys will go to people who are going down the part-time route, some of which, as was said, will go through the training provider&#151;or the FE college, if that is where they are doing their part-time training&#151;and some of which will go to the employer; there is that total. Another total comes from the money spent in respect of those in full-time education; some of that is for tuition, some is the educational maintenance allowance and some involves child tax benefits and so on. The aggregation that I am talking about would involve looking at this at the national level&#151;what is the total that could possibly be done locally and what is the total of resources going to one type of person compared with another?&#151;and, going down the part-time, job-related route, guaranteeing the amount of resources per person; that would be no less than the amount going to the more privileged group going through the full-time route. That was my suggestion.</p>

One of the most important points about education for the people we are concerned with here is not only gaining knowledge but gaining confidence&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made that point. In the UK over the past 30 or 40 years, once young people leave their workplace and go to college, there has been a marvellous transformation&#151;they have gained the kind of social confidence that formerly I used to see visiting the United States. Britain has been transformed by this. Nevertheless, there are whole areas of Britain in which not enough people can do that. We must make this funding available and have suitable colleges that are reasonably provided with the social and other facilities that are available for people attending universities. This area of justice is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080701104000133"></a>It also makes those people more effective when they go to work, because they have the ability to communicate. It is when they are not as effective as they might be that there is a drain on our economy. I speak as a small employer of 25 people. With my colleagues, I have seen a transformation in the quality of people coming in when they have been to college. That is what we need to invest in, and it is an anomaly that we are not investing as much as we should be in this valuable part of our society.</p>

The complexities of how the different funding streams will work and how they can be accessed easily by employers must be looked at. We all agree that we must do everything we can to ensure that all employers are fully engaged in providing apprenticeships. We were assured in a recent meeting with the Federation of Small Businesses that it sees apprenticeships as important to the development of business. We will need to look much more closely at what the noble Lord, Lord Layard, has said.</p>

This is why we have increased apprenticeship starts from 65,000 in 1997 to 180,000 last year, and are projecting the number of starts to grow to almost 210,000 by 2010-11. In 2007-08, we spent &#163;624 million on apprenticeships, up from &#163;532 million in 2002-03. That is a significant increase in funding. We project that the &#163;624 million of 2007-08 will grow to &#163;776 million in 2010-11&#151;an increase of nearly 25 per cent. We are putting significant resources behind the overall expansion of apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="80701-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080701104000136"></a>On the question of remuneration, apprentices aged 16 to 17, and those who are 18 and in the first year of their apprenticeship, have minimum weekly pay set at a level designed to ensure that they receive at least the same amount as those in full-time education or approved training who are attracting the package of EMA plus child benefit and child tax credits. This is the comparison that my noble friend was making.</p>

<a name="80701-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080701104000137"></a>A recently published survey shows that, in 2007, the average net pay for apprentices was &#163;170 per week. That is significantly more than the maximum package of support available for young people in full-time education or unwaged training, even if any reasonable wages from a part-time job are added in to the equation. However, we have asked the Low Pay Commission to review apprentice pay and the exemption from the national minimum wage. It has called for evidence on this issue and is due to report on its findings and make recommendations to Government by the end of February next year. I am sure that my noble friend will make representations himself to the Low Pay Commission, and we shall certainly draw the commission&#146;s attention to this debate in your Lordships&#146; House. We would not wish to pre-empt the commission&#146;s report by legislating in advance of that evidence and analysis.</p>

It may not be very high, but, as he has indicated, it is well above the educational maintenance allowance level, and paying apprenticeship wages is a very real cost for employers. Research evidence shows that, in the short term, companies are out of pocket on apprentice pay; but, with advanced apprenticeships, they get back more over the longer term than they do in the shorter term. The level of apprentice pay is a real problem. It is much higher in this country than in Holland, Scandinavia or Germany, where regulations keep apprenticeship pay very much lower than in this country.</p>

How we seek to boost that supply is an issue of great concern. I will deal with the specific point mentioned by the noble Baroness; and also with the comments that she made earlier about the direct incentive payments scheme under the LSC&#146;s Train to Gain initiative, whereby employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees are eligible for a contribution to wage costs for employees, in order to help them achieve their first level 2 qualification and/or approved skills for life qualification. This was the specific point raised by the noble Baroness; that  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the scheme does not extend to apprenticeships. I draw her attention, and the attention of my noble friends, to the paper <I>World-class Apprenticeships: Unlocking Talent, Building Skills for All</I> that we published earlier this year. It addresses this issue, and the wider issue of how we might better incentivise employers to offer apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="80701-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080701104000140"></a>Paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 refer specifically to the Train to Gain initiative and the wage subsidies that are provided to small employers. Paragraph 5.17 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="080701104000175"></a>&#147;We believe that this approach should be extended to employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees recruiting Apprentices ... We do not propose across-the-board eligibility for this incentive payment, as the particular risks of employing 16 to 18 year-olds vary across different types of business, as do the benefits for the programme of incentivising growth in this way. It will be targeted where it is likely to bring meaningful growth (for instance, a target group might be cost-sensitive small businesses in a sector that we know to be afflicted by skills shortages), and the criteria will be transparent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000160"></a>It goes on to give other examples of incentive payments that we might make to employers to offer apprenticeships. For example, it cites third sector organisations, which, it says,</p>
<ul><a name="080701104000177"></a>&#147;have also got a significant role to play in the expansion of Apprenticeships ... In recognition of this, the pilot scheme will also include a number of Third Sector organisations. We will set aside sufficient budget to pilot the scheme in this spending period (and to pilot a variety of approaches with different groups), with the intention of revisiting the total budget and best approach, with the benefit of the pilot&#146;s data, in the next Comprehensive Spending Review&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000161"></a>So precisely the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and by my noble friend, about how we might more directly incentivise employers to offer apprenticeships, are being addressed by these pilot schemes and by other measures set out in the world-class apprenticeships paper. We would welcome the views of the noble Baroness and of my noble friend and we hope that, when we have got the data from the pilots, they will look at them with us and help us to reach conclusions about the way forward.</p>

On the question of the employer subsidy, we have a situation where only 30 per cent of large firms provide apprenticeships. It is not just small firms: two-thirds of large firms are not providing apprenticeships. We should not think that a pilot scheme just on small firms will necessarily deal with the problem.</p>

<ul><a name="080701104000178"></a>&#147;we believe that there is scope for moderate growth in Apprenticeship numbers by offering similar direct payment incentives to large companies, so that they can recruit more Apprentices than they need to meet their requirements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701104000162"></a>So the paper also addresses the issue of large employers offering more apprenticeships.</p>

However, my impression is that in many cases training anyone will mean the receipt of a subsidy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080701104000144"></a>This world-class apprenticeships paper is a huge step forward. We have been pootling along over this issue redesignating some workplace training as apprenticeships but, to be honest, without a major breakthrough until now. We are now poised for a major breakthrough and there is only one reason for that, which is this Bill. Unless we can provide many more apprenticeships and satisfy the apprenticeship guarantee, we cannot possibly implement the Bill, and the Bill is incredibly important because of all the other things that follow from it.</p>

<a name="80701-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080701104000145"></a>What concerns me about my noble friend&#146;s reply is the lack of a reference to the general principle of how this group of people should be funded compared with those who go down the full-time route. These are the underprivileged people whose educational future we are trying to lift, but all the inertia in the system will lead to full-time people being treated better than this group. I wonder whether it is possible for the Government to think of some way of tying their own hands, because that is what is required. The pressures from the full-time lobby are so strong that the part-time people will never get a deal unless the Government do that. Surely the Bill is about trying to get a new educational philosophy going. It deals with only about 30 or 40 per cent of the population, and this is the first time that we have had a Bill which is concerned only with the less privileged part of the population. With all the old pressures, the full-time route will get the focus of attention and the focus of the money.</p>

The order before the House today therefore disapplies Section 25 of the Terrorism Act 2006 for a period of one year beginning 25 July 2008, thereby extending for another year the maximum period of pre-charge detention for terrorist suspects of 28 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080701122000007"></a>Terrorist investigations can be hugely time-consuming, and the increase from 14 to 28 days was necessary primarily as a result of the greater use of encrypted computers and mobile phones, the increasingly complex nature of terrorist networks that have to be investigated, and the increasingly international nature of terrorist networks, meaning greater language difficulties and a greater need to gather evidence from different jurisdictions abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080701122000008"></a>The safety of the public is of course paramount, and it is the responsibility of government and security and law enforcement agencies to protect our citizens from the threats posed by terrorism. The first priority must be to stop terrorist activity taking place, rather than dealing with its consequences. However, where we identify those who are engaged in terrorism, we need to ensure that we have the right tools to investigate and prosecute them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080701122000009"></a>In much police work, the investigation takes place after a crime has been committed. In such cases, there will often be a victim, possible suspects, witnesses to the crime and forensic material from the crime scene. The police will investigate the crime and may arrest the suspect once they have gathered a considerable amount of admissible evidence. In such cases, often

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080701122000010"></a>Terrorism cases are different. Because of the severe consequences of a terrorist attack, the police and the Security Service need to intervene before it takes place. Critically, they may need to intervene in an investigation at a very early stage&#151;before they have had the opportunity to gather any admissible evidence and on the basis of intelligence about who and what is involved. As Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick said recently in his evidence to the Counter-Terrorism Bill Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="080701122000242"></a>&#147;In some investigations, we have seen [attack-planning activity] materialise so quickly that on public safety grounds we have had to act pre-emptively before we have had the opportunity to exploit pre-arrest evidential opportunities. That places a huge burden on the ... investigating officer&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Counter-Terrorism Bill Committee, 22/4/08; col. 14.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80701-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080701122000011"></a>Few would disagree with the need to pre-empt such attacks. That is why United Kingdom legislation has, since 2000, provided specific powers of arrest and detention in relation to terrorism. The provisions for extended pre-charge detention of up to 28 days in the Terrorism Act 2006 take account of these practical and unique difficulties. The decision to increase pre-charge detention limits from 14 to 28 days has, I believe, been justified by subsequent events and means that we have been able to bring forward prosecutions that otherwise might not have been possible. Indeed, both the police and the DPP have made it clear that the 28-day limit is necessary. Since the power came into force in July 2006, six people have been held for between 27 and 28 days and three of them have been charged.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080701122000012"></a>We accept that the Government should endeavour to provide detailed statistical information on the use of the 28-day limit in advance of the renewal debates. Once the joint Home Office/police review of pre-charge detention statistics has been completed, we expect to be able to provide more detailed information on the outcome of detention, including the charges brought.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080701122000013"></a>The application for extension is a rigorous process. A CPS lawyer makes the application for an extension beyond 14 days and the senior investigating officer is present. Defence solicitors are provided in advance of each application with a written document setting out the grounds for the application. The applications are usually strenuously opposed and the hearings can last several hours. The officer may be questioned vigorously by the defence solicitor about all aspects of the case. I have attended one of those applications, and it was vigorous. The judge does not have to give another seven days. In the application that I attended, the judge told the applicant they had to get the evidence within two days. It is scrupulously done and strenuously carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080701122000014"></a>Some have accused the police of holding a suspect for the maximum period simply because it is available. This is nonsense. The police investigate as quickly as possible; they must do, and would not detain anyone for longer than is absolutely necessary. That has been clearly demonstrated by the fact that only six people have been held for the maximum period since the  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power came into force in July 2006, and none has been held for the maximum period since the 28-day time limit was renewed last year. Indeed, when applying to the courts for an extension of detention, the police and the CPS have to present substantial evidence for it. A judge may not grant extensions of detention where he or she is not satisfied that the investigation is being pursued diligently and expeditiously. Judges can, of course, grant less than the full seven days&#146; extension, as I have said, or no extension if they feel further detention is unjustified. That, too, happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080701122000015"></a>Getting the balance right between individual freedom and collective security must always be at the heart of what we do. There is no contradiction between pursuing our counter-terrorism objectives and defending our freedoms and civil liberties. Fourteen days&#146; pre-charge detention remains the norm and 28 days is for exceptional circumstances, but this exceptional power continues to be necessary as a result of the growing scale and complexity of terrorist investigations.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080701122000016"></a>All of us, on all sides of the House, appreciate the seriousness of the terrorist threat we face and the importance of having the right measures in place to counter it. Terrorism is a huge international challenge but a particular challenge for democracies, which must strive to protect individual liberties while ensuring collective security. It is vital to strike the balance between protecting the rights of the detainee and ensuring that an investigation proceeds properly and effectively, enabling the police to deal with the complexity of modern terrorism investigations. I hope that this House agrees that the order achieves that, and I commend it to the House. I beg to move.</p>

Section 23 extends the maximum period of pre-charge detention of terrorist suspects from 14 days to 28 days. We support the order. These Benches take the terrorist threat to this country every bit as seriously as the Government do. We are debating it at a time when the Government want to extend the period of pre-charge detention to a maximum of 42 days. In this context, it is worth noting the obvious: the need for Parliament to renew Section 23 annually demonstrates that the extension from 14 to 28 days is already an exceptional power. We scrutinise it frequently because it is such a dramatic departure from normal practice.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080701122000019"></a>Despite its exceptional nature, the extension to 28 days is effectively contained in the law. We should retain it unless there is compelling evidence to go beyond it. The Government have not provided that evidence. The proposals put forward for 42 days also lack the rigorous safeguards currently in place. Section 25 of the Terrorism Act, which says that the period of pre-charge detention will revert to 14 days unless it is disapplied by order each year, is a sunset clause and one of the most important of these safeguards. This is  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_199"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not, of course, the time to debate the merits of the proposals in the Counter-Terrorism Bill but an opportunity to review the operation of the system currently in place. To do so, Parliament must have available to it all necessary information to assess the extension on an evidential basis.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080701122000020"></a>The Government undertook, as the Minister said, to provide detailed statistical information on the use of the 28-day limit in advance of the renewal debates. That was reaffirmed in another place last week, but we do not have the information. We are told that it will only be available once the joint Home Office-police review of pre-charge detention statistics has been completed. How can we, therefore, assess now&#151;at this very moment when we are asked to renew the extension&#151;the use of the 28-day limit? It is an extremely important issue, and not having the necessary information to hand or on time is not at all satisfactory. Can the Minister confirm when the review will be completed and when the statistical information will be provided to Parliament?</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080701122000021"></a>The Government also previously undertook to conduct a risk assessment on the effect of the 28-day extension on communities and, indeed, to conduct risk assessments for all terrorism legislation. That was also reaffirmed in another place last week. Can the Minister confirm what progress the Government have made on this? Despite these concerns, which relate to the Government&#146;s handling of this order, we consider that the current arrangement recognises the seriousness of the terrorist threat and balances the security measures needed to address it with our civil liberties and democratic values.</p>

<a name="080701122000022"></a><a name="80701-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80701-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080701122000309"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, this debate must remind the Minister how fast a year flies by, because he took this order through last year, just after becoming the Minister responsible for terrorism, which we all welcomed because we were aware of his expertise in the area. I notice that, not unreasonably, in large part his wording this year is unchanged from last year. Having said that, given the timing of the debate on renewing this order&#151;a short time before this House&#146;s Second Reading of the Counter-Terrorism Bill&#151;none of the remarks that I make from these Benches should be taken as a mini-rehearsal for that Bill, because this only renews the order.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080701122000023"></a>I also want to ask what has changed since last year. It is important that we do not rubber-stamp the order simply on the presumption that extending it another year with no alteration is favourable. The Minister needs to demonstrate clearly whether the threat has indeed diminished. These Benches would certainly support a necessary measure, but it would be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s view. Given all his work in the past year, the budget he has been able to spend and all the work of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, does he feel that the Government are more on top of the situation than they were this time last year, and does that lessen the threat?</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080701122000024"></a>The changes proposed in the Counter-Terrorism Bill should help with the process, but at the end of all that will be a balance between individual freedom and collective security. I am sorry that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who contributed  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so forcefully to the debate last year, is not here to contribute this evening. Yet, rather as the Minister made many of the same points as last year, I think that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, would have made the same points again. My question, then, is: how have things changed in the past year in the Government&#146;s capacity to deal with this threat? It will be impossible for the Minister to look forward to this time next year, but between now and then we will have had the new Counter-Terrorism Bill, which may have changed the picture somewhat.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080701122000026"></a>I hope that we are not drifting into a situation in which the Joint Committee on Human Rights becomes a ritual formality in its reports. If we have a Joint Committee of that nature, which has high-powered legal and other specialist advice, we should take its reports very seriously. I hope that my noble friend will therefore be able to deal in a little more detail before we conclude our proceedings on some of the significant observations made in the report published on 30 June&#151;yesterday.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080701122000027"></a>The first point to make is that the committee was clearly dismayed that the report of the statutory reviewer of the Terrorism Act was not published,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000277"></a>&#147;in time to allow the House of Commons and its Committees properly to consider it prior to debate on the draft Order&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000216"></a>The second point, which the committee raised in the same sort of context, is that the reviewer's report did not,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000278"></a>&#147;explain how the power to detain suspects for more than 14 days has been used in practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000217"></a>The committee goes on to suggest:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="080701122000243"></a>&#147;Parliament needs this information in order to improve decision-making on this issue&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000218"></a>It recommends that,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000279"></a>&#147;any future report should include this information and that the reviewer report directly to Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000219"></a>It would be very helpful to have my noble friend&#146;s specific observations on those points. The committee also recommends that,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000280"></a>&#147;relevant statistical information and the reviewer's report should be provided to Parliament at least 28 days before debate on these draft Orders to enable meaningful scrutiny of the need for renewal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000220"></a>Again, it would be helpful to have my noble friend's comments.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080701122000028"></a>The report underlines&#151;this is very important&#151;that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="080701122000244"></a>&#147;No suspect has been held for more than 14 days since the renewal of the power last year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000221"></a>We need to know a good deal more about why, therefore, we are renewing the order when it has not been necessary to use it in the past year. To assess how necessary it was, when it was used, to have a period between 14 and 28 days, the Joint Committee suggests that there needs to be a review. It strongly recommends,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000281"></a>&#147;that such an independent review be conducted by [for example] the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080701122000029"></a>In its commitment to human rights and humanitarian concerns, the committee also suggests that there should be independent advice to the Government about,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000282"></a>&#147;the impact on suspects of being detained for longer than  14 days&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000222"></a>It calls for such a process to be undertaken and for a report to be made to Parliament. It also questions how far the proceedings for applying for an extension can really be called &#147;judicial&#148; in how we have come to understand that word in the whole operation of our administration of law.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080701122000030"></a>I became concerned about that matter when I was a member of the committee, not least because&#151;at their request, as I recall&#151;some special advocates came to give evidence to the committee. Some of the things that they said were quite startling. They went on record as saying that in what they were expected to do, they could find very little that was in keeping with all their training and all the custom which had been part of the normal administration of justice.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080701122000031"></a>An issue about which the special advocates felt most strongly was the complete impossibility of having any detailed discussion with the client, the defendant, about what was going on and the reasons for it. They found a real tension there. To be honest, they were in some state of distress about the situation. We questioned them in some detail about how far they were just a group of special advocates who felt especially strongly and how far they were speaking for special advocates as a whole. They said that of course they were leading on the issue but that, in honesty, they felt that it was a concern shared by the whole community of special advocates.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080701122000032"></a>We cannot take that lightly. After all, in our stand against terrorism&#151;no one must ever underestimate the gravity, the sinisterness or the nastiness of the threat&#151;what we are defending is a society worth having. Our administration of justice is a crucial part of the quality of that society. We also want to be very careful that we are not giving the terrorists, the extremists, a victory by beginning to dismantle what we have been used to in the face of the perceived threat. We also have to be very careful that we are not being counter-productive&#151;I am sure that we will debate these things more fully next week&#151;by doing things that play into the hands of extremist manipulators of the more naive, who are open to manipulation.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080701122000033"></a>Those points are rather serious when we come to renew an order of this kind. I hope that my noble friend will be able to speak more specifically about the Government&#146;s position in response to the observations of the Joint Committee. I hope that noble Lords will have realised that I very much share those views, given the work that I was able to do previously in this realm.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080701122000035"></a>However, we should look at the order in context. The fact that there have been no cases in the past year where it has been necessary for someone to be detained for more than 14 days is by no means an argument for saying, &#147;Whoopee&#151;the threat has passed!&#148;. It demonstrates that the police do not willy-nilly hold people for up to 28 days because they have the power to do so. What we have seen in the past year is that the powers have been used appropriately, not excessively. The fact that in the past year there have been no individual instances where it has been necessary to hold someone for more than 14 days tells us nothing about whether the threat has increased or diminished in that period. Obviously, there would come a time if Parliament was asked year after year to approve such an order and there had been no cases in that period where anyone had been held for more than 14 days, when people would say that perhaps it was no longer necessary. But the mere passing of 12 months does not give us any such assurance.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080701122000036"></a>Anyone who has looked at the history and frequency of major terrorist attacks over the past few years will see that there is a periodicity. There are often major attacks in the summer months. Those attacks are often extremely highly organised, involving a large number of people stretching across a number of jurisdictions. Those are precisely the cases where more than 14 days&#151;and possibly 28 days; next week we will debate whether there should be circumstances in which a further extension might be possible&#151;may be needed. Those cases remain. In the past year, we have seen some new developments. We have seen cases of two individuals&#151;the cases are still to come forward&#151;where it is alleged they acted alone to try to create a terrorist act.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080701122000037"></a>If there are individuals who are not obviously operating as part of a network or who are not particularly visibly inspired by particular people, that again gives rise to questions about how the terrorist threat is changing. We may be seeing a variation in terrorist tactics over time. Therefore, the fact that no major plot appears to have been uncovered in the past year that has led to a requirement to detain people for more than 14 days does not mean the threat has disappeared and the order should not go through tonight. That is the most important lesson that emerges.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080701122000038"></a>The mere fact that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has looked into these matters in such detail, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, and the mere fact that we are debating the order seriously tonight and making serious points to which my noble friend Lord West will no doubt wish to respond, demonstrates that this cannot simply be done automatically, on the nod or without consideration. Moreover, while everyone in your Lordships&#146; House is mindful of the risk that actions such as approving this order tonight may be used by those who want to inspire people to go down the route of violent extremism, the fact that Parliament looks at these matters so seriously and debates them so clearly is also evidence that we are not intent on doing these things willy-nilly.</p>

I am very conscious that the Counter-Terrorism Bill is fast coming down the track, and I am very much looking forward to that. There will be considerable debate on it, so I am grateful to noble Lords for making important comments. All of us in this House appreciate the seriousness of the terrorist threat that we face and the importance of having the right measures in place. We might have different views about how that should be done, but I know that we all acknowledge it. That has been reflected in the short but excellent contributions to the debate. As I said, we will have a considerably longer debate in a few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="080701122000041"></a>I shall respond briefly to the specific points that have been made. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked a number of questions. She was interested first in how we can ask to assess the use of the 28 days. This goes to the fact that no one has been held for more than 14 days in the past year of review. My noble friend Lord Harris absolutely correctly pointed out that that indicates a number of things. One is that this is not used willy-nilly by our police force. There is careful thought about what has to be used. He is also absolutely right about the periodicity of these sorts of attacks. We are, as the director-general of the Security Service said, monitoring a large number of plots. I have to be careful at times about what I say. However, the complexity of major plots and when they are dismantled has an impact on the progression of further plots. It is cyclical. It would not be sensible to remove this statute because there has been nothing for the past 12 months, as that could change quite dramatically in the very near future. We need this in our back pocket for all the reasons that I think everyone in the debate has accepted.</p>

<a name="80701-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="080701122000042"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, also asked when the Home Office review on statistics will be completed. I agree that this has not been as rapid as it should have been. I would have liked it to have been faster. We need to pull our finger out. It will come out in the autumn. That is a slightly inflexible timeline, but I will put pressure on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080701122000043"></a>The noble Baroness also asked when the community impact review will be complete. We are considering the scope of the review now. We hope to have the initial findings out by the end of the year, although we have not scoped it yet. That is the way forward.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080701122000044"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked what has changed since this time last year. I have to be very careful here. I am told off when I say this, but I am afraid that I am going to say it anyway: we are safer than we were 12 months ago. I say that because we have done a lot of very good things&#151;a whole spread of things that I will not mention. We have a great quiver full of arrows that we use, but the threat level is  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>still severe. There could be a bomb attack as I speak. That is why one has to be so very careful about saying that, but I think that we are safer. We have done some very good things. The National Counter Terrorism Security Office has been a huge success. The focus that it has put on co-ordination across government has been good. Is it perfect? Far from it. There are lots of things that we still have to do, but there are many specific areas in which I can say that we are safer because of this. As I say, however, that does not mean that we are safe. The threat that we face is huge. Anything could happen at any moment, but we have achieved a great deal.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080701122000045"></a>My answer to the noble Baroness is that we have achieved things. As I said, I probably should not have said that. I am sure that I will be told off by the media people in government for having done so, but I believe that to be the case. Given the effort made by a resource of very bright, hard-working people across government and in the police force, in SO15 and the agencies, that is only to be expected. Considerable resources have been put in, although the threat level, as I say, is still severe.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080701122000046"></a>All speakers in the debate tonight are aware of the balance of rights. We are all believers in habeas corpus, and we are always balancing this terribly difficult thing&#151;the freedom of the individual, which is so crucial to our nation and for which tens of thousands of people have died throughout our history, and the right of our population to live their lives normally as they are entitled to do. That is a very important right, too. We must balance these things, but it is not easy. There is no easy equation in a democracy to do that, but those are absolutely the right things.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080701122000047"></a>On the question of taking people through the judicial process and convicting them, it is interesting that, so far in 2008, 32 people have been convicted in 10 significant terrorist cases. Of those 32, 11 pleaded guilty. We are not going far wrong in identifying people by intelligence, getting the evidence and taking them to trial. In 2007, 36 individuals were convicted in 14 significant terrorist cases, of whom 21 pleaded guilty. That is really quite an achievement.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080701122000048"></a>The more we do this, the more we can get across to people&#151;to the Muslim community&#151;that there is a real risk and that we are trying to do things properly. That is the right way of doing things, but at times it is extremely difficult because, as I say, we have to move quickly. Some of the things that these people wish to do are just horrifying. They want to cause mass casualties among innocent people. Therefore we have to act quickly, and we have to act earlier than one would like to in collecting evidence. That is just a fact of life. I would never want to be in the position in which, because we have adjusted things, the Security Service and particularly the police say, &#147;Let&#146;s just leave it for a couple more days because we want to get that evidence&#148;. If something happened in that couple of days that killed hundreds of our people, I would find that very difficult to live with. That is one of the real problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080701122000049"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd made some very important points. We read very carefully what the Joint Committee on Human Rights says, and what it says is very important.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is certainly not taken lightly; it is very important to us. We go through the review very carefully, and it is very important that we do exactly that.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080701122000050"></a>I have said on the Floor of the House that the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was not published far enough in advance. The Home Office received it on 15 June, and we published it on 23 June. That is not good enough, and we need to do better. People need to be allowed to look at it so that they can make the correct comments. We are aware of that and we must do better. We are working with the independent reviewer to ensure that these reports are published in good time in the future. The role of the independent reviewer is set out in statute, and it is open to Members of this House to propose amendments to the Counter-Terrorism Bill if they want to change it. That could easily be done.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080701122000051"></a>On the judicial process and the judiciary, perhaps I am wrong in this, but I have immense faith in our judges. Having seen one of these processes at Paddington Green, I was impressed by the rigour of what went on. Perhaps it is not absolutely perfect, but my goodness, the judge went into great detail; people there were defending while others in a sense were prosecutors, and all the intelligence and other evidence was looked at. It was a thorough scrutiny. One could debate the issue at length, but overall the system is good and serves as a protection for people in this position&#151;and we are talking about a very small number where there is a lot of intelligence that can be used against them. But, of course, intelligence is not evidence.</p>

He has emphasised how far the system goes to try to ensure fair play. When I was still serving on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we visited Paddington Green and looked at where these proceedings are conducted. It is fair to say that none of us had realised before that sometimes the judge is not present in the room in which the proceedings are taking place, but is in video contact with it. However, the people carrying out the interrogation are sitting in the room. Can my noble friend give an assurance that that practice does not continue? I cannot speak for the committee as a whole, but I for one did not find it convincing when we were told by the police, first, that anyone who wants to go before the judge in his chambers or elsewhere could do so, and secondly, that transporting a defendant to a judge&#146;s chambers creates a huge disruption to London traffic. That is hardly a convincing case for departing from the normal expectations in the administration of justice. It would be helpful if I could be reassured that this matter has been seriously addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080701122000054"></a>My noble friend Lord Harris was absolutely right to make the point that this should be used sparingly.

However, I have to be careful of what I say in order not to tread in sensitive areas. My noble friend also made the interesting point about the alleged self-starters, one in Bristol and another in Exeter. If this is a variation on terrorist tactics, it means that the issue will have to be looked at in a different way. Some interesting issues have to be teased out in this area.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080701122000055"></a>Overall, it is clear that this House understands what kind of threat we face, and that it is very different from that posed by the IRA. This is a threat to our way of life made by people who do not mind dying themselves and who wish to cause mass innocent casualties. That is a very different thing and has to be taken extremely seriously. As I said, I know that we hold different views about exactly how it should be done, but we share the belief that in the final analysis we have to protect and look after our people. I thank all noble Lords for their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="080701122000065"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now move with this group of amendments to Clause 10, which imposes a duty on local authorities to implement the main requirements of the Bill. Theirs is the responsibility to identify and chase up all those young people aged 16 and 17 who are not in school or in college, or in work with training, and to ensure that they are either in a job which includes the requisite training element or that they are helped to get back into education or a job with training. Theirs is the responsibility to find the mentors to counsel these young people with complex needs and to act as their advocates if they stray from the designated path. Theirs, too, is the responsibility to set up the individualised learning programmes to suit the needs of these young people.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="080701122000066"></a>Amendment No. 53 reminds local authorities that they also have the responsibility to look to the education and training needs of young people who are in the care of youth offending teams or in custody. During the passage through this House of the Children and Young Persons Bill earlier this year, we had much  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discussion on the needs of young people who were in custody or under the care of the youth offending teams. Indeed, many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, were passionately concerned that they should continue to get the care from local authorities that they would receive if they were, in that particular case, looked-after young people. The need for continuing mentoring and friendship through the social services is a necessary part of their lives.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="080701122000067"></a>Equally, there was on the part of many noble Lords some scepticism about the degree to which local authorities had the capacity to meet these requirements; that on many occasions they rather conspicuously failed to deliver on their duties towards looked-after children and others with complex social and educational needs. This is where Amendments Nos. 58 and 65 come in. Local authorities do not deliver on their duties because often they do not have the resources to do so. Amendment No. 58 expressly concerns resources. Money for schools is now directly mandated by the Treasury and ring-fenced for this purpose in local authority budgets&#151;the term is &#147;passported directly to the schools&#148;. Presumably this will also be true of the further education colleges once the LSC has been abolished. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the 16 to 19 element of funding, which currently comes through the LSC, will be part of the schools&#146; budgets and meet the same rules of being passported through. The division of these sums between schools is now the job of the schools forums. Amendment No. 58 reminds those forums of the new responsibilities which fall on local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080701122000068"></a>Amendment No. 65 adds the words &#147;and reasonable&#148; to the caveats in Clause 12. Local authorities do not have infinite resources. The cost of pursuing young people who are supposedly in their area of responsibility possibly to all parts of the planet is just not feasible. What is possible may carry a totally unacceptable cost to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080701122000069"></a>Amendments Nos. 57 and 67 put the onus on the local authorities to establish whether the young person has special educational needs which need to be addressed. Amendment No. 67 had been proposed to us by TreeHouse and the National Autistic Society. In their briefing, they remind us that autism is a complex condition that affects one in 100 school-age children. Children with autism represent 16.2 per cent of the children with statements of special educational needs. There are many barriers faced by young people with autism and their families in the current education system. More than 40 per cent of children with autism are bullied at school. Statistics on exclusion rates from school further indicate the problems faced: 27 per cent of children with autism have been excluded from school, a quarter of them on more than one occasion. Pupils with special educational needs are nine times more likely to be permanently excluded from school than the rest of the school population. In the past few years, there has been an increase in the number of pupils with special educational needs on fixed-period exclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="080701122000070"></a>Despite these shockingly poor indicators of the experiences of children with autism, education is accepted as the best intervention. It is essential that the existing

Clause 10 establishes the duty on local education authorities to promote the participation of young people in education or training in their area who are subject to the duty to participate. We of course do not wish those young people to be under a duty, so have tabled amendments with alternative wordings.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="080701122000074"></a>Our problem with Clause 10 is the apparent imbalance between the responsibilities of young people to comply with the obligations established by the Bill and the much looser duties placed on local authorities. These concerns have been raised in another place and by the Special Educational Consortium. As currently drafted the Bill imposes sanctions which can include criminal penalties for individual pupils who are not in appropriate full-time education or training, but imposes only a general duty through Clause 10 on LEAs to promote participation in such education or training.</p>

<a name="80701-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="080701122000075"></a>Young people can benefit from the Bill only if a range of appropriate, high-quality provision is available to them. The duty set out in this amendment is intended to rebalance those responsibilities. It would place an explicit duty on LEAs to secure sufficient and appropriate provision for their population of 16 to 18 year-olds. Currently, responsibility for provision for 16 to 18 year-olds rests with the Learning and Skills Council. When responsibility is transferred to local authorities, a stronger duty should be imposed. As my colleague John Hayes said on this subject in another place,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000284"></a>&#147;the more insistent that we can be and the Bill can be on these matters, the better.

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080701122000077"></a>The Liberal Democrats have tabled Amendment No. 67, which would identify the failing with reference to any special educational needs. I entirely endorse that. It is deeply worrying that many young people who are labelled as disruptive, or who are falling behind, actually have special needs that simply are not being picked up. There must be protection written into the Bill so that those who are left behind because they have special needs are not then penalised because nothing has been done to identify their problem and to help them.</p>

However, on Report he very much wants to object to the clause remaining in the Bill, and I hope that that will be accepted. His view is that this is not the right time to be placing this requirement on local authorities. There will be no duty on them for a number of years, but there will be a duty, and he is keen that it should be quite firm, on local authorities to provide the facilities when the funding is transferred to them from the Learning and Skills Council. That is his view, and I hope it will be acceptable if he makes that case rather more specifically when he returns to your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

The whole point of these various amendments, which have already been spoken to, is that they will require local authorities to take a much stronger line on this and to have a specific duty to fulfil those needs. I totally support what is being said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="080701122000085"></a>I cannot escape mentioning the way in which Amendment No. 53, by referring to those in custody, puts its finger on the supreme irony of a system which compels people to do something when they have very little freedom of choice and where the ultimate sanction is that they go into custody. There is a certain Alice in Wonderland dimension to that. We will return on Report to the question of compulsion and perhaps it is better to reserve anything else that needs to be said on that until then, but I cannot help looking at this sad picture of the person already in prison compelled to complete a duty which he cannot possibly do unless everybody else does their job of providing him the means to do it and the threat of imprisoning him if he does not.</p>

First, as a wording technicality, requiring a local authority to do everything that is &#147;possible&#148; is really putting no limit on things. Local authorities would be compelled to employ private investigators to chase children round the world to establish where they were, and children can be extremely good at getting lost under those circumstances. So &#147;reasonable&#148; does seem to be the right word in practical terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="080701122000087"></a>Secondly, I am not sure that it is the local authority that ought to be doing this. The Government will be running the national children&#146;s database and they are also intending to keep a complete record of who is doing what courses. These things are not happening, particularly once children reach the age of 16, at a local authority level. Children of that age are able to leave home and many of them will. They will be living in relatively informal arrangements with other people. A local authority will have no natural way of finding out about these people. It will take a central register to establish whose training activity is not known and a central effort to find out where these young people have got to and bring them to the attention of the local authority. We do not want 100-odd local authorities all chasing round independently, trying to find out where Sam Jones, who used to live in the area but now does not appear to, has got to, or which kids are in the area whose homes are not there. It is going to be extremely difficult to track these pupils down if you do it in that disaggregated way. Given the tools that the Government have to do this, it might be better to run it centrally, even if at the end of the day the local authorities then pick up the challenge of helping the kids back into education.</p>

We entirely support the intention behind it. Young offenders are among the most vulnerable young people and are at serious risk of missing out on the education and training that they so badly need.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="080701122000090"></a>The duty on a local authority, created by Clause 10, to promote effective participation in learning of all young people, subject to the new duty in Clause 2, already includes young offenders, so it would not be necessary to specify them separately. However, we have recently consulted on proposals to give local authorities responsibility for providing education for young offenders in custody. Our document <I>Raising Expectations: </I><I>E</I><I>nabling the </I><I>S</I><I>ystem to </I><I>D</I><I>eliver</I> states in paragraph 3.46:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="080701122000249"></a>&#147;Consistent with the principle that local authorities should plan, commission and fund education and training for all children and young people, we want them to do so for young people in juvenile custody (who are aged 10-17 and some 18 year-olds nearing the end of their sentence). Despite recent improvements, standards of provision still fall short of what we would expect for young people in mainstream education. New planning and funding arrangements for young people in custody must foster improved outcomes, including progression and achievement in education, and hence contribute to reducing re-offending&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000226"></a>Clear commitments are made there. We will see whether&#151;I have to choose my words a little carefully, because I cannot pre-empt legislation&#151;it would be appropriate to make these changes in forthcoming legislation in the next Session.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080701122000091"></a>The intended effects of Amendment No. 57 of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, also are already secured in the legislation. Clause 10 puts a duty on local authorities to promote participation for all 16 and 17 year-olds in their area to whom the central duty applies. That includes those with learning difficulties or special educational needs. We agree that it is important to recognise the additional barriers that some young people face, including those with SEN. It is important to diagnose learning difficulties as early as possible. That is why we announced in the Children&#146;s Plan an additional &#163;18 million of spending which, among other things, is to improve the workforce&#146;s knowledge, skills and understanding of SEN and learning difficulties through better initial teacher training and continuing professional development. I launched the new units for initial teacher training last week to give effect to the first phase of our investment in this area.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="080701122000092"></a>The Bill seeks to strengthen assessment arrangements and accountability for those with learning difficulties through Clause 65. We will spell out in statutory guidance to local authorities that every young person with learning difficulties who is likely to benefit from an assessment should receive one. We have already consulted stakeholders on drawing up this guidance, and the Special Educational Consortium, which has also briefed noble Lords, recently commented that it was happy to be involved in the process and is pleased with the progress being made. I can reassure the Committee that Connexions and local authorities will continue

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="080701122000093"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 58. When determining the resources required by schools and colleges, we already expect local authorities to have regard to their duty to promote participation, as they will have regard to all their duties. The amendment makes assumptions about how the new funding system will operate when the transfer of resources from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities is implemented in 2010-11. It is premature to make such assumptions given that the details of the new funding system will be subject to the outcome of ongoing consultation about how to take forward these proposals.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="080701122000094"></a>These changes should be implemented from the academic year 2010-11, which is well before plans to raise the participation age will be implemented. They will be put in place using the primary legislation, which, as I said earlier, is likely to be brought before the House in the next parliamentary Session, including amendments as necessary to the School Standards and Framework Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="080701122000095"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, raised issues relating to Clause 10 on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who we are sorry is unable to be in his place. The duty placed on local authorities is a necessary corresponding duty to the one on young people to participate in education or training. These duties are two sides of the same coin. The duty on young people cannot be delivered without the support of local authorities. If this clause were removed, as the noble Lord has suggested, Clause 2 would still place a duty on young people to participate, but there would be no corresponding duty on local authorities to enable this, or to encourage them to do so. The noble Lord and I discussed this issue in a meeting. I give way.</p>

That was his aim. I was delighted to hear that there will be a responsibility for certain groups with special educational needs to receive education up to the age of 25. Perhaps I may also ask about young offenders who, again, do not have the right skills and are in prison until that sort of age. Who will pay for their educational needs? Will they be part of this Bill&#146;s responsibilities? Whose responsibility will they be?</p>

To what extent will their being in custody limit the curriculum and other choices open to them? There must be real difficulties in that area. Is it proposed, for instance, that there should be apprenticeships available within the prison industries? I should have thought almost certainly not. I would want to be reassured about the ability of that part of the Prison Service to meet the requirements satisfactorily before that was proposed.

The forms of education and training that are made available in the secure estate have to be consistent with the requirements of detention, which significantly limits the capacity to offer apprenticeships. The noble Lord raised the issue of what scope there is for apprenticeships to be offered within the prison industries. I suspect that is also very limited, but I will address that.</p>

Returning to Clause 10, following an intervention to an intervention, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and I discussed this issue with Peers at the open meeting on the Bill a week ago. I explained to the noble Lord, but I say again for the record, that the duties in Clause 10 range far more widely than those in respect of the funding that will be transferred from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities, under legislation likely to come forward in the next Session. Local authorities have a wide range of other duties, including the provision of support services, targeted services for vulnerable groups, and the sort of training and education opportunities that we discussed earlier in our proceedings. These range far more widely than the direct funding of 16 to 18 education, which will be transferred to them under the legislation expected in the next Session. Clause 10 is a flexible clause, which takes account of that. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="080701122000250"></a>&#147;A local education authority in England must ensure that its functions are (so far as they are capable of being so exercised) exercised so as to promote the effective participation in education or training of persons belonging to its area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000227"></a>That duty will also apply to functions as they are extended by future legislation. Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate that this clause should be in the Bill. Its practical impact will increase as the tools available to local authorities to promote participation increase with forthcoming legislation.</p>

I am not sure that he has addressed my noble friend&#146;s question on where responsibility lies if the young person crosses the boundaries of two local authorities. The Minister says that we cannot pre-empt the levels of local authority funding until the legislation comes into force, but how can he say with confidence that adequate funding will be in place for the increased numbers who will stay on in education when the legislation comes into force?

It would be particularly good if he could clarify the situation of those in custody. I would be grateful if he will send us a copy of the letter that he sends to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. If he produces a further background note for the noble Lord, Lord Elton, perhaps we could see that as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080701122000114"></a>We wanted to include in Clause 10 those who are in custody precisely because local authorities occasionally forget their explicit duties under the Children Act and it is sometimes necessary to remind them. As the Minister suggests, that might be dealt with more appropriately in the legislation that he brings forward next year, but it would nevertheless be good to see it somewhere in the legislative framework.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080701122000115"></a>One issue that worries me slightly relates to those who have special educational needs but who do not get a statement. As the Minister well knows, some of them fall under the category of &#147;school action&#148;. In particular, those who are categorised as &#147;school action plus&#148; fall on the borderline of needing a statement, but they may not get one. Many of these young people are vulnerable for the same reasons as are those with special educational needs who have a statement that they are vulnerable. It is important that even those without a statement continue to get the educational and training support that they received in school. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, it is necessary to regard 14 to 19 as a continuum, as distinct from regarding 16 and 17 year-olds as separate.</p>

<a name="80701-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="080701122000116"></a>The Minister said that every young person with a statement will be looked after by the Connexions service and receive support and so on. Nevertheless, those covered by &#147;school action plus&#148;, who may well leave school and start some form of work with training when they are 17, often still need some sort of support. It is necessary to think about that issue. I think we will return to it in the next group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080701122000117"></a>Finally, I have not addressed the Question on whether Clause 10 should stand part. We on these Benches recognise that someone has to implement the legislation, and it seems obvious that it should be the local education authority. I recognise the logic of the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. However, central government already have their fingers in so many pies that it would be a good thing if they kept them out of a few. Although the right place for this responsibility might be the local authorities, this business of the permeable frontiers which they have to cope with poses some difficulties. We have largely not questioned that Clause 10 should stand part. However, we are extremely anxious that local authorities should have the resources needed to deliver on Clause 10. We are very much with the official Opposition in not feeling confident that the Government will give local authorities the resources they need to deliver their aspirations. We are also not confident about local authorities recognising their duties, which includes both the custody issue and special educational needs. But we will come back to those issues in other groupings and undoubtedly on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

These two amendments deal with the responsibilities placed on local authorities by Clause 10, which make them the effective body required to implement this part of the Bill. The purpose of the first amendment is to require local authorities to audit the sufficiency and diversity of education and training provision in

The second is to ensure that there is a suitable place for every young person aged 16 to 18, whatever their needs.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="080701122000123"></a>The Secretary of State must be satisfied that there is sufficient and diverse provision before the duty to participate under Clause 2 can come into force. These amendments have been proposed to us by the Special Educational Consortium. The consortium is anxious, pointing out that there are approximately 772,000 disabled children under the age of 16 and that around one in five pupils have some form of special educational need.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="080701122000124"></a>The Special Educational Consortium supports the fundamental principles of the Education and Skills Bill, including the proposal to extend the requirement to stay in school and education to the age of 18. It recognises that many 16 year-olds also stay on in school or move into further education and training. However, those most at risk in the system are least likely to stay on, and that disproportionately includes disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs. The Disability Rights Commission found that non-disabled young people are twice as likely as their disabled peers to transfer to sixth form or college at 16-plus. This has a significant impact on life chances. By the age of 19, 9 per cent of non-disabled young people are not in education, employment or training whereas, by our definition, 27 per cent of disabled young people are NEETs.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080701122000125"></a>One of the Special Educational Consortium&#146;s key concerns is the balance of responsibility between individual young people and the local education authorities. As currently drafted the Bill imposes sanctions that can include criminal penalties for individual pupils who are not in appropriate full-time education or training, as it imposes only a general duty through Clause 10 on local education authorities to promote participation in such education and training. In line with Barnardo&#146;s, the Special Educational Consortium believe that the success of the Bill will rely on providing the relevant learning opportunities and appropriate support for young people with SEN who want to stay on. The Special Educational Consortium believes that young people can benefit from the Bill only if local authorities have the appropriate capacity to make the assessments and if there is a range of appropriate high quality provision available to them.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080701122000126"></a>The duties set out in the amendments would rebalance responsibilities. It would place an explicit duty on local authorities to audit the sufficiency and diversity of education and training provision in their area and ensure that they have the appropriate assessment capabilities and that there is a suitable place and support for every young person aged 16 to 18, particularly disabled young people and those with learning difficulties or special educational needs.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080701122000127"></a>Many local authorities currently find it quite difficult to meet the requirements for assessment within the current age ranges in schools. Children with special educational needs are often identified in primary schools, even in reception classes. By the age of six or seven, many of the behavioural traits that lead the children later to drop out of school are apparent but the help that schools get from their local education authorities,  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from educational psychologists and behaviour support and management, is often not very great&#151;one or two afternoons a term from an LEA specialist. In particular, there is a huge shortage&#151;I have spoken of this before&#151;of educational psychologists. Partly because of that shortage, turnover is great. Many schools find that they are just not getting the support that they need. If our aspiration is that these young people should be able to receive through local authorities the support that is in the Bill, many local authorities will have to think hard about their provision. Currently, the responsible core provision for 16 to 18 year-olds rests with the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080701122000128"></a>I return to the arguments of the Special Educational Consortium. It recognises that the duty set out in the amendments could not be implemented until funding and responsibility is transferred to local authorities. That will require further legislation, which we have just discussed.</p>

<p><a name="080701122000229"></a>It requires local authorities to,</p>

<p><a name="080701122000230"></a>Amendment No. 61A relates to the,</p>

<p><a name="080701122000231"></a>It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="080701122000260"></a>&#147;A local education authority in England must ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the provision of education and training is sufficient to meet the requirements of young persons in their area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000232"></a>In determining this, it must,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000288"></a>&#147;have regard to the needs of young persons ... for a diverse range of academic and vocational provision ... must have regard to the provision of education and training which is suitable for disabled young persons and those with learning difficulties, and ... must have regard to the adequacy of assessment procedures in relation to special educational needs and the importance of early assessment and continuing support if a young person with special educational needs is to fulfil his potential, and ... may have regard to any education and training which they expect to be available outside their area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000233"></a>The amendments would put substantial responsibilities on local authorities to provide this diversity of provision and to meet the needs of those with special educational needs and disabilities. I beg to move.</p>

These are sensible new clauses and echo what we on these Benches have been saying: that the Bill, as it stands, talks too much about the duties of young people and not enough about the duties and responsibilities of local authorities. We are very supportive of the idea of making it clear that local authorities must take those duties seriously.</p>

This role covers all the aspects set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, in her opening remarks. Under Section 2 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Learning and Skills Council is required to secure the provision of proper facilities for,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000289"></a>&#147;education (other than higher education) suitable to the requirements of persons who are above compulsory school age but have not attained the age of 19 ... training suitable to the requirements of such persons ... organised leisure-time occupation connected with such education, and ... organised leisure-time occupation connected with such training&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000234"></a>It defines facilities as proper if they are,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000290"></a>&#147;of a quantity sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of individuals&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000235"></a>including, of course, individuals with learning difficulties and/or disabilities&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000291"></a>&#147;and of a quality adequate to meet those needs&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80701-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="080701122000132"></a>Therefore, when the LSC undertakes its planning responsibilities, it already takes account of the elements that Amendment No. 61A specifically mentions; that is to say, it draws up commissioning plans at a regional level, recognising the need for a diverse range of academic and vocational provision, and ensuring suitable provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080701122000133"></a>The Bill seeks to strengthen the assessment provisions for young people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. We will spell out in statutory guidance to local authorities that every young person with learning difficulties who is likely to benefit from an assessment should receive one under Clause 65. Local authorities will be legally required to have regard to this guidance, and we believe that it will ensure that provision in this area is sufficient.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080701122000134"></a>As I said, it is our intention that responsibility for funding and commissioning 16 to 19 provision will be transferred from the LSC to local authorities from 2010. Local authorities will be responsible from 2013 for making a reality in their area the national entitlement to a new, wider choice of options. Drawing on the plans drawn up by their local 14-19 partnerships, local authorities will be required to analyse demand from young people and ensure that choices are informed by good information, advice and guidance. They will compare the pattern of demand to the existing pattern and performance of local provision, and work with schools, colleges and other providers to assess the best way of filling any gaps and promoting quality. This analysis and these decisions will lead to a commissioning plan agreed within and outside the area, either as part of, or closely aligned to, the local authority&#146;s children and young people plan.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080701122000135"></a>Local authorities will work together in subregional groups in their commissioning, in order to analyse and understand demand from across the travel-to-learn areas of all their learners, to consider gaps in provision and to share judgments of quality. Local authorities need to plan for all young people up to the age of 25. For some, including learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, provision may be highly specialised and costly. Planning across a wider area for such provision will be particularly important.</p>

Subject to such a legislative slot being available and the Bill being passed, by the time the policy to raise the participation age comes into force, local authorities will have duties to secure sufficient appropriate provision, including provision for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. They will also have duties to keep that provision under review. We therefore do not believe that it would be appropriate to legislate here for these new duties. However, I hope that I have given sufficient assurances to the noble Baroness for her to be confident that the existing planning duties on the Learning and Skills Council meet the points that she has raised, and that we will transfer and strengthen those duties when local authorities take them over, under legislation to be forthcoming in the next Session.</p>

However, the clause is entirely silent on how they should ascertain that and it does not provide any helpful mechanisms to enable them to do so. I spent a good deal of my life trying to get information out of educational establishments, which in many cases is extremely difficult. They are not set up to answer questions from people outside. They often tend to be neither efficient nor helpful and, when

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080701122000145"></a>It has been made very clear by parties whom we have consulted, including the Institute of Directors, 70 per cent of whose members are small and medium-sized enterprises, and others, that one of the biggest day-to-day problems facing business is the ever-increasing flow of red tape and bureaucracy. We want to keep the burdens imposed on employers to an absolute minimum; otherwise, we run the risk of seeing the young people whom we are trying to help in this Bill excluded from the workforce because the bureaucracy involved is too daunting and time-consuming. I seek the Minister&#146;s assurances on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080701122000146"></a>Amendment No. 112 is a probing amendment. The intention behind it is to ensure that training is rigorous and of a high quality; in other words, that it is sufficient for purpose and not merely relevant for the needs of the learner who requires new skills. I have chosen the word &#147;sufficient&#148; because I am talking about the level of learning that is to be achieved; otherwise, we will just be wasting everyone&#146;s time. The amendment would ensure such an outcome, as I am sure the Minister will agree.</p>

Three-quarters of those businesses have no human resource support, so any hiring, firing, recruiting, training or monitoring will be done by someone taking time out from their main job.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080701122000149"></a>Small businesses are an essential part of the national economy, and in the current climate, when times are particularly hard for them, they will naturally take actions to increase their profitability. You do not run a flourishing small business without being quite aware of the rules and regulations, and how you can work with them. The requirements of the Bill&#151;specifically, within Clause 21&#151;provide a significant disincentive to employ 16 to 17 year-olds. For instance, the cost of checking that the 16 or 17 year-old has,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000292"></a>&#147;made appropriate arrangements for training or education&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000150"></a>which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, mentioned, will not always be straightforward. Indeed, the employer might well ask themselves whether they would be infringing the age discrimination law by asking a young person&#146;s date of birth.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="080701122000151"></a>There are various other factors, including that these young people rarely stay in a job for any length of time&#151;often, only a few months&#151;so there will be frequent employee turnover. Training programmes may vary, with delays in gaining an appropriate training opportunity, for instance, when the timings might not suit the working day so that employers may have to alter other work schedules or call on other employees to work more flexibly, to fit around the young person.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080701122000152"></a>Employers will need clear guidance on this clause. At its simplest, there will be additional administrative burdens. We had a government projection that a 10-minute check would be required. That seems optimistic, and a conservative estimate has been set that employers checking for any young person might accumulate some &#163;8 million a year across all businesses. Indeed, there are higher estimates from calculating, using the hourly rate, the time spent on this additional monitoring which could be made earning money in the main course of the business.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="080701122000153"></a>We are talking about a cohort of young people who may not have responded well, if at all, at school&#151;that has come up in previous interventions from your Lordships&#151;but who could learn valuable, on-the-job training and transferable life skills if they go into employment, even if that is not directly associated with formal qualifications and training. The demands of this clause could well close off some of those routes. If it is simpler to look elsewhere, employers cannot be blamed for being more attracted to employing 18 year-olds, or even migrant workers, rather than this cohort that carries additional burdens for them. The employer organisations the CBI and the IoD have expressed concerns about the impact of this clause. Little will be lost by removing the employers&#146; statutory obligation to check on appropriate education or training, but if the clause remains it could significantly affect the job prospects of some of the young people who need the most encouragement. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

I have just heard the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, put a case for having no duties at all on employers to ensure that their employees are undergoing proper education or training. Yet Amendment No. 112, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, would significantly increase the duties on employers because, in addition to checking that the young employees are participating, they would be required to check the number of hours that those individuals are in education and training, in order to ascertain whether that was &#147;sufficient&#148;, which is what she seeks to do by inserting that word. Such detailed checks to ascertain not merely that a young person is engaged in education and training but that the number of hours required in the Bill are completed would be a complicated and time-consuming exercise, which we do not think it would be appropriate to expect employers to undertake. For example, if checking hours added 10 minutes to our overall estimate of the time needed for employers to fulfil their duties under the clause, the cost to employers would double. We are certainly not minded to go further than we set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="080701122000236"></a></p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="080701122000155"></a>Why do we think it right to go as far as we do in the Bill&#151;the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, in her remarks on whether Clause 21 should stand part? We have worked hard with employer groups to ensure that the duties on employers are as light touch as they possibly can be, but deleting the clause would mean that employers would be under no duty whatever to check that young people are in learning before letting them start work. That would mean that a young person could start work breaking the law and the employer would, knowingly or unknowingly, be complicit in that act. That is not acceptable. If the law is to be enacted, employers should exercise responsibility to ensure that their employees within that age range are undertaking education or training.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="080701122000156"></a>The clause is designed to place an important incentive on young people who want to work to get a place in learning first, knowing that they will not be able to get a job if they have not. Having no duties on employers would seriously disrupt the balance of roles and responsibilities that is fundamental successfully to raising the participation age, so we are anxious that the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="080701122000157"></a>Amendment No. 60, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on certificates, is, we believe, covered by the Bill. The question of whether a young person in employment has made appropriate arrangements for their part-time education or training will depend on whether they are working towards accredited qualifications, not on the type of institution at which they are doing so. They could be studying towards an accredited qualification at any one of a range of institutions: a maintained school, an independent school, a sixth-form college, an FE college or a private training provider. All those institutions can already provide young people with a letter confirming their offer of a place or their enrolment on a course and will already routinely do so. They do not need a legal power  to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="080701122000158"></a>We will, however, provide employers with clear and simple guidance about what they need to look for in a letter of confirmation shown to them by a young person whom they want to employ, to see that the duties on employers are not unduly onerous&#151;for the reasons set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Garden. We will involve employers in developing that guidance and consult them on it, so that it meets their needs. Employers will not be expected to contact a learning provider to check that a young person is enrolled although, if they wish to do so, or to discuss the detail of the course that the young person is undertaking, the contact details would normally be found on a letter from the provider.</p>

On one hand, he tells my noble friend Lady Garden that it is not reasonable to take away the employer's duty to check at all; but on the other, he tells the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, that the Government do not intend that employers should spend a lot of time satisfying themselves that the education and training arrangements that the young person has made fulfil the duty by including enough hours, because that would take them too long. I certainly agree with that approach. Can the Minister explain what the word &#147;appropriate&#148; in Clause 21 means? He suggests that the employer must be satisfied that all such steps as are reasonable have been taken by the young person to make,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000293"></a>&#147;appropriate arrangements for training or education&#148;.</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="080701122000265"></a>&#147;Clause 21 places a duty on employers not to employ a person unless they have taken reasonable steps to check that the person has made appropriate arrangements to participate in relevant education or training. The duty does not require the employer to check that the relevant training or education is sufficient (that is enough hours in the relevant period). For example, an employer would check that a potential employee could produce a letter from a learning provider indicating that he or she had enrolled on a course&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000238"></a>As I said earlier, we want those letters to be in a standard format so that they are easy for employers to use. The Explanatory Notes continue:</p>
<ul>

If the employer is not to check whether the young person has taken full responsibility to fulfil their duty to participate, what is the point of checking at all? The young person might just have enrolled on some embroidery class for an hour a week. The clause does not do the job. It would take employers far too much time to check properly, which is why we on these Benches suggest that there is no point to Clause 21.</p>

I have the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, saying that there should be no duties on employers, and the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, saying that there should be enhanced duties on employers, who should now have to check the precise number of hours. It is reasonable that there is a duty to check that the young person is engaged, or has made arrangements to be engaged, in education or training.</p>

However, we do not want to specify the nature of those checks in excessive detail. In very many cases, it is quite likely that the letters that are produced by the learning providers will specify the number of hours. We are talking about the statutory minimum requirements on employers, and a requirement that they should make a check, which will be a significant incentive for the young person, is a reasonable step in the circumstances. There is a balance of duties on employers, on young people, and, as we discussed earlier, on local authorities, but we do not want to go down the Conservative road of over-regulating employers by requiring them to have to check the precise number of hours in all cases.</p>

So we come back again to my suggestion that there should be some kind of document. If we are to have a letter from an education provider anyway, we may as well say what that letter should contain&#151;that it should provide contact details; that it should involve giving permission for conversation; and that it should say that the training satisfies the 280 hours the duty requires. It is a simple thing to require an education provider to do and seems the easiest way of getting round the problem. I shall not chase the Minister further at  the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="080701122000189"></a>The noble Lord said: I gather that there is a scintilla of time in which to examine my humble offering. The amendment is a kite with a long string. It is within the terms of the Long Title of the Bill but it does not address the young people in the age group with which the Bill is concerned; it considers the condition of young people as they arrive in that age group. That condition is determined by the state of the compulsory education system as it now is. I think we all agree that there is in it a deep malaise, which is reflected in what is happening on our streets and in our society.</p>

<a name="80701-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080701122000190"></a>In seeking to consider this in the context of the Bill, with the indulgence of the House, because I think it is important and relevant, I sought to find one aspect of the legislation which could be used to address a central issue. What is too often wrong with the schools preparing these people for this stage in their education is that they are disorderly. There is bad behaviour in classes, which disrupts the teaching. There is disregard for authority, which leads to rebellion. I regret to say that in a number of schools a number of children feel safer on the street in a gang than they do either at home or in school. I have heard that said in some parts of south London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="080701122000191"></a>What can be done to stabilise this circumstance and how can central government do anything to achieve that? I regard legislation as the last resort. As I say, this amendment is a kite rather than a substantive proposal. In inquiries that I helped to conduct many  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_229"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years ago, under circumstances which were quite appropriate to make them relevant to this day, in visits to a large number of schools this country and a number in other countries we found that one of the best ways to secure a policy of behaviour among school children conducive to their learning in the classroom as well as their good conduct outside the school was to involve them in the management of the school discipline policy. We advised head teachers in particular and staff generally to involve the children in questions of discipline.</p>

<a name="80701-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="080701122000192"></a>One of the most convenient forums for this is a school council where matters of discipline naturally come up quite quickly for discussion between the pupils and staff. They must recognise that as effective and not merely a bit of window-dressing&#151;nothing is more damaging than a token school council where the teachers appear to pay attention and do the opposite. A school council in which teachers and children together work out what minimal rules of behaviour will effectively enable the security of the children, the stability of the environment and the process of learning. Different schools, localities and cultures require different approaches. That is why any legislation should be as general and permissive as possible. I have intentionally said the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;shall&#148; issue guidelines in relation to this.</p>

<a name="80701-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="080701122000193"></a>To what extent is the Minister&#146;s department aware of the way maintained schools generally deal with the whole school discipline policy? Where do they think it is going wrong and why? I beg to move.</p>

We agree with the objective of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, but noble Lords will notice that there are a number of differences between his amendment and ours. In particular, ours is flawed and his is not, necessarily. We are of course aware that schools no longer have to provide a yearly report to parents, much though we perhaps wish that they should.</p>

<a name="80701-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="080701122000195"></a>We did not simply add our names to the noble Lord&#146;s amendment because his refers only to schools. Given that many of the young people at whom this Bill aims will not be studying at schools, our amendment talks of &#147;educational institutions&#148;. Some kind of democratically elected mechanism to provide the management of the school with the voice of the students is just as relevant and appropriate in FE as it is in schools. We would like to see something like the noble Lord&#146;s amendment in the Bill but referring to educational institutions as a whole and not just schools.</p>

<a name="80701-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="080701122000196"></a>We also hesitated to be too prescriptive about the way in which the voice of the students should be collected, although I am encouraged by the wording in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, &#147;or other collective mechanism&#148;. We devised our own amendment that did not specify a school council because we did not want to be too prescriptive; we wanted to give schools the opportunity to be creative and respond appropriately to their own circumstances, devising their own ways of gathering students&#146; views, and to put pressure on them to do so by giving them a duty to report on it. We felt that the most appropriate people to report to would be the parents and the local authority. In doing so, of  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_230"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column 230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>course, they would report to their own students and would be accountable to them as to how they were reflecting their views. The elements that we believe are the most important are that we are not too prescriptive, that the voice of the student should be collected in a democratic and appropriate way and that the matter should apply not just to schools but to other educational institutions to which the young people of the age group we are referring to might go.</p>

<a name="80701-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="080701122000198"></a>I know that CRAE, the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England, has supported such a move to give children a voice. I agree with my noble friend&#146;s remarks on the desirability of setting up such a mechanism. As I understand it, the introduction of a statutory basis for school councils in Wales in 2006 has been monitored by Estyn, the body responsible for school inspection in Wales. Estyn considers that the regulations have,</p>
<ul><a name="080701122000295"></a>&#147;enabled the participation agenda to make progress and gain support quickly in schools&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000240"></a>That fits neatly with the issue that we have all been raising in the Bill about how crucial it is to engage children at an early age to stop them becoming disaffected with education, which leads to such depressing truancy rates and total disengagement later on. Part of that engagement process will inevitably mean listening to young people&#146;s views and taking them into account when making decisions that affect them.</p>

<a name="80701-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="080701122000199"></a>However, I sound a note of caution, just as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, did. It may not be the best course of action to be too prescriptive. We think that it is best left up to schools, not central government, to decide on the best way to engage their students. But we sincerely hope that in sharing best practice, schools will see the relevance of thriving, dynamic school councils. The noble Baroness makes another valid point about educational institutions.</p>

<a name="80701-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="080701122000200"></a>I assume, and I am sure that the Minister will tell me if I am wrong, that this must be an area that Ofsted looks at. Presumably, it could recommend setting up a school council if it felt that the school was failing to consult with, or listen to, its pupils.</p>

What is slightly worrying me is whether this would apply to all maintained schools. I am thinking of academies, which have a certain amount of freedom&#151;not to select parent governors, for example&#151;and their own ways of running things. Although that may not have any application regarding a council representing the views of students, equally it may. Would there be anything to impede a maintained school acting in this way?</p>

We do not want to regulate by statute in this area for the reasons set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, but we have given strong encouragement. I personally commissioned Professor Geoff Whitty two years ago to report to the Government on the issue of a pupil voice and participation. His report, which was published last September, sets out practical recommendations for how schools, including primary schools, can set up councils more effectively. Most primary schools now have councils&#151;it is not simply secondary schools. To take up the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, it also sets out other methods of engaging pupils in decision-making; for example, in consulting on behaviour policies in schools, and not simply by the more formal means of school councils.</p>

<a name="80701-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="080701122000203"></a>We support strongly School Councils UK, a voluntary organisation which provides guidance and assistance to schools in setting up councils, and we have just published new guidance entitled <I>Working Together: Listening to the voices of children and young people </I>on the whole range of issues to do with promoting a student voice in schools and the benefits of it. This is statutory guidance for schools. It has a section on young people and school councils which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87"></a><a name="080701122000276"></a>&#147;Among schools pupil or school councils are prized as a means of giving pupils a voice, developing their personal and social skills, enhancing the Citizenship curriculum and promoting the development of a school as a community. These councils can take many different forms in terms of their constitution and remit. To be effective, however, a council does need clear links to its school&#146;s senior management team and governing body, as well as mechanisms for involving all pupils in its work on an ongoing basis. This could include the use of a year group and class councils alongside a whole-school council&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701122000241"></a>And so it goes on. So there is a document which sets out advice and guidance in this area.</p>

<a name="80701-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="080701122000204"></a>As I say, we do not want to be unduly prescriptive. We believe, though, that the systematic engagement of pupils in decisions that affect them in the management of the school&#151;and there are none more important than the managing of behaviour and, in particular, how schools address this vexed issues of bullying&#151;school councils can have an important part to play and we have been active proponents of them. We do not think, however, that in primary legislation we should prescribe a rigid template for how school councils should be organised.</p>

It is now quite normal when I visit that one of the presentations made to me is by the school council.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000179"></a> Before Clause 80, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000181"></a>(1) Within 12 months of this Act receiving Royal Assent the Secretary of State must make regulations&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) requiring that all domestic buildings built after 2012 can function on a zero-carbon basis, and(b) making it mandatory to fit all buildings built after 2010 with appropriate renewable heating systems.<ul>

</ul>(a) their historic status,(b) excessive costs of insulation,(c) their short remaining life.&#148;
<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000008"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment tries to balance the Bill by bringing in a dimension that it is completely missing. The Government&#146;s White Paper on energy, published last year, flagged energy efficiency and energy savings as key parts of the way forward, yet they hardly feature in the Bill. In fact, it was very difficult to table amendments on this because the Long Title almost specifically excludes the area.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000009"></a>Before I describe the amendment, perhaps it would be useful to quote from the White Paper a few of many short sentences on energy saving. The executive summary on page 9 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000185"></a>&#147;The starting point for our energy policy is to save energy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000167"></a>On page 35, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000186"></a>&#147;Promoting policies to improve energy efficiency. This is the most cost effective means of tackling emissions while improving energy security&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000168"></a>On page 43, that is put in a European context:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000187"></a>&#147;Our priorities are to achieve the EU target of saving 20% of the EU&#146;s energy consumption by 2020 by improving energy efficiency across member states&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="080701103000169"></a>Finally, a more long-term view is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000188"></a>&#147;For the long-term we set out our commitment to raise the energy efficiency standards of our future building stock and of the products we buy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000170"></a>There is rightly a strong pledge at the forefront about how energy policy should be approached.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000010"></a>I remind the Minister and the Government that at the beginning of this parliamentary Session we were promised three Bills that would work together: the Climate Change Bill, which your Lordships&#146; House has already sent to the other place; the Planning Bill, which we still have to go through; and this Bill. They were to be the three legs of a stool that would make sure that we met the carbon and climate change commitments that we have made. Yet, important as parts of this Bill are, energy saving is left out. I entirely understand the view that some of this does not need to be in the Bill because the legislation already exists. That may be the case for some of these areas, although that does not usually stop Governments legislating.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000011"></a>I was interested to see some things that came out from previous programmes and legislation. On 2 April, Defra issued a press release entitled, &#147;Benn takes the fight against climate change into homes and communities&#148;. That is excellent, as that is exactly where it should go, but I was struck that having gone through the existing policy on building stock the press release stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000189"></a>&#147;It is estimated that once all the measures are installed under the scheme&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000171"></a>which will be over several years&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080701103000199"></a>&#147;which is being highlighted in adverts in national papers today&#151;it will save 4.2MtCO2/year&#151;the equivalent of removing 1.45 million cars from the road&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000172"></a>That is very impressive, but 4.2 million tonnes of CO2 is 0.7 per cent of our total carbon emissions, whereas domestic homes account for some 27 per cent of our carbon emissions and buildings as a whole account for some 50 per cent of our economy&#146;s emissions. The response that we have had in past legislation and the programmes that have come out of it are completely inadequate to fulfil the Government&#146;s objectives, which they rightly&#151;perhaps even courageously&#151;set in the Climate Change Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000012"></a>In the amendments, I want to take a leaf out of the Government&#146;s book again from the Climate Change Bill, where the big message is that we are not just making targets for carbon emissions but putting them on a statutory basis. What is an equivalent of that for energy? I would say the Government&#146;s pledge to have zero-carbon homes by 2016. There are two points on that. First, let us be equally courageous and put it into this Bill, so that we all have to do it; at the moment, industry is unclear and there is a fair bit of uncertainty about how that will be met. Secondly, let us bring the date forward, because 2016 is a long way away&#151;eight years. I seem to remember that the Government&#146;s target on house-building per annum is something around 200,000&#151;the Minister may put me right&#151;but let us say that that is rather optimistic and that we are actually looking at around 100,000. That means that we have getting on for a million new homes to be built between now and 2016 that are not zero-carbon, though we have that technology at the moment. Given the importance of energy and climate change, that is not  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good enough, so I have brought the date forward to 2012, which is much more realistic and something that both industry and planning authorities can cope with.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000013"></a>The amendment asks some rather more probing questions, as I want to hear the Minister&#146;s response to them. The Government have been successful in a number of areas to do with heating over the past five to seven years, particularly in community housing developments. They have found a financial way to help local authorities and housing associations to install the likes of heat pump technology in, particularly, affordable homes and homes for the elderly. It makes absolute sense that such technology be installed when houses are built and, when they are built in estates, that the whole estate is furnished with it. The extra capital cost at that stage is not that great but the benefits in reduced heating costs for the future are huge, and it has made a major contribution to fuel poverty. I congratulate the Government on those schemes. But why should it be the case with just those few instances? Should it not also be the responsibility in the private sector and all buildings, particularly for major domestic developments, that such technology be fitted now? Retrofitting is hugely expensive. The amendment does not say that there should not be other heating systems&#151;maybe there could be PV solar as well as heat pump&#151;but it is a major way in which we could move forward.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000014"></a>I read the statistic somewhere that by 2050&#151;one of the iconic dates in terms of climate change targets&#151; 95 per cent of existing buildings will still exist, so there is a great challenge to raise the efficiency of the existing housing stock. The Government are again rolling out a programme but it is minor in comparison with the need, hence why I say in the amendment that within 10 years we need to move all appropriate buildings up to category B on the energy performance certificates that the Government have recently introduced. Using that sort of currency&#151;the alphabet soup&#151;is a suitable way of doing that.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000015"></a>There are questions about how that is financed. I was trying to table an amendment to do with financing, but I could not do so as it was not seen as appropriate to the Bill. I tabled the amendment to tackle something that is fundamental to meeting the issues around climate change, energy reduction, our targets in Europe and fuel poverty. It is about investing now to make great gains in the future. One of the other areas that the White Paper clearly illustrates, like many other academic and business papers, is that investment in energy saving is by far the most productive means of saving energy and carbon in terms of a positive feedback of costs. It covers the cost automatically, even at commercial discounting rates, and it is the best way forward. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000016"></a><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080701103000211"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> The noble Lord has made a number of important points. Energy efficiency is probably the most positive thing of all that one can do; he is absolutely right on that. I have several reservations. First, if the amendment as it stands were accepted, what would it cost? Goodness knows. It is a very ambitious amendment. I do not know how realistic it is, but it aims in the right direction.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000017"></a>I have one specific point that applies to the United Kingdom, particularly those areas that have the greatest temperature variations&#151;the parts that are coldest and dampest in the winter. I do not know whether that is just north of the border; it probably applies to Wales as well. If you insulate old houses very well, you can get the most appalling condensation and damage. You cannot talk about insulation in a general way. That applies not only to large houses but particularly to small cottages. I have experience of that, and you have to be very careful about it.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000018"></a>The noble Lord has put exceptions to his great idea under proposed new subsection (4):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000190"></a>&#147;Buildings may be excluded on grounds including ... their historic status ... excessive costs of insulation ... their short remaining life&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000173"></a>Those are sensible exceptions. It is not practical for many old buildings, where you need to have a draught and a bit of circulation of the air. You do not need windows that are completely sealed. It is striking that for the cold countries of Europe, where the temperature drops and stays low all winter, such as Austria and Germany, total insulation is the correct thing to do, however old the house. You do not have the humidity or changes in temperature. It is an important point for us in this country to consider when talking about insulation. Local authorities probably know that very well in local areas, particularly where the temperatures very much vary. Just as with roads, we have to allow for changing temperatures in this country, and we treat them in winter quite differently to the approach in central Europe, and that applies to housing.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000019"></a><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080701103000212"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, made many extremely good points. One or two things about the amendment slightly worry me. Having just put in an eco carbon-based system in my house in the Borders of Scotland, I am still slightly fussed about the muddled thinking that there is on what carbon saving is and what the right thing to do is. Perhaps we need a little more explanation on the right thing for the right house. Obviously, on a new build, one would have to go through the pros and cons of a geothermal basis or an air source pump. I am slightly worried that we all should be much better educated on the right thing to do in the right zero-carbon situation.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000020"></a>On the whole, this amendment makes enormous sense. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Certainly, living in the type of house that I live in, one needs the odd draught to keep the air circulating throughout. By and large, I support this amendment.</p>

One should bear in mind the parallel with the Government&#146;s proposals for eco-towns, which all sounded very splendid when they first came out. However, one now reads reports from planning officers, experts and others, and one headline, for example, states that &#147;An eco-town on a greenfield site is inherently unsustainable&#148;. One has to be extremely careful and think these things through before putting them on the statute book. I suspect that eco-towns will be dealt with in the Planning Bill rather  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than here. But that is just an example of unintended consequences. While I admire the ambitions of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, in this regard, perhaps they are a bit unrealistic.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000022"></a><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080701103000214"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, on drafting this very interesting amendment. In many ways, it is extremely tempting, but on behalf of the Government I have to resist that temptation for reasons he may well understand. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, for her comments, particularly those about old houses and condensation. It only goes to show that nothing is simple in this field.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000023"></a>Amendment No. 63C seeks to add a new clause to the Bill, introducing very imposing and, as has been rightly described by others, ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions from any new dwellings to net zero by 2012 and to require the installation of renewable heating systems in all new dwellings built after 2010. On a longer timescale the amendment also seeks to improve the energy efficiency of all existing domestic, commercial, public and industrial buildings.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is right. This is a crucial and vital agenda. One can understand absolutely the sense of urgency in his amendment and in the way in which he moved it. The phrase was used that he was aiming in the right direction, and we agree. He mentioned the figure of 27 per cent. It is true that emissions from the domestic housing sector account for around that sum in the UK and emissions from the non-domestic sector are around 18 per cent. The decarbonisation of the built environment is an essential part of the transition to a low-carbon economy, and to meeting the Government&#146;s long-term emissions reductions targets in 2020 and 2050.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000025"></a>The noble Lord made the point that energy efficiency is not in this Bill. We, of course, agree that saving energy is critical to the success of climate change policy and energy security policy, but we do not believe that we need new primary legislation to achieve this, which I think he rather anticipated that I would say. If it is not necessary in a Bill, it is right that the Government should not put it in just for the sake of it. We cannot support the amendment for a number of reasons. Before I explain our position, perhaps I may briefly outline what we are already doing to reduce emissions from our homes and buildings.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000026"></a>As the Committee will know, in 2006, we set out a 10-year timetable towards a target that all new homes will be built to zero-carbon standards. This will be achieved through a step-by-step tightening of the building regulations in 2010, 2013 and 2016. It is our ambition, too, that all new non-domestic buildings be zero-carbon. Both these issues will be the subject of government consultations soon, and I will come back to that.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000027"></a>We recognise that targets are not enough. We have made it mandatory from 1 May, exactly two months ago, for all new homes to be rated against the <I>Code for S</I><I>ustainable </I><I>H</I><I>omes</I>. The Government have also introduced a stamp duty land tax relief scheme available to zero-carbon homes built today. These measures will increase awareness, at least, of the importance of energy efficiency in new homes, and give both developers and buyers the incentives to make the upfront investments in  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>low-carbon homes. We realise that just to focus on new homes is not possible; indeed, the big prize in terms of carbon savings will come from the existing stock. Our estimation or expectation is that by 2050 70 per cent of the housing stock will already be in existence today. That is why we have introduced an ambitious package of measures across all sectors to reduce energy use. We will hear more on this later, of course, but the carbon emissions reduction target between 2008 and 2011 will lead to some &#163;2.8 billion investment by energy suppliers in the energy efficiency of households. But there is still scope to do more across all sectors, hence we will consult later this year on the potential for further energy efficiency measures, especially in the existing housing stock, with our intention to introduce policies so that every sector of the economy benefits from energy efficiency.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000028"></a>The noble Lord said that the Government needed to do more to drive household energy efficiency, and we agree with him; we know that we need to do more, both to enhance delivery of existing schemes and to introduce new policies, if we are to meet the challenging energy and climate targets that we have set ourselves. That is why the Prime Minister announced last week, via the renewable energy strategy, a review of energy efficiency, with a public consultation this autumn and a revised energy efficiency strategy to be published in 2009.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000029"></a>Why can we not support the amendment? First, accepting the amendment would be premature. We will consult on how to achieve the target for all new homes to be zero-carbon from 2016. This consultation will include a definition of what developers will have to do to build zero-carbon homes, for example, including the extent to which on-site renewable generation will be required. This is a very important issue; the definition must be ambitious but also achievable. For example, some dwellings, such as city infill, have only a limited capacity for on-site generation, so too strict a definition could effectively preclude such developments, which would be undesirable from a social and indeed environmental perspective. To put our target in legislation before we have fully considered the practical implications could lead to unintended consequences and, in fact, a constraint on our actual ability to deliver affordable and sustainable housing. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, hinted at that point, although I cannot for a moment accept his comments on the proposed eco-towns. I am extremely disappointed to see that the Opposition&#151;not the noble Lord, but his Front Bench&#151;have just changed completely in their attitude towards such towns. I am interested to know where the Liberal Democrats stand on that issue, too.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000030"></a>We believe that the amendment is unnecessary. When I first got to my feet, I said that we saw the zero-carbon homes target being achieved through a progressive tightening of the building regulations. These are made under powers provided by the Building Act 1984. Therefore, the statutory underpinning for this initiative is already in place.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000031"></a>Our third reason is that our 2016 target is pretty ambitious and, indeed, world-leading in terms of the pace and scale of the challenge. It is not to be underestimated. Such a revolution in building design  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requires new mindsets, new technologies, new markets and new supply chains&#151;changes that we are already seeing due to the ambition of that target, but these changes cannot happen overnight. The amendment reduces by nearly half the time that we believe is realistic to allow for such developments to take place. Again, we fear the practical consequences that this may simply increase the costs&#151;a point made by the noble Baroness&#151;and reduce the actual delivery of zero-carbon homes.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000032"></a>We must be particularly careful to avoid short-term measures that impose unnecessary costs, particularly in the current economic climate, where the building and housing sectors are already facing significant problems. The construction industry, to its credit, has so far broadly supported the 2016 target and has engaged, pretty actively, in the forthcoming consultation. But we know that they are of course concerned about the additional costs. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, might agree, it is indisputable that the upfront costs of zero-carbon buildings are high. It is estimated that a home rated level 6 on the <I>Code for Sustainable Homes</I> could cost as much as 10 to 20 per cent more to build than homes built to the current building regulations standards. When rapidly increasing our policy ambitions, we must not lose sight of this.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000033"></a>I move briefly on to the other elements of the amendment. We also have concerns about the mandating of renewable heating systems in all new homes from 2010. This is a pretty restrictive requirement to impose in such a short timeframe. As I have said, the Government set out in the renewables consultation last week measures to promote more renewable heat, but everyone knows that this is a complex issue. Unlike electricity, there is no single market where heat is bought and sold. Indeed, the heat market primarily consists of suppliers of fuels, equipment and services.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000034"></a>Different heat technologies, both renewable and low-carbon, carry different practical and cost issues. For example, some renewable heat technologies, such as biomass, come with significant other sustainability considerations in terms of supply and air quality, as the Committee has heard, and are not appropriate in all homes or locations. Consequently, we think that it would be inappropriate to impose such a blanket requirement as this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000035"></a>Finally, I cannot support the requirement to introduce a programme to upgrade existing domestic, commercial, public and industrial buildings to a minimum energy efficiency rating of B within a 10-year period. We know that we need to make substantial reductions in the carbon footprint of existing buildings. We have a series of existing policies to achieve this&#151;I have mentioned CERT and let me mention the carbon reduction commitment too&#151;and we will consult later this year on the potential for further measures.</p>

The reality is that the options available and the costs are totally dependent on the nature of the buildings in question, so to apply a one-size-fits-all standard in all situations is not appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000038"></a>Although I cannot accept the amendment, I am very grateful to the noble Lord for allowing a discussion to take place around this vital subject. I hope that I have been able to explain the importance that the Government attribute to these issues, but equally why we feel that the amendment cannot be supported. Instead, we believe that our targets and consultations are the preferable place and opportunity to take forward this very important debate.</p>

He referred to the consultation papers that are coming and also to the fact, which is often omitted, that these things involve costs. Many of these green initiatives make things more expensive. Can he assure us that the consultation papers will do their best&#151;I recognise his argument about the one-size-fits-all concept not being appropriate&#151;to indicate the costs of the measures? How much more expensive will a house be, and how much more expensive will it be for the occupiers of a house who will have to incur the necessary capital expenditure? Without that coming into the equation, it is very difficult to judge the validity of the policy.</p>

This is a key issue. Perhaps I could respond to a few of the comments. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I say that this amendment tries to do exactly the opposite to what eco-towns are trying to do; it is trying not to apply perfection to a limited number of instances dotted around the country, but to mainstream and roll out these standards within existing and living communities. I see it as the antidote to the eco-town syndrome. That is one of the main reasons for putting it this way.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000042"></a>As regards costs, I do not in any way minimise the issue. In Committee, it is probably in order to have an &#147;ambitious&#148; amendment. Through the debate that we have had, one can reconsider how the amendment might be written for a further stage. I point out that, following on from other work, on page 286 of the government White Paper is what is known as the marginal abatement cost curve. It gives all the different technologies and how they are able to help as regards

A number of them are negative costs: they have positive benefits rather than being costs themselves. Three of those&#151;the largest in terms of savings&#151;happen to be standard insulation, domestic heating measures and solid wall insulation. All those are known as negative costs. It cannot be beyond the wit of the financial community to find ways in which we can financially engineer those to make sense as regards today's capital costs, whether that be through green mortgages, council tax, property tax, benefits or what I want to see in the longer term, which are revenues from carbon auctions. I agree that the costing is an issue, but there are ways around that and the benefits and the paybacks are good. That graph was probably created when oil prices or energy prices were half what they are today.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000043"></a>I understand the Minister&#146;s issues around existing and future legislation, but there is no better way of putting your actions where your mouth is than to put them in the Bill. I understand the issue about condensation. In my area of the far south-west we have issues such as radon gas. We have to ensure that properties are well ventilated for all sorts of reasons. Again, the technology allows ventilation as well as thermal efficiency. Through building regulations and technology, I think that can be done.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000049"></a>The noble Lord said: It is worth rehearsing the history of the amendment, because there is a somewhat misguided exclusion in the Bill. Some Members of the Committee will remember the Energy Bill of March 2004, when this House voted in support of an amendment to impose a legal duty on the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="080701103000200"></a>&#147;ensure the integrity and security of gas and electricity supplies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000174"></a>I remember that clearly; it was my amendment. It went to a Division and was carried with a majority of two, but then went to the other House, where it stood as Clause 1 within a new Part 1 of the Energy Bill. The Government resisted the amendment during the later Commons proceedings, arguing that a legal duty would make ad hoc government intervention more likely and undermine the independence of Ofgem. Therefore they introduced an alternative, which another place supported&#151;a clause to establish an annual reporting framework, saying that it would secure greater public and political transparency for the longer term prospects of security of supply. In the proceedings on this Bill, we have dealt at some length with security. That alternative was then accepted by this House and became Section 172 of the Energy Act 2004. It is that section that Clause 80(3) seeks to remove.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000050"></a>It is worth looking at Section 172. It requires the Secretary of State to publish and lay before Parliament a report every year on the availability of gas and electricity for meeting all reasonable consumer demands. In other words, the section imposes an annual statutory reporting requirement on the Government in relation to the security of the country&#146;s energy supplies. In a little more detail, the section stipulates that the annual report must be prepared jointly by what is now BERR and Ofgem. It must deal with both the short-term and the long-term view and cover, in particular, electricity generating capacity, the availability of capacity in electricity transmission and distribution, the availability of capacity in licensed gas pipeline systems, and the availability of capacity in gas infrastructure.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000051"></a>That annual report, which the Government are required by law to lay before Parliament, is an important mechanism for reflecting both a strong public and political interest in the provision of secure energy supplies and the reality that, if markets are to continue to deliver security, they must be able to receive and share as much information as possible&#151;a point made in the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, recently circulated.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000052"></a>The reason given by BERR for wanting to delete Section 172&#151;it is set out in the Explanatory Notes&#151;is that it overlaps with reporting requirements imposed by the EU electricity and gas liberalisation directives of June 2003. A problem with that immediately strikes one&#151;2003 was before 2004, so the directives already existed. The Government introduced Section 172 in the other place and it became law here so, if the directives were more important and made it unnecessary, why did they do so? There would have been no need to enact Section 172 in the first place. However, a more important point is that the requirements of the articles in the European directives are neither as specific nor as strong as those in Section 172. Looking at a direct comparison of the drafting&#151;I shall not weary noble Lords with that&#151;makes that clear.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000053"></a>In addition, the directives would allow BERR to pass the monitoring responsibility for security of energy supply to Ofgem, thus negating one of the purposes of Section 172 that I am sure that we all agree with: that the Government must ultimately take responsibility for such monitoring. Finally, deleting Section 172 in favour of the European directives would remove the Government&#146;s obligation to lay security of supply reports before Parliament and would allow the frequency of reports to be reduced from one to two years.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000054"></a>I suggest to the Committee that these are all unwelcome outcomes. Considerable fuss has been made about Clause 80(3) and the Government must think about it again. Given the history and the comparison of the European directives with Section 172, the section is valuable. It should remain on the statute book, and I hope that the Government might agree. I beg to move.</p>

Why are the Government keen to remove Section 172 of the Energy Act 2004? Are they trying to cut costs by doing so at this stage? The report is extremely valuable. Security of supply has changed year on year, and can change month on month, particularly with gas. I am reminded

First, the response to the last question is exactly as the noble Lord suggested&#151;other formats for reporting. We recognise the obligation for a report. I reassure the Committee that there is no intention to renege on that commitment, or to avoid reporting on security of supply. We want to do it another way and, in some respects, are now doing so. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated&#151;and I also recall the heady days of 2004&#151;the European directives which were implemented after Section 172 had been agreed by both Houses. We knew that we would be under the obligations, because the directives had been drafted in 2003 but were not for implementation until later.</p>

The noble Lord will recall that we spent many long hours on the passage of the Energy Bill 2004. As he identified, there was considerable debate about the now Section 172. The Government accepted the need for it, despite knowing that the European directive would need implementation shortly afterwards. Of course, the intention of removing Section 172 is not in any way, shape or form to dilute the Government&#146;s obligation to report on the security of energy supply. We merely seek to simplify and streamline the statutory reporting requirements.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000059"></a>There have been a number of developments since Section 172 was created. First, we are now required by Article 5 of the EU gas internal market directive and Article 4 of the EU electricity internal market directive to monitor gas and electricity security of supply issues and publish reports. These reports are required annually for gas, and every two years for electricity. The Section 172 requirement largely duplicates this EU requirement, and we consider it to be overtaken; we are not in any way, shape or form diluting the obligation.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000060"></a>We are pleased to see this amendment, because it demonstrates that the information now provided in the <I>E</I><I>nergy </I><I>M</I><I>arkets </I><I>O</I><I>utlook</I> and to other sources is of great interest, relevance and importance to the industry. We are well aware of the industry&#146;s anxieties in these areas, which the noble Lord has reflected. I reassure the Committee that we intend to continue to fulfil the requirement of reporting. Our intention with this clause is simply to streamline statutory reporting requirements, removing unnecessary duplication and creating a framework for reporting that is less prescriptive and more responsive to need. Although I do not think that we need a Section 172 of the Energy Act, I have listened to what the noble Lord has said this afternoon with the greatest care. In view of the strength of

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000069"></a>The amendment&#146;s purpose is incredibly simple. The Government&#146;s having added the section on smart metering in Clause 81 has set out an interesting way forward to deal with smart metering but not given any indication of when that obligation should be met and fully exercised. Smart metering has exercised a great deal of time of those who have been lobbied on the issue for a number of years; many of us believe that it is a valuable tool, not just for the industry but for the consumer&#151;a point that should not be forgotten. This issue could have a realistic effect on fuel poverty and help many consumers deal with the use of electricity in the home. It would also be a fantastic boon for those who have the major difficulty of having meters read on a regular basis. I speak as someone whose meter is in the cellar and I should install a light because I have fallen over a couple of times looking for it, which is a nightmare. It is a major problem for old people who find it difficult to access their meters, especially if they are not read on a regular basis and there could be problems  with the bills. Of course, smart metering would deal with that.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000070"></a>However, the Government, having brought forward this most welcome part of the Bill, have failed in their duty to say when this purpose should be completed. We are talking about a massive investment running into billions of pounds. Once the consultation period has been undertaken and the type of smart metering is worked out, we are talking about a system that will cause an enormous amount of effort throughout the country. All premises will be affected and the papers will be full of stories about whether the meters have been installed correctly. There will be a great deal of problems. Of course, there will also be the fiscal problems of taking this forward. That is why a 10-year period should be considered. This is such a large project that it could go on indefinitely. Therefore, while the system may start in the next two or three years, the overrun may mean that many properties do not deal with such meters for 15 or 20 years. This issue feeds into the debates we have already had on feed-in tariffs before we get smart meters; they will be much more difficult to implement.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000071"></a>On waste, we are talking about the environmental implications of not moving forward to zero-carbon-rated homes. I am always very worried about figures that cannot be justified, but there was talk of 10,000 meters being installed each week, each day or each month&#151;I am not sure which, but an enormous number of meters are installed around the country on a daily basis. Obviously, that is part of the ongoing maintenance programme, but it will be very annoying and costly to the environment if meters are installed over the next two or three years only to be ripped out and replaced by smart meters a short time later. There are also cost implications for the people having them installed and the companies which have to install them.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000072"></a>All we are asking is for the Government to go one step further. They have done the hard work in talking about bringing forward a consultation period to come up with the type of smart meters to be installed. We want to make sure that the end date is in sight, so that the companies can gear the considerable finances and the risk factor to fit within an acceptable timescale. We believe that 10 years is not too short a time in which this process can be undertaken. However, the big problem is that the directions set out give no start date by which the majority of the work should be started. An end date would focus not just the Government&#146;s mind, but also the minds of industry, on when the majority of the work must be completed and on making sure that they have an objective in mind for its completion.

It needs a timeframe; without one, there is no imperative for the policy to get off the ground. I am grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. It is typical of Government to seize a good idea, pursue it only up to a point, and then omit the factor that will deliver the goods. Not having a timeframe is a poison pill to these proposals. The fact that the Government have put into law that they will do this eventually is simply not enough. The technology for smart meters has been around for some years. What is needed is a firm directive on a transparent timescale.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000075"></a>If the Government expect industry to get on board with rolling out smart meters, it is essential that the industry participants know when they will be expected to act. Clear direction is vital. The Minister will surely appreciate that businesses&#146; plans will have to be formulated to incorporate the new clauses which the Government have introduced. Yet without knowing when those powers are to be used, businesses will not be able to budget for the future. Without that direction, a smart metering policy is, as I have said, at risk of falling apart. If the Government want to take action, they should be clear about when they will do so.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000076"></a>Now that the House is in agreement on the virtues of smart meters, why should there be any delay? We expect that there will need to be further consultation on the exact way in which smart meters will be rolled out. One year should be more than ample to discover such methods. Our Amendment No. 69 would mandate the Secretary of State to use those powers within one year, giving the necessary direction to industry to get the ball rolling towards universal smart meters.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000077"></a>I would like to pose the first of two questions to the Minister. Will he give a clear undertaking that these powers will be used within one year, or indeed give a firm commitment to industry and accept our amendment? As I mentioned before, it is satisfying to see the Government beginning to take steps towards a smart-meter policy yet, without clarification and some courage, we fear that those devices might never reach the people who stand to benefit from them.</p>

From what the two opposition parties have said, as yet we do not know how many meters are required. I would have thought that would be the first thing that we should be told. My understanding is that there are something like 24 million domestic households in the United Kingdom&#151;perhaps not; let us say that there are 18 million gas meters and 24 million electric ones. That is what we are talking about. I was working on the basis of 25 million. Let us say it was 25 million: over 10 years that is 2.5 million a year, which is 50,000 a week and 7,000 a day. I am not sure that, at the moment, British industry is geared up to do that kind of work.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000081"></a>My point is that, at the moment, the Energy Retail Association members have been arm-wrestling among themselves for the best part of about nine months and have failed to come up with a scheme to which all their members will sign up. The utilities do not really know what they are doing and at the same time are continuing to install the old meters because they need to be put in for safety purposes and other reasons. We have a problem but it is rather complex. Do we start at the end we have just arrived at where there are new meters, do we go to the oldest ones, or do we go to the ones in between which are just about to be done? Each company has a different set of priorities; each has a different set of ambitions about where they want to start and how they want to do it. Therefore, at the moment, it is very dangerous&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080701103000082"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080701103000231"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> All sides of the House have been lobbied on this by the major retailers and suppliers. They cannot decide what to put in until the government consultation, which will decide what type of meters are to be put in, has taken place. Nobody would risk putting in meters that might not meet whatever is set out in the government consultation. The noble Lord made a point about 7,000 units being put in a day. The industry does not think there is a problem with installing all the meters; it is a question of when it is going to be given the go-ahead to start that installation.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000083"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080701103000232"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I still come back to the point that I made earlier: noble Lords may have been lobbied, but they should ask the people doing the lobbying how they want to do things. We no longer live in a state capitalist society where the Government lay down doctrines. They may lay down doctrines about safety and supply, but not about detailed issues of the kind suggested. At the moment, as far as I understand it, the Energy Retail Association is at sixes and sevens on this, not because the Government have not told it what to do, but because the individual utilities cannot decide on the priorities or the kit, and at this stage they cannot make a unified expression of opinion to the Government about what they recognise as the best kit. I have been extremely inadequately lobbied by some of these people. The Government may well have to grab them by the scruff of the neck, but plucking figures out of the air at this stage is very dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000084"></a>Equally, we have to have an idea of whether we are doing gas and electricity and whether people want workmen traipsing through their homes to do both at one time, which will have to be the case in a number of houses. If we are enjoying the benefits and discounts of dual billing, I imagine people would like to have both meters smart simultaneously, but I am not sure whether gas is as easy to be smart with as electricity. This subject is a lot more complicated than this rather simplistic amendment suggests, particularly when neither opposition party has taken the trouble to try to give us any quantification of the scale of the exercise. We have been told that 7,000 may be possible a day. That is fine, but it is incumbent on them to deal with the quantum of this problem in a rather better organised way than

In itself, it may be desirable, but in its present form it is not nearly well enough argued and does not have the specifics that we require.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000085"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080701103000233"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a></b>It may be some time since the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan, was in opposition, but he deludes himself if he imagines that an opposition party, with whatever advice it may get from experts, could conceivably commit itself to the details of a programme of this sort. What it can commit itself to is to saying that the most speedy advance of smart meters is something that should have a high policy priority. In government, it would rely on the advice that would be available from the department and the officials it would inherit to decide the best way. A great deal of work has been done.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000086"></a>I thought that the consultation paper published in August last year was extremely good. It was immensely thorough and went into a great many of the issues. It is not surprising that as a result, the Government are taking a bit of time to decide what to do. There have been a number of things since then. The Minister, Malcolm Wicks, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000194"></a>&#147;I should say that our intention is to report our work on these analyses to the House by the end of the year&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 30/4/08; col. 335.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701103000176"></a>If that is the Government&#146;s intention, what is wrong with having 12 months from the passing of the Bill? If anything, that is a rather less stringent obligation. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, knows that. On talking to the experts, I was intrigued to find that the latest models can do both gas and electricity in the same meter. My immediate reaction was to ask, &#147;What happens if there is a spark in one?&#148;. &#147;They can look after that&#148;, they said. For those of us who have both gas and electricity, such a meter would obviously be an advantage.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000087"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="080701103000234"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I am told that they even do water as well. The problem is that it is too complicated. Too many things can go wrong. That is why people are very cautious about advocating even a dual-fuel meter.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000088"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="080701103000235"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I am perfectly happy to leave my water meter where it can be read by the people who come in. Whether eventually it could be read remotely is another question.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000089"></a>There are huge advantages if we can move to this. I am impressed by the case made by the Energy Retail Association that this really is one of its highest priorities. It needs a mandate from the Government. That word is increasingly used and I suspect that the Government will eventually want to give one. It is not a question of detailing what should be done; there are arguments about whether each region should have a monopoly supplier. I would be opposed to that, but let us hear all the arguments. Certainly there should not be single designs and that sort of thing because the market is very capable of producing innovative designs, as indeed they currently are. Before anybody can move ahead, a mandate that this has a priority is needed from the Government.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000090"></a>The letter I had from Ofgem talks about managing trials of smart meters in more than 15,000 households. My electricity supplier asked if I would join such a trial. Do you know what happened? Because my electricity meter is available for the meter reader in a cupboard on my porch I was told that I could not take part. I wrote back and said, &#147;Why on earth not?&#148;. I think they probably thought their meter was going to be too valuable and might be nicked. I am not sure that I would want to try to nick somebody else&#146;s electricity meter; it might be rather dangerous. I was disappointed not to be able to take part in the trial that had been offered.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000091"></a>These things are happening. If the Government give a mandate and there is a swift advance in the introduction of smart meters, that that will have enormous advantages for consumers, and not just through having an instant reading and a dial which can tell them what is happening. It is far more than that; it is being able to have a lot more sophisticated supply arrangements, remote readings and a whole range of things like that&#151;I will not go into all the details. But it does seem to me that, putting it rather crudely, the Government have got to get on with it. That is what my noble friend on the Front Bench is asking for in the amendment, to which I put my name. We must have the Government&#146;s response to this within 12 months of the Bill becoming an Act. Given what Mr Wicks said on Report in another place, I should have thought that this was something the Government would be perfectly prepared to accept. It may not be properly drafted, but it seems to me that it is perfectly proper for Parliament to ask for this. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000092"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="080701103000236"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> I, too, support the amendment, primarily for the reason I gave at Second Reading that I feel that one of the major criticisms of the Bill is the lack of a sense of urgency. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, about the precise date of what can be done by a particular time. If the amendment is carried and if it is necessary at a later stage to put in a different date, so be it. It is worth bearing in mind that the new smart meters are likely to be significantly less expensive and faster to fit than the conventional meters we know and love.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000093"></a>Finally, it is worth pointing out that the provision of smart meters has an important bearing on another part of the Government&#146;s, and I hope the country&#146;s, agenda&#151;identifying fuel poverty. One can see in real time what is not happening and take action.</p>

We recognise that the Government are under pressure to get on with it, but getting on with it is part of this legislation. If the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will forgive me, there is a difference between getting on with it and the Government&#146;s ability to progress with this as rapidly  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as we are able, bearing in mind the difficulty of the task, and writing into the Bill time constraints that may not be entirely realistic.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000096"></a>What my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, said is absolutely right. There are real complexities and massive costs involved in this issue. I want to identify that the Government are at one with those who emphasise the potential gains from smart metering. We are able in certain instances to identify those gains and we intend to act on them forthwith. But we are less certain about some aspects of the wider propositions involved in these amendments, and we are asking the Committee to recognise the Government&#146;s inevitable caution around some aspects that the Committee is asking us to consider under the amendments.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000097"></a>The amendments specify in legislation a 10-year period for a smart meter rollout, including domestic customers&#151;and of course this is a crucial issue. From the many contributions on the issue during Second Reading, we were clear that there was agreement about the potential benefits of smart meters for both consumers and energy suppliers. Of course, the government response indicated our awareness of that fact, which is why we set out our expectations in relation to smart meters in the energy White Paper last year. We have worked since towards a decision point. I am responding to those who in their contributions this afternoon have stressed the issue of urgency and that a decision is necessary. Later this year we will look at the issues of full rollout, including the domestic sector. But I hope that the Committee, following the speech of my noble friend and bearing in mind the points that I shall now make, will not underestimate just how complex, challenging and costly a rollout of smart meters to all energy consumers would be.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000098"></a>Before I turn to the specific amendments, which I shall deal with in some detail, I shall respond to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, made&#151;that it is about time that the Government set out their position on the question of smart meters. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, we have all been involved in some very intensive analysis ever since the consultation paper, to which he kindly referred in generous terms, was presented last year. Our analysis has confirmed that there is a positive business case for proceeding with smart metering for the medium-sized business sector. Of course, we made provision with reference to that in the 2008 Budget&#151;that we would mandate the rollout over the next five years. We will consult on the draft modified licence conditions shortly. Once that process is complete, the Bill will underpin that rollout.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000099"></a>That is action this year, taken on the basis of the budgetary position that we established for the medium-sized business sector. That involves 210,000 meters&#151;a sizeable number. But the commitment is there.</p>

That commitment was given, but it is not a statutory commitment in the Bill. Clause 81(5) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000195"></a>&#147;The power conferred by subsection (1) may not be exercised after the end of a period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that subsection comes into force&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000177"></a>If you read the analysis of the Bill, which is the statutory requirement, it means that the whole process might not start for five years from the enactment of the Bill, and that is a considerable worry. Perhaps the Minister can say that it is not the intention of the Government to use that entire five years but, in the statutory provision, five years is what the Government are giving themselves.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000101"></a><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew19"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0003.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="080701103000240"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Five years is not a constraint; it is a period within which action will be taken. I am indicating to the noble Lord the steps that we are taking regarding the medium-sized business sector, so that we can be in a position to progress quickly, as the Committee is suggesting.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000102"></a>I emphasise that the issues are infinitely greater than that, particularly when it comes to the domestic sector. There is a case for a rollout of smart meters to small business. This is a complex area, and it is necessary that the Government do the analysis thoroughly because, as the noble Lord was generous enough to recognise when he proposed the amendment, there are substantial costs involved. I will indicate our version of those costs, which I assure the noble Lord is not to minimise the problem.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000103"></a>Our initial analysis of the costs and benefits, which is in the process of being tested, includes further work with stakeholders to ensure that it is robust, before making final policy decisions. Again, the powers in this Bill would underpin this rollout, should we proceed. Regarding small business, we are talking about 2.4 million meters, and 210,000 meters for medium-sized business. In answer to the estimates that my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill gave when he was identifying the dimensions for the domestic sector, we consider that there would be 47 million meters involved, affecting every home in the United Kingdom. The difference between that and the 170,000 electricity meters and 40,000 gas meters that are needed for medium-sized business are obviously enormous.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000104"></a>On our present analysis, there is not a positive business case for proceeding with a domestic rollout. The current estimated costs for domestic rollout are in the range of &#163;8 billion to &#163;14 billion over 20 years, and there is uncertainty about the expected benefits. By any stretch of the imagination, those are very substantial sums of money indeed. That is why the Government are right to proceed with that necessary caution, which involves us in doing a full cost-benefit analysis of those concepts.</p>

However, with such substantial sums involved, and my noble friend&#146;s contribution being a hypothesis rather than a taken fact, it is only right that the Government subject it to serious analysis. When we talk of the benefits of any rollout and the meters, we are taking his point into account: there may be greater energy efficiency because individuals becoming more aware of the costs will moderate their use accordingly.</p>

I presume that they are smart meters. I cannot show it here, but abatement costs are below the line: the Government declare it to be a positive return in this paper, whereas offshore wind is hugely more expensive per ton of carbon. Again, however, this is all against the energy crisis of a year ago&#151;but from what I can see of it, the Government have already argued our case.</p>

Companies may well find that consumers want to buy these meters because they will save money and will find it enormously helpful. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is absolutely right: this will be a big issue and the Government are not up to speed on it at all. We are getting a very laid-back reply. There may be an argument against 10 years; I am not in a position to know that. However, the companies will be alert to this and want to do it as quickly as possible. They are also less likely to have bad debts with smart meters; they will get their money more easily, which would be another imperative.</p>

By extension, we are bound to have even greater necessity for analysing whether some of the costs might be paid by the householder, who would see the benefits of paying for the meter. That would be an additional step in the analysis of the economic case. I say to the noble Baroness that we have not completed all this work.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000110"></a>The Committee must recognise that this is an exceedingly complex area, which the Government must get right. We are persuaded of the cost-benefit analysis for medium-sized business and intend to proceed on that as quickly as possible. I have indicated that small-sized business is a much bigger problem, and we have further work to do there. The costs involved for the domestic user, however, are enormous. Before the Government can commit to a programme of billions of pounds, we must be as certain as possible of the proposal&#146;s cost-benefit analysis. That is why intensive work has to be done, particularly against the background of high energy prices. It is right that, with the costs involved, the Government should ensure that they have the nation&#146;s confidence in rolling out this programme, rather than back-of-the-envelope calculations.</p>

However, we are not just talking about the costs to the consumer. One great benefit of smart meters&#151;and of course it is an issue about the type of smart meter that has caused such controversy&#151;is that there is enormous benefit to the supplier in producing them. All those people who knock on your door on a regular basis at inconvenient times because they know you are going to be in at that point&#151;it always happens when I am bathing the kids&#151;will no longer have to go from door to door. That is a massive saving and cost benefit to the companies. But it is not just a cost benefit to the companies. As the Minister says, there is then a value in that, if they are taking that cost base out of the equation, the cost is not then passed on to the consumer who buys the electricity supplies.</p>

He will forgive me if I do not try to reply to the debate by listing the potential benefits that the Government have analysed so far. Without figures that would be meaningless. Any lists that I provide to the Committee would not be exhaustive, such are the fertile minds of a number of noble Lords. I am bound to be open to that challenge. I merely say to the noble Lord that surely he can recognise that with the magnitude of necessary investment regarding the domestic rollout, the Government have to ensure that their cost-benefit analysis on the potential product is as adequate as possible, given all the uncertainties involved. We have initiatives which are helping us. The Energy Demand Research Project will complete its work in November of this year. We would not conceive of being able to reach a decision on these issues until that report has been considered.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000113"></a>I owe both noble Lords the courtesy of addressing their specific amendments. There was bound to be a contextual debate about this very difficult issue. I hope that I have clarified some of those issues, while indicating that the Government are considering these matters as the Committee in broad terms suggests, although the amendments are rather more ambitious and contain dimensions which I am not prepared to accept.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000114"></a>Amendment No. 68 seeks to ensure that licence modifications must take effect within a 10-year period of the Act being passed. Amendment No. 69 seeks to specify a 12-month period within which regulations must be made and to ensure that a domestic rollout of smart meters takes place over 10 years. As I have indicated in my earlier remarks, I am not unsympathetic&#151;far from it&#151;to the objectives. The Government share the broad proposition that, if we can introduce smart meters, there are potentially considerable gains. We have a large programme of work under way to examine exactly the kinds of issues raised by the amendments. I hope that the Committee will agree that we cannot proceed on just the belief that the benefits are bound to outweigh the costs. We must have more than just a belief; we must make this decision based on real evidence.</p>

I do not see that our approach is unsupportive of smart metering&#151;quite the opposite. The best way of delivering certainty to business, as several Members of the Committee have emphasised, is that business needs to know what government strategy is to plan the necessary investment and to meet the demands of the community. The best way to deliver certainty to business would be to take decisions on our policy and the detail of a smart meter rollout against the backdrop of a thorough analysis of the costs and benefits. We are not in that position yet. The clauses are consistent with the approach that, of course, we are looking seriously at the potential benefits of smart metering, but details such as the timescale of a rollout will be set out in modified licensed conditions or other industry documents rather than on the face of the Bill, which surely would be premature.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000116"></a>Technical issues in the energy sector are not new. Generally, it is the case that we do not put technical factors in the legislation. We recognise their complexity and it is the responsibility of Government to work their way through those issues. The advantage of not having it in primary legislation is that we have a degree of flexibility to decide the details of a rollout and implement the licensing and other arrangements in this regulatory area after we have taken final decisions and had an opportunity to identify the optimum, most cost-effective manner of rollout. Secondly, although we have completed a very considerable amount of work on domestic rollout, it has raised a number of very real issues which require detailed analysis. That is why I hope that the Committee will recognise that it would not be right to specify issues on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000117"></a>We need to look comprehensively at the three key parameters of the project, which are meter functionality, the speed at which rollout occurs and the model of rollout. Each has very significant implications for the overall costs and benefits of any rollout. As I have indicated to the Committee, the sums involved are very substantial indeed. It would be highly damaging in the long term if a premature decision were taken now to set one of these parameters in primary legislation before we fully understand the subsequent implications that that may have on the other parameters concerned. For example, the implication on the overall cost of fixing the parameters, such as timeframe, now, could deliver benefits&#151;I recognise the benefits from immediate action&#151;but it is quite possible that those benefits will be far outweighed by the overall costs of the project.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000118"></a>The clauses in the Bill set out to indicate that we will be able to act as quickly as possible to roll out smart meters to the small business and domestic sector once and if our final analysis supports that. If we proceed with domestic rollout, the detail, such as timetable and meter function, will be set out in the draft licence conditions. The powers in the Bill will ensure that there is further parliamentary scrutiny of the draft licence conditions, so the Government will be answerable in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000119"></a>I want to put on the record the fact that the clauses enable the modification of licence conditions. Amendment No. 69 refers to regulations which, in its current form, neither the existing power nor that amendment would

That is why I cannot accept the amendment. I hope have made it clear that the important issues raised within it are the types of issues we are examining now in the context of reaching&#151;I reinforce this point to the Committee&#151;final decisions later this year.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000124"></a>The Minister pointed out the difficulties associated with the consultation process, which we do not underestimate. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, gave the impression that we somehow thought that this is very easy matter of just taking the meter out of the box and installing it. I have been to a vast number of meetings, as the noble Lord probably has, looking at all the different options for what might be available within the cost ratio being looked at for smart meters. We believe that a timescale is important because it will have a massive effect on the cost implications and the cost benefits, which should not be underestimated, not just in cost to the consumer but in carbon saving, which was a major part of the Climate Change Bill and is another strand of government policy. I plan to come back to this issue at a later stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000127"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with two important areas in establishing the terms of a future smart meter rollout: stranding and the delivery model. Neither can be established until the impact assessment work, which the Minister discussed, has been completed by DBERR towards the end of the year; in an earlier question, we established that that is an elastic period. It is important that the Bill is amended in this way to ensure that no options are precluded before the decision-making process is completed.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000128"></a>The first subsection deals with stranding and the need to be able to compensate for the potential stranding costs that the industry&#151;in particular, network operators&#151;would face if the decision is taken to mandate an accelerated rollout of domestic smart meters. Although it was originally thought that existing provisions of gas and electricity legislation would deal adequately with this, a project of this scale is unprecedented. Closer examination has revealed an anomaly in  Section 7B(5)(a)(iii) of the gas legislation, meaning that only gas suppliers or shippers, rather than transporters who are most likely to be affected, can be compensated.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000129"></a>The second subsection is designed to strengthen the clauses to ensure that no delivery options are ruled out by the terms of the Bill before the completion of the impact assessment. Clause 81 is probably not legally good enough to support the regional franchise model&#151;at least, not without exposing the industry to a significant risk of challenge for infringement of competition law principles. The industry feels that there is sufficient doubt to justify a positive clarifying amendment to ensure that no rollout option should be precluded by the legal drafting. The industry is aware that more work must be done to complete the case for regional franchise model, but competition law precludes continuing this work.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000130"></a>If Clause 81 is not amended, the decision on the rollout suggests that there is a real possibility that the regional franchise model will be ruled out before proper consideration can be given to whether it is the right model. The industry feels that it is vital that the enabling clause does not presuppose the outcomes or restrict the scope of delivery of the smart meter rollout. I hope that the Minister sees the amendment as a clarifying one, so that the consultation can be undertaken without any one issue or other being ruled out. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000131"></a><a name="80701-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="080701103000252"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I certainly see the case for the first paragraph of the amendment. There is clearly an anomaly. As the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has said, if gas suppliers and shippers can be compensated for stranded assets&#151;that is, those that must be replaced before their life has expired&#151;that would be something. However, the people who will do this are described as the &#147;transporters&#148;: those who transport the gas from the suppliers to the consumers. If the clause is to have the effect that the Government intend, that is an important amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000132"></a>While I understand the case made for the second paragraph, I have already indicated that I dislike the regional franchise model on the whole. There may be some initial cost savings, but anything that smacks of a regional monopoly&#151;which it would&#151;would be a recipe for increasing slackness and a lack of proper

I accept that it may still be a model, in which case a paragraph is probably necessary in order not to rule it out. In suggesting, therefore, that the Government might be wise to accept the second paragraph, I would not like it to be thought that I am automatically supporting a regional franchise model. There may be some difficulties with that.</p>

<p><a name="080701103000133"></a><a name="80701-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="080701103000253"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for his amendment, which touches on what I agree are two important areas for any future rollout of smart meters: stranding and the choice of market model for a rollout. The first part of the amendment deals with stranding, which will occur in any smart meters rollout that is taken forward faster than on a new-and-replacement basis. As has been said, it would mean that existing meters would need to be removed before the end of their usual life cycle. There would be costs to both suppliers and meter providers.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000134"></a>The wording of the first part of the amendment makes explicit provision for the Secretary of State to amend licence conditions to raise a levy from gas transporters or electricity distributors which can then be paid to other licensees to compensate them for the cost of stranded assets in the event of an accelerated smart-meter rollout. It goes almost without saying that this is a complex issue, which we are closely examining with industry. As we discussed during the previous debate and as the Committee knows, we have not taken final decisions on whether to roll out smart meters to the domestic sector, and if so at what speed that rollout should happen. It is therefore not clear at this stage what the potential value of those stranded assets may be, as they will vary according to the specific details of any rollout and, in particular, the speed of the rollout.</p>
<h5><a name="080701103000207"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000135"></a>Different market actors will be affected differentially. The potential cost impact of stranding is not spread equally across the industry. We need to continue to consider how to address this problem. It is also important to note that how we deal with stranded assets will affect the costs of a smart-metering rollout and it is likely in all scenarios that these additional costs will eventually be borne by the consumer. Until we have decided our overall approach on stranding, it is too early to say whether such a mechanism as the one proposed in the amendment will be necessary or even appropriate.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000136"></a>Given the complexity of this issue we have asked Ofgem to conduct a detailed analysis of stranding, which obviously will feed into our broader analysis of a rollout of smart meters. We cannot take a detailed view on the most appropriate way forward until that assessment is complete&#151;it is due in September 2008. We are also examining whether powers under existing legislation&#151;for instance, there may be some overlap with existing powers available to Ofgem under the gas and electricity Acts to raise levies&#151;could provide for the type of mechanism proposed in this amendment if we should decide such a mechanism is necessary.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000137"></a>I concede, of course, that the second part of the amendment touches on another key issue; that is, the market framework for any such rollout. We have already  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discussed that a universal rollout of smart meters to domestic customers would be a major undertaking. It goes without saying that it would require a visit to every household and the replacement of some 47 million electricity and gas meters, a figure which has already been given. Various approaches have been proposed for the practical and logistical delivery of such a project.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000138"></a>Proposals have been made by some stakeholders for changes to the existing competitive metering market, which also is an important element of our ongoing work to assess the costs and benefits of a rollout. This work involves looking at the most appropriate market structures and the required mechanisms to ensure that any rollout of smart meters is efficient and cost effective. Industry and the Government are in agreement that decisions on the most appropriate way forward in terms of market structure should not be taken until our analysis of all the issues related to a smart-meter rollout is complete.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000139"></a>It is for this reason that the smart metering clauses we have introduced enable us to pursue a range of possible market models. I draw the attention of the Committee to Clause 81(3)(k), which can be described as the modifications subsection. Under that provision, the Secretary of State can make licence modifications to suppliers&#146; licences requiring them to enter into agreements with meter companies and thereby, we argue, enabling certain kinds of centralised provision of smart meters and related services. Controls would be exerted over the meter companies via these modifications to suppliers&#146; licences.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000140"></a>The purpose behind the wording of the second part of this amendment is broadly similar to that already set out under paragraph (k). This amendment would enable suppliers to work together to purchase meter assets and services from a single source within a specified region. It is not immediately clear therefore that the amendment adds to the existing wording of Clause 81(3)(k).</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000141"></a>Given the scale and complexity of such a rollout, we are considering and evaluating market options, ranging from competitive delivery by meter operators to options for a more centralised rollout, where the industry might jointly contract for certain services. While we are grateful to the noble Lord for raising what are two undoubtedly important issues, we must resist the amendment, but I assure noble Lords that work on both market model and stranding is central to our ongoing analysis and will play an important role in forming our future decisions on smart metering.</p>

Northern Ireland has been mentioned, but I am not necessarily saying that that is the best area to choose, because it has historically had high domestic energy prices. My understanding is that the Italian electricity system has gone through this process comparatively recently. There seems to be a sense being conveyed that the UK is trying to start from first principles and go through this in a painfully slow fashion, whereas we may be able to stand on the shoulders of others, see what they have done and

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701103000198"></a>&#147;( ) Where the Secretary of State makes modifications under this section, such modifications must require that such meters have the facility to provide data on gas or electricity consumption in such form that it may be used for the purpose of assisting the householder to select the gas or electricity tariff which is most to the householder&#146;s advantage.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000150"></a>The noble Lord said: This area has already been touched on in the rather full debate that we had on the first amendment on smart meters. The amendment is to facilitate information on gas or electricity consumption that would help householders. One of the problems that has been highlighted is that there has been a difference of opinion between those promoting smart  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meters for the benefits that will accrue to those supplying gas and electricity, and those doing so for the benefits that will be supplied to the householder.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000151"></a>The amendment deals with one of the central problems with smart meters, which is also one of the central benefits to the consumer: that is, that you could use the information to switch quickly between suppliers to make the best use of better tariffs. If it is being done on the internet, you could do it on a daily basis or on a much more frequent basis. Depending on the model that is to be rolled out, that will leave the supplier of the gas meter with a problem. If the supplier is paying for the meter and, as soon as the meter is installed, the customer switches to another supplier, that might incur some difficulties with the business model.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000152"></a>However, we should not underestimate the value to the customer in financial terms of the ability to manage the smart meter. That is not an issue that should be taken lightly. Fuel poverty has been mentioned and there is greater mobility within the market for people to switch between different tariffs. One of the major benefits to the customer of using a smart meter is that the customer could use automatic systems to wash their clothes in the middle of the night or do anything that uses vast amounts of electricity on a much cheaper tariff. That could be done easily and cheaply by many householders, and it would have an interesting effect on levelling the grid if a greater proportion of those power-hungry activities, such as washing, were done at a time when more electricity is on the grid than is being used. It would have value in carbon-saving terms. The purpose of the amendment is to find out where the Government see the ultimate benefits of smart metering accruing. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps I can compare it with what happens now. I get electricity bills which cover a period in which there has been a change in the price of the electricity and I have yet to discover how on earth the company apportions my supply which covers a three-month period when there is a change of price half way. I have tried sitting down with a towel round my head to work it out. Not being a mathematician, I gave up. My wife positively refused to allow me to take it up with the company. I believe a smart meter would be able to answer that sort of thing at once. You would see exactly when the rate changed and what your reading was at that time.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000154"></a>I quiver at &#147;must&#148;. I find that slightly difficult. As the Minister said, there is still a great deal of work to be done to be able to have an effective rollout of smart meters. Although I understand the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, &#147;must&#148; brings a slight doubt into my mind.</p>

We have to guard against overselling smart meters, particularly in relation to fuel poverty. Many people who find it hard to pay their bills find it hard to do many things, and putting them in charge of a mini-power station in their house might be a little more than some of them are capable of. The majority of people in fuel poverty are there

When we start to be too specific and use &#147;must&#148;, we are getting into dangerous waters. We need to be able to help people who have difficulty. It is like us trying to work things like video recorders without children or grandchildren about&#151;I hasten to add that I do not have any grandchildren. Such things can be rather difficult. I can imagine the smart meter in the kitchen cupboard assuming the proportions of the remote control of the video recorder, or whatever. We have to be a wee bit careful about imposing too many &#147;musts&#148;. There has to be a bit of conditionality in this. That is not to say that we should not move quickly or that we should not make this as comprehensive as possible, but we have to take account of the difficulties that some of our fellow citizens might incur.</p>

The supply company now has the responsibility to look after this problem. One of their main concerns&#151;and this is something that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has drawn attention to on a number of occasions&#151;is with identifying those in difficulty. I do not think that there is significant intent that the fuel-poverty family themselves have to do anything.</p>

I usually express gratitude at this point for the contribution of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, who is often extremely helpful. Let me just say that I was rather shocked by his suggestion that we would need our grandchildren to show us how to use our video recorders. I find that quite challenging; I am still teaching my grandchildren how to do it, so there is a reverse of that situation. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated, calculating the bills is a different matter altogether. We should address ourselves to that point. There is no question of the consumer&#146;s rights being fulfilled if they cannot follow the position of caveat emptor because what is in front of them is incomprehensible.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000159"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for eschewing the opportunity to discuss the wider issues of smart meterage again. I shall therefore concentrate on his amendment. Of course, we are in favour of supporting consumers to use the energy market to their advantage and switch to the best energy tariffs but, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, that requires that they can identify those opportunities without excessive amounts of hard calculation. Of course, as we know, many consumers are already doing this; you have only to switch between energy companies at present to see that that occurs. There is no doubt that a smart meter can play a role in adding to the information and the readiness of the information for the consumer, which is a good thing.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000160"></a>I am in favour of the principle, but I am against the technical function of the meter itself being placed in primary legislation. That seems a circumscription too far. As I indicated earlier, I seek to preserve some flexibility with regard to that, which is why I shall ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. However, I reassure the Committee that in the event of a rollout of smart meters to domestic customers the intention would certainly be for each household to receive a visual display device. The display will provide the customer with the information about their energy use, enabling them to manage their energy consumption better. Customers will be able to use the information on the display to help to identify the appropriate tariff; it will indicate, too, what the noble Lord often emphasises&#151;the amount of energy consumption.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000161"></a>We are committed to the principle. What I am really not prepared to accept is this degree of technical detail in the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that response.</p>

That would completely negate any value that could accrue to people who wanted to use smart meters. I hope that in the consultation the cost-benefit analysis will take on board as a priority the positive benefits to the consumer as opposed to cost considerations about the unit, because without the information being available the meters lose many of their advantages.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080701103000163"></a>I love the asides in debates in this place. The Minister said that he is quite adept at using the video recorder. Perhaps I should mention that I recently gave a children&#146;s party. We have a video recorder, but one of the young children had no idea what it was because the technology has moved on and it is not possible to buy them. We are dealing with the antiquated, which reminds me of the joke about the gramophone. I raised that because I thought it might strike people further down the line as quite amusing. The Minister made a serious point about the benefits of VDU displays being available and showing information so that people can switch between suppliers. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000002"></a>The noble Lord said: We have discussed many aspects of smart metering and I think that this is a rather clever way of trying to make sure that all smart metering is done in one way. I know that the Government will not accept this amendment, but it is just a quick attempt to say what a benefit it would be if we did not just look at the class of customer but brought all customers together. There is a serious point to this.  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Government have talked about large, medium and small-sized customers, but does the size of the customer matter when you are talking about these types of meters? The meters could deal with metering for different types of customer. A large customer will not have just one access point into its premises.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000003"></a>I am particularly interested in this because of an issue that was brought to my attention about smart meters. I have spoken to a large supermarket, which brought in smart meters as an environmental benefit, about how it could manage its electricity supply. Using the better meters meant that it could contest the electricity charges because the old meters were not as accurate and there was a considerable differential. I was disappointed because this was seen as very valuable and it meant that those dealing with the metering issue immediately tried to save the supermarket as much money as possible and the environmental benefits were not looked at. The concept is that it is valuable for very large customers. I can see why the Government are splitting the customer base into different groups. They could introduce the meters to one group and then move down the line. There is, I would say, a disproportionately high benefit to the much smaller customers, especially the SMEs, but there will be no real difference to domestic properties. It is a real issue for those companies. There can be a major variation in the billing technique on the meters currently being moved. If a meter reading is not taken over a period of time, a large bill will suddenly turn up and can cause a major cash-flow problem. That has happened to a number of companies and individuals I have talked to.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000004"></a>That is the basis of the amendment. I know that that Minister will say that the Government will not take this route. However, if this massive investment takes place for domestic customers, I ask the Government to consider why all customers should not be dealt with in the same way. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080701108000012"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a transparency amendment, providing the citizen with the necessary information to enable them make more informed choices and decisions. I have read the Committee and Report stages on these matters in the Commons in their entirety. I am conscious of the detail and compromise introduced by the Minister, Mr Malcolm Wicks, set out in the House of Commons <I>Hansard</I> for 30 April, starting at col. 333. I mention that because it is important that people who study this debate read that speech and the debate that followed it on Report in the Commons, so that they understand fully what undertakings the Government have given, and what they have not.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000013"></a>The Government set out the benefits as they saw them, as alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. I accept the divisions that they have drawn between medium-sized and small-sized businesses and domestic, but will quote the Energy Minister and take the debate on a little further:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701108000047"></a>&#147;A roll-out of smart meters to the domestic sector is, of course, a far larger and much more complex project&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701108000035"></a>as my noble friend alluded to today.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701108000048"></a>&#147;It would involve replacing some 47 million electricity and gas meters&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701108000036"></a>that could now be as few as 23.5 million if meters measuring both electricity and gas are deployed&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080701108000051"></a>&#147;in every home in Great Britain. Current estimated costs to the economy are potentially between &#163;8 billion and &#163;14 billion over 20 years&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 30/4/08; col. 334.]</ul>
<p><a name="080701108000037"></a>I emphasise the point, which I think was made by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, about the need for us to graft the policy of introducing the meters on the back of the replacement programme, which is an eminently sensible way to proceed.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000014"></a>However, Ministers have stated that their intention is to report on the potential for domestic rollout by the end of the year and my noble friend has said that it might be a little later than that. The question then is, &#147;What happens then?&#148;. My amendment is a very mild shift in the Government&#146;s position, reflecting the views of the Members of the Committee in the House of Commons and expressed both in Committee and on Report. They were concerned at that time about the absence of a timetable.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000015"></a>My noble friend set out in great detail why he believes that a timetable should not be introduced, but my amendment is quite mild, in the sense that it asks the Government to introduce,</p>
<ul><a name="080701108000052"></a>&#147;within 12 months of the coming into force of this Act ... a timetable for the introduction of smart meters&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="080701108000038"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="080701108000053"></a>&#147;within 12 months of coming into force of this Act, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament, a draft of the proposal for regulations for the introduction of smart meters&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080701108000039"></a>It is only a slight shift in the position taken by the Minister in Committee. In so far as I would hope to be able to table a very similar amendment on Report, it might be that we can negotiate on the question of the number of months.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000016"></a>When I talked to Members of the Committee in the other place about what they thought, a view was expressed to me that it should be 18 months. The 12 months is just a try-on. There was a general view among Members of the Committee that some attempt should be made to set a timetable. This is not a hugely significant amendment, but it tries to take the debate forward by laying down some framework which, in my view, would be very helpful to those outside who are looking to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000017"></a>The debate has moved on since the debate in Committee. First, we have had a huge increase in energy prices, which must influence the judgment of the Government. Secondly, we have had developments in the climate change debate, which is now on the tongue of almost every politician worldwide. There have been major developments in the past three months in the climate change debate. We have had the Prime Minister&#146;s statement last week on renewables, which indicates the personal priority that he gives to this matter.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000018"></a>Thirdly, I understand that a statement was made by the Prime Minister in November 2007. I do not know the source, and it might well be that someone can identify it. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701108000049"></a>&#147;For every household over the next decade there will be the offer of a smart meter that will allow two-way communication between the supplier and customer, giving more accurate bills of course and making it easier for people to generate their own energy through microgeneration and sell it on to the grid&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701108000040"></a>If that statement is well sourced, one would have thought that must now influence the Government&#146;s judgment when they are considering the whole question of a timetable.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000019"></a>The Energy Retail Association&#146;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701108000050"></a>&#147;If the ambition to have all homes in Britain fitted with smart meters is to be achieved, the process of planning needs to begin sooner rather than later. In order to achieve the Government&#146;s stated expectation that smart meters will be rolled out to every British home within 10 years, the industry needs a mandate. It must commit now to a clear timetable and ensure that a decision is made quickly to grant the mandate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080701108000041"></a>I listened very carefully to the comments of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, who seemed to be suggesting that there was some dispute or argument going on in the Energy Retail Association&#146;s advice. I presume that the association is represented here today. It would be very interesting to know what its advice is now. Has it amended that advice? Is what my noble friend said accurate? The association should communicate to us and let us know precisely where it stands on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="080701108000020"></a>My amendment is minor but it deals precisely with the concern being expressed by those Members of the Committee in the Commons across the political divide who, almost to a person, wanted some kind of timetable.

It does a minimal amount in assisting the process by giving a timetable which is entirely reasonable, I should have thought, and almost necessary in view of the discussion that we have had. It is also saying what the minimum capabilities are that smart meters should have. It is not saying all the things that they should do, but saying what people will really want from the meters. If they can get the daily usage of energy, the total cost in the billing period and the cost per unit, that will help them very much indeed. There will doubtless be leaflets accompanying the companies to help them, but anybody can use the meter that does that to tell them what they need to know clearly. I should have thought that even I could use such a meter, and I am not terribly bright with that kind of electronic device. I hope that the Government are interested in the amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, made a particularly good point. In this frightening period we are living in, energy prices are utterly out of control. Last night I looked it up and our own electricity charges went up from 5.9p per unit last September to very nearly 10p. That is a huge difference. I cannot help but think that these smart meters will benefit those particularly who are less well off than others, so I give the amendment my wholehearted support.</p>

I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that the Government are interested in the amendment. We take all amendments seriously. Certainly my noble friend, as he has said, does not think that he is stretching the envelope too far for Government and thinks that there may be a basis for compromise. There may be, but let me reiterate the fact that we are concerned about fixing the details in primary legislation now. We regard that as somewhat premature; in the final analysis, it might bind us in such a way as to have negative implications for the very objectives that we share.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000024"></a>We are looking at ways to get the rollout for domestic consumers. The Bill provides the necessary flexibility while also ensuring that Parliament scrutinises the licence conditions that are eventually established. I reassure my noble friend in that respect that there is full parliamentary scrutiny of what the Government will do in this area, and I assure him that we will of course set out a timetable. If we decide by the end of this year&#151;and that is the decision framework to which we are committing ourselves&#151;that we wish to proceed with the smart meter rollout to domestic consumers, we understand entirely that we will not be able to do that without a timetable. That is necessary for the wider public and for the industry, which has to gear itself up for the necessary structures and investment

I am giving him the commitment that that is our intention. He will recognise that his amendment falls into the same category. It is much closer to the Government&#146;s thinking than one or two earlier amendments which sought to put in the Bill, and therefore in primary legislation, a commitment on a matter on which the Government need to preserve some flexibility. We do not doubt that the benefits of smart metering are potentially significant.</p>

He used the words &#147;there may be room&#148; in reference to compromise&#151;I usually write down what Ministers say. Is there any possibility that we might be able to consider, let us say, 18 months or 21 months, and that that might be the nature of any compromise, or are we ruling that out right now?</p>

I was merely indicating that I understand that what he is driving at has a fair amount of parliamentary support behind it. We are aware that my noble friend has a reputation for some degree of persistence, so it is highly unlikely that even when I get him to withdraw his amendment today&#151;if I am successful in that limited objective&#151;I will have seen the end of the matter, even if there are not further discussions. I was merely indicating to him that I am open-minded about those further discussions. I am not prepared be to pinned down the details at the moment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000027"></a>Let me once again make the obvious point: noble Lords have articulated these issues well enough in the Committee and we, of course, see the potential benefits of smart meters for domestic households. How could one gainsay those benefits and a number of other significant benefits? The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, raised the issue first in terms of the battle against climate change and the impact on the carbon count. The benefits are readily identified, but the Committee has not been quite so assiduous&#151;and why should noble Lords concern themselves with such matters?&#151;about the potential costs. The Government have to look at costs because they are borne not by the Government but by the people whom the Government represent. He will recognise that we have to do this analysis thoroughly, otherwise we would not be serving the community that we seek to serve.</p>

I was interested to hear the Minister say that we have not analysed the costs, but I have been trying to work out the figures he gave me for smart meters, and I get the impression that he is talking about them costing about &#163;200 each, whereas we have always been given the impression that they would be between &#163;95 and &#163;140 each. That would make the figures he gave to the Committee somewhat on the high side.</p>

I congratulate him on his ready calculation, but it is not just the meter. I again say to my noble friend that we do not see that there is a gain from placing in legislation this degree of restriction, but I recognise that he has support for his position. We will be prepared to discuss this matter further, but I want him to withdraw his amendment today.</p>

Like Camembert cheese, ideas mature. We have the Summer Recess. Over that period no doubt departmental officials will be very busy developing ideas with a view to taking the whole project forward. With that in mind, I refer to the intervention of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill about doing this work during the summer months and the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000031"></a>When that work is done on what people do abroad, can we also have some idea on costs? What are the Italians actually paying for their meters? Where are the meters manufactured? We need information about not just what is available but what the costs are and where meters are manufactured. Is there the potential for manufacture within the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="80701-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080701108000032"></a>I spoke to a company this morning called bglobal, of Darwen in Lancashire, which provides meters. It tells me that its meters come from Singapore and are fitted in Australia. The Australians have a fairly major programme. When this research is done, following the amendment of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, we might well be able to collect a lot of data prior to the Report debate. I am sure that we would all find that very helpful. On the basis of the Minister&#146;s assurance that these things are being considered, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080701112000002"></a>The noble Lord said: Those who were in the Chamber on 22 January will recollect that, when the House was asked to pass an order entitled the Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) Order 2008&#151;the CERT order as it is usually called&#151;I moved a regret Motion. That followed a very unsatisfactory debate in Grand Committee when I complained that, while the order imposed strict duties on the suppliers to secure 40 per cent of their carbon emission reductions from the so-called &#147;priority group&#148; of customers, who broadly might be described as the fuel poor&#151;and these were duties subject to substantial penalties in case of failure to comply&#151;the department flatly refused to tell the companies which households fell into the priority group. So the companies were driven into, what I called on that occasion, a very costly &#147;hunt the thimble&#148;.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, the Defra Minister responsible for the order, had, I suspect, a somewhat uncomfortable time trying to defend the indefensible. Angrily, noble Lords may remember, he challenged me to divide the House against the order. I refused for two reasons. First, the order is aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the existing domestic sector. I regard that as a very important aim. Secondly, I said that I would return to the matter when we had the Energy Bill before us.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000004"></a>We all know that the gas and electricity industry does its best to help the Government to achieve their objectives in the field of energy policy, and particularly for the domestic customer. It does that in a number of ways. One is the excellent voluntary agreement which was recently negotiated to increase the industry&#146;s expenditure on fuel poverty mitigation measures to some &#163;150 million a year by the year 2010. Another is

But what these require is an effective means of targeting the help on those who most need it. I ask noble Lords to hang on to &#147;targeting&#148;.</p>
<h5><a name="080701112000034"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000005"></a>However, since January, there have been some significant developments. In April, Ofgem mounted a fuel poverty summit, an objective of which was to concentrate on targeting the fuel poor. By then&#151;whether as a result of the discomfiture in January of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, or not&#151;Ministers had decided that they had to do something about it. The outcome of the summit was therefore the so-called fuel poverty action programme, a copy of which was sent to me by the noble Lord, Lord Mogg, on 4 June. In his covering letter, the noble Lord set out the programme&#146;s main points. I quote the first two:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701112000032"></a>&#147;The Government has announced that it will seek to legislate to allow the Department for Work and Pensions and energy suppliers to share data so that help can be targeted at vulnerable customers ... Energy suppliers have committed to improving the targeting of their social measures for fuel-poor customers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701112000021"></a>There were a number of other points, but they are not relevant to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000006"></a>The amendment is intended to provide an appropriate statutory backing for an information disclosure scheme that would enable the Government and the industry to achieve these objectives. It is drafted in a way that I would have tried to avoid if I had had any choice. It begins, for example, with the grant of a power to the Minister to modify the conditions of the industry&#146;s operating licences. It is clear to me and some others that that would not be the ideal way of dealing with it, but I had to do something like that to bring the clause within the Long Title; I express my gratitude to the Public Bill Office for its help in this regard.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000007"></a>The key provision of the new clause is quite clear. It would require Ministers, within six months of the Bill receiving Royal Assent, to bring forward regulations to establish a scheme for the disclosure to gas and electricity suppliers of information that would enable them to identify those of their domestic customers who are in receipt of the benefits, credits or allowances listed in Schedule 2 to the CERT order; I declare an interest as, being over 70, I am included in that schedule&#151;no doubt with a number of other noble Lords. Disclosure of that information would enable the suppliers to target&#151;I latch on to that word again&#151;not only the priority treatment groups under the CERT order, but also those most likely to be able to benefit under the suppliers of a voluntary fuel poverty mitigation programme. As noble Lords will realise, there is a high degree of overlap between those customer groups.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000008"></a>Of course, there must be safeguards over the use, sharing and protection of information disclosed under the scheme. Part of my amendment is directed to that. The tight timeframe of six months for preparing and laying the regulations demonstrates an intention underlying the urgency of dealing with this. If any of these policies are to take effect, it must be done quickly.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000009"></a>The regulations will need to be fairly far-reaching. They include at least four government departments: the Minister&#146;s own department, BERR; Defra; the  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Department for Work and Pensions; and Revenue and Customs, if one is talking about tax credits&#151;as we know from another incident, it ought to hold all the details. The regulations may have to modify some elements of current data protection legislation, or of carving out certain exemptions from such legislation. Therefore, because it is important, the clause provides for the regulations to be subject to an affirmative resolution procedure. Of course, that would provide for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000010"></a>A moment ago, I mentioned the Department for Work and Pensions, and I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, who gave me advance notice of the amendment that he tabled at the end of last week, which would provide for relevant information disclosures to gas and electricity suppliers in relation to customers who are in receipt of state pension credit. My immediate reaction was to say that, welcome though that might be, it affects only the smallest group of all those who are intended to qualify as members of the priority group under the CERT order and hence, by extension, only to a very small group of those who are vulnerable to fuel poverty. However, the new clause in the Pensions Bill, of which for better information I have acquired a copy, states very clearly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080701112000033"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision authorising the Secretary of State, or a person providing services to the Secretary of State, to supply relevant persons with social security information about persons in receipt of state pension credit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080701112000022"></a>&#147;Relevant persons&#148; are described later in the clause, but that broadly means the electricity and gas industries.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000011"></a>There you have a very clear precedent of what can be done for that group. I want to see it being done for the whole priority group. Otherwise, what is the purpose of listing them all in the CERT order and then not telling the industries who they are? That is the purpose of my amendment. Something along the lines of the Pensions Bill amendment would provide for the effective targeting&#151;I come back to that word&#151;that was required under the action programme following the fuel poverty summit. It seems to me to be absolutely in line with what the Government want to do and as subscribers to the action programme with what they have said they will do. I hope that Ministers may be able to smile on this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, on the Pensions Bill currently making its way through your Lordships&#146; House, the Government have tabled an amendment to allow the information of those on state pension credits to be used to better target fuel poverty. As he said, the amendment would extend the access to the information of other groups. While the Government&#146;s track record on data protection is not enviable, this might be a necessary way of tackling fuel poverty. Businesses are currently spending enormous amounts of money trying to find out who they are supposed to be helping, and it will be very interesting to hear from the Minister

Clearly, the area that we are all concerned about is information security. There are issues where, rightly, people do not want too many others to know which benefits they get and which category they are in; we all entirely understand that. I would particularly like to understand, in terms of the Pensions Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned, what the Government see as the safeguards to the data. In what way are the Government moving forward on data issues in that area? Those have to be robust. As fuel poverty is more and more an issue and a challenge to more people, we need to ensure that the agencies and companies concerned are able to maximise and roll out the programmes that are more desperately needed now than has been the case for some time.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned targeting. He emphasised the fact that this is covered by several different government departments, which is often the same with alternative energy, in which I have also been involved.

<p><a name="080701112000015"></a>There is a great complication as regards subsection (4) in this amendment. I feel incredibly strongly about the geographic difference. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, will realise that I have a meeting with him after Questions on Tuesday to discuss this very issue. It is absolute madness that, for example, someone on fuel poverty payments who lives on the south coast of England receives the same amount as someone living on the north coast of Scotland. Last weekend at home in the Scottish Borders, it was 52 degrees and we very nearly lit a fire. It was not that temperature on the south coast of England. We should seriously consider that there should be some geographic difference. This will not be the last that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, will hear from me on this subject. I look forward to talking to him. However, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I reiterate that it is an absolute scandal for anyone to suffer fuel poverty today. It is interesting that a former Conservative Minister responsible for energy has to bring forward this amendment rather than the Government.</p>

However, before we debate this issue, I have to point out that in 1996 there were 6.5 million households in fuel poverty and there are now 2.5 million. Of course, that is 2.5 million too many, but the fact that we have reduced the number should be put on the record and taken into account, although we all know that in the past year the number has increased. That is why I slightly resent&#151;but no more than that&#151;the

I think our record on this is pretty good&#151;not perfect, but pretty good.</p>

<p><a name="080701112000017"></a><a name="80701-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080701112000040"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> I did not mean to be offensive in the slightest. Because of the horrible escalation of fuel prices, the figures which the Minister has just quoted will not be correct by the end of this current financial year. In the <I>Times</I> last week, it was estimated that 6.5 million people will be in fuel poverty by the end of next year. The noble Lord said that 2.4 million people is indeed too many, but that is almost a trebling of the actual number. It is very worrying. I apologise most sincerely if he thought I was being offensive. I did not mean to be offensive in the slightest.</p>

<p><a name="080701112000018"></a><a name="80701-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="080701112000041"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The noble Lord was not being offensive. I have never known him to be offensive and I am sure he never would be. I just slightly resented the comment. That was all. I make it clear that it is a real problem and an existing problem. It was a problem when the last Government were in power and it is a problem for us now. It is important to say that the figures, which I thought were agreed, are as I have stated them.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000019"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, because it is an achievement to have got this amendment on to the Marshalled List at all. No doubt, it is absolutely rightly on the Marshalled List and it gives us a chance to discuss what is clearly a very important subject, which becomes more important for exactly the reason mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer&#151;that this is a time of rising prices and global financial uncertainty. The impact of those factors on the most vulnerable in society is clear.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080701112000020"></a>This is an interesting amendment. I think the second part, rather than the first, concerns the noble Lord, but I shall deal with both parts. The amendment appears to seek to add an additional consumer protection element to the Secretary of State&#146;s existing powers to impose carbon reduction obligations on energy suppliers. It also provides for a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling the provision of information to help suppliers identify particular consumers. It is that last point about which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is most concerned.</p>
<h5><a name="080701116000020"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000001"></a>The Committee will be aware that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to impose carbon emissions reduction obligations on suppliers is the power which underpins the delivery of the carbon emissions reduction target, CERT, which is bolder and wider than its predecessor, the energy efficiency commitment. Starting this year, the CERT scheme effectively doubles the carbon reduction objectives we are imposing on suppliers and we believe will significantly increase the number of customers benefiting from the scheme. As has been said, the scheme already contains an obligation to achieve 40 per cent of its target carbon savings from defined groups of vulnerable consumers, who are very much the groups identified in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. When combined with Warm Front funding the CERT scheme will result in spending on energy efficiency and other measures  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in low income, elderly and disabled households of around &#163;2.3 billion in the period 2008-11. By anyone&#146;s standards, that is a large sum. I was grateful for what the noble Lord said and for his support for the voluntary agreement.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000002"></a>The first part of the amendment seeks to add further to the Secretary of State&#146;s powers in relation to carbon reduction obligations. It would enable him to amend licences in order to require licensees to take further steps to protect consumers. It is not immediately clear from the amendment text what form these consumer protections may take. What is clear is that this power is intended to be used in relation to orders made under Part 1 of the Gas Act or Part 2 of the Electricity Act, which impose carbon reduction obligations on energy suppliers. This suggests that any consumer protection measures would therefore also need to be related to carbon reduction, so this could involve activities such as improving the insulation in a consumer&#146;s home.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000003"></a>As I have said already, under the CERT scheme the Government already have powers to ensure that a large percentage of the carbon reduction activities within that scheme are targeted at vulnerable groups of consumers. We would argue that the first part of the amendment is not strictly necessary, as we do not believe that it would add to existing requirements for suppliers to target carbon reduction measures at a priority group of vulnerable consumers. Finally, on the first amendment, in addition, this kind of power may well also cut across existing voluntary action by suppliers outside of their CERT obligations.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000004"></a>The second part of the amendment relates to the sharing of information&#151;the targeting that the noble Lord insists on&#151;to assist suppliers in identifying the particular customers specified. This is obviously an issue of particular and lasting interest to the noble Lord&#151;I pay credit to him for his role in this&#151;particularly in relation to the targeting and delivery of the CERT scheme.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000005"></a>Ensuring consumers receive the support to which they are entitled is, of course, an ambition which the Government fully share. Which person of good will could not share that desire? Members of the Committee will be aware, because, not least, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, told them, that improving the identification and targeting of measures aimed at vulnerable consumers was one of the main themes of the Ofgem fuel poverty summit in April. The attendance at that summit of several government Ministers, representatives from the European Commission and the major energy suppliers, plus a wide range of groups from the voluntary sector, is an illustration of just how seriously this issue is being taken.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000006"></a>However, the very fact that this issue required such a high-level discussion by that group also illustrates that while intuitively sharing data to identify the vulnerable feels right, obvious and straightforward, when it comes to finding practical ways to deliver this, things immediately become a good deal more complex. Identifying and reaching vulnerable consumers requires information on the individual circumstances of each customer. This can often involve understanding the state of their housing, their income levels, the benefits they receive and the fuel prices they are paying, and some of those are dynamic factors that change frequently.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000007"></a>No single organisation holds that breadth of information on an individual consumer. That is why finding an effective method of identifying significant numbers of vulnerable consumers requires a joined-up approach within and across government departments, suppliers and other agencies involved. That work is well under way, but it involves complex legal and human rights issues that need to be worked through&#151;to use the noble Lord&#146;s own expression, there have to be safeguards. These are legitimate privacy and data protection concerns. Any action to share data held by government departments or suppliers must be justifiable in terms of the Data Protection Act&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to that Act&#151;and the European Convention on Human Rights. Any large-scale action to identify vulnerable groups would potentially involve sharing the personal details of hundreds of thousands of individual consumers.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000008"></a>Data sharing on that scale must be justifiable and proportionate. That presents difficulties because, as noble Lords will be aware, in order to identify vulnerable consumers, we need to use proxies, such as being in receipt of certain benefits. However, these proxy tests are an imperfect means of targeting and, as a result, can capture a very wide group of consumers, many of whom may not be eligible for government or supplier support schemes. Therefore, in many cases, this level of data sharing would not be considered proportionate or justifiable, and we do not feel that it would be appropriate at this stage to take broad legislative powers in relation to data sharing before we have worked through some of these complex issues. We must be sure that any sensitive information being shared can deliver the outcomes that we are looking for, is appropriately protected because the safeguards are in place and can be delivered in a way that is consistent with data protection and human rights legislation. The DWP, BERR and Defra are committed to exploring how data held by DWP may best be used to ensure that appropriate help is targeted on vulnerable groups. We will continue to keep the case for large-scale legislative data-sharing provision under close consideration.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000009"></a>However, there are a number of other legislative and non-legislative actions, some of which have been referred to in the debate, which we are already taking forward in the short term to try to improve the identification and targeting of vulnerable consumers. I believe that is a demonstration of our good faith and of the Government&#146;s commitment to this important issue of effective targeting.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000010"></a>The amendment to the Pensions Bill has been referred to. It is currently being considered in this House and provides a power to enable data sharing between the Government and energy suppliers regarding elderly consumers. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked about that. That amendment will allow that department to share data with energy companies to allow them better to target the range of help available, including access to social assistance programmes for pensioners most likely to be fuel poor. However, I have to tell the noble Lord that the precise details of the future arrangements are still being considered and discussed

It will be important to ensure that there is a beneficial outcome for the great majority of customers whose data are shared and that, as far as possible, it is awarded automatically.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000013"></a>The Pensions Bill amendment is an important step forward on data sharing. Moreover, because of the more limited focus of this amendment on a particular group of vulnerable consumers, some of the issues of proportionality and data protection I have just outlined can be better managed.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000014"></a>Briefly, on non-legislative steps, all eligible households that come forward to the Warm Front scheme&#151;which, as the Committee will know, offers grants to help pay for heating and insulation improvements in the home&#151;are now also offered further assistance to ensure that they are aware of all the benefits to which they are entitled. Last year, Warm Front performed approximately 50,000 benefit-entitlement checks, which helped locate additional benefits for over 18,000 people with an average value of over &#163;28 per week, or &#163;1,500 per year. Working with the energy suppliers, the departments referred to have already undertaken two small winter mail-outs based on DWP data, which the noble Lord referred to. In the past two winters 350,000 customers on pension credit have been sent information to tell them about the Warm Front initiatives, the CERT measures and to offer advice on reducing their energy bills.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000015"></a>Following the fuel poverty summit, suppliers have committed themselves to improving the transparency of the support that they can offer vulnerable customers. This includes ensuring that websites to help you switch energy supplier, agencies such as Citizens Advice and consumers have clear, accessible, information on what support is available. Suppliers will also be reviewing the effectiveness of the Home Heat Helpline, which is run by the Energy Retail Association, to ensure that it functions effectively as a central point of contact for help and advice on paying fuel bills.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000016"></a>I end my list of examples with experience from regional programmes, such as the Warm Zones scheme, which has shown that an area-based approach can be one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways of identifying and helping the fuel poor. As part of the drive to better target the most vulnerable consumers, local and central government and suppliers will work together to build on this approach and explore if an area-by-area approach could have benefits for the delivery of other programmes such as CERT.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080701116000017"></a>I hope that we have understood the question of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, correctly. Analysis indicates that suppliers would need to target around 2.4 million households to meet their CERT obligations. Ofgem will report a little later in the year on how many have received assistance so far.</p>

<p><a name="080701116000018"></a>I hope that I have provided some reassurance to the noble Lord; I am sure that I have not told him anything that he does not already know better than me. However, we recognise that this is a major issue, and I emphasise the wide range of work that is under way. We will review progress from the Ofgem summit in autumn 2008. The amendment to the Pensions Bill is an important start, and we will learn lessons from it to help inform further work on other legislative data-sharing options. I assure the noble Lord that we will keep the case for further legislation under review in the context of our ongoing commitment, shared by everyone in the Committee, to address fuel poverty. At this stage, it is not a simple matter of adding further legislation. However, I again thank the noble Lord for introducing the topic to the Committee this afternoon.</p>

Secondly, in the light of the position that the Minister outlined to the Committee this afternoon, I recognise that there has been a sea-change in the Government&#146;s position since as recently as last January, and I welcome that. I claim no credit for having stimulated it, although the noble Lord was kind enough to indicate that perhaps I might have helped. The important thing is that there now seems to be a way forward by building on what has been put forward for the Pensions Bill and the other non-legislative methods.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000003"></a>The noble Lord suggested that there needs to be a lot of information about the people who might be targeted. For the purposes of the CERT order, no information is required. The categories in the schedule are absolutely clear: those in receipt of certain benefits, certain tax credits, certain pensioners and so on. There is no question of having to see what their energy consumption is, what kind of house they are living in or anything like that. That may be necessary for the purposes of social tariffs for the electricity companies, but for the moment I have been concentrating on the CERT order. I hope that that will not be lost sight of by adding the additional difficulties if one is going to try to target the fuel poor as a whole.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000004"></a>The noble Lord gave me rather more comfort than perhaps I had been expecting in the wake of last January&#146;s debate. For that I am very grateful. We want to study very carefully what he has said. I will consider whether it is necessary to return to this matter on Report.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000005"></a>I understand if one is dealing with the Data Protection Act and human rights the smaller the group one is identifying, the easier it is to justify under that legislation; the larger the group, the more difficult it is. There must be some way of approaching this. I have no doubt that the Government have this very much under consideration. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for what he said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0807021000009"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope to move this amendment more briefly than the last one as I am conscious that we are nearing the end of our deliberations and that we want to reach the end of the list before we have to adjourn.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000010"></a>The amendment is about a possible link between electric and magnetic fields, EMF, and extremely low frequency electricity current, ELF, and the incidence of childhood leukaemia for children either in utero or born and living within 200 metres of a high-voltage transmission line. This issue is clearly important. It has been the subject of several reports and of a recent debate in Grand Committee on the Housing and Regeneration Bill on 10 June, when the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Best, tabled an amendment in pretty well the same terms as the one I am speaking to this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000011"></a>The issue is whether it is desirable, necessary or proportionate to take steps to reduce the risk. It is interesting to learn that the evidence of the link is based almost wholly on epidemiological studies. There is very little, if anything, to establish causation. That makes it extremely difficult for those responsible for policy to decide action because one is inevitably thrown back on the precautionary principle. I have discussed this issue with the charity Children with Leukaemia and, more recently, with a scientist from the National Grid, Dr John Swanson. I am extremely grateful to both for the information and guidance they have given.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000012"></a>I mentioned the reports a moment ago. The most significant report is the so-called SAGE report&#151;an acronym for the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs. It is an admirable initiative, trying to break away from the confrontational approach and to establish a collaborative effort to reach some consensus about what advice to give to the authorities. The stage that we have now reached is that the Health Protection Agency has commented on the SAGE report and  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issued its own advice. We now await the Government&#146;s response to that report. We are promised that &#147;later this year&#148;&#151; I take that from the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, in Grand Committee on the Bill that I have just mentioned, on 10 June reported in col. 179. Can Ministers perhaps be a little more specific about that, since &#147;later this year&#148; still leaves us with six months? Could we have slightly more detail?</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000013"></a>The noble Baroness referred to &#147;precautionary measures&#148;. Could we have some indication of what those might be? One suggestion widely canvassed was that authorities should insist on a very wide corridor, of perhaps 400 metres, within which housing and schools would be planned. What has been made clear in the grid is that that would entail a huge cost and an enormous sterilisation of land. The HPA&#146;s estimate of what we are dealing with here is that out of 450 cases of childhood leukaemia per annum perhaps two might be attributable to ELF/EMF from transmission lines. I find it very difficult to believe that a corridor could conceivably be regarded as a proportionate response to that. At the other end, there is apparently some evidence that EMF fields emanating from poor house wiring might be contributing to the problem and that the cost might be as little as &#163;20 a house to put that right. I have no means of knowing whether that is right, but that is the figure that I was given.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000014"></a>There is a third matter which perhaps ought to be left to the Planning Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, said,</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000130"></a>&#147;the HPA recommends that, within the existing government planning framework, the attention of local authority planning departments and electricity companies be drawn to the evidence for a possible small increase in childhood leukaemia&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/08; col. GC 179.]</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000092"></a>The HPA itself has also said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0807021000111"></a>&#147;Raising awareness of a hazard without giving advice on how to reduce exposure could cause anxiety and attendant health detriment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000093"></a>Just issuing information to planning authorities without some accompanying guidance would seem to me to fall into the HPA&#146;s trap. I was quoting from paragraph 6 of its report.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000015"></a>The industry takes a very positive approach to this issue. There is no suggestion of trying to sweep it under the carpet. The concerned NGOs remain very anxious to continue the collaborative approach inherent in the SAGE process. My proposed new clause, which was suggested by Children with Leukaemia, makes certain more specific suggestions about distance from developments or a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure no risk. I am prepared to agree that there can never be no risk when talking about developments of this kind. The involvement of the HPA has also been referred to.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000016"></a>For these reasons, it would be wrong to press this in advance of the Government&#146;s promised response to SAGE, but the amendment does give Ministers an opportunity to add to what the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, said on 10 June. On that basis, I shall decide whether to return to this on Report. That will depend on when we can expect the Government&#146;s response. We will not reach that point until after the long Recess, so there is time for this to be considered. I

I beg to move.</p>

I must declare a direct interest. This year, my grandson suffered from leukaemia and to see an eight year-old go through the agonies of the necessary treatment fixes the issue very firmly indeed in one&#146;s mind. I was very grateful for the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, approached the whole issue and for how constructive he has been.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000018"></a>I regret that I do not have a great deal to add to his extremely comprehensive analysis because he was so fair in identifying the nature of the problem and in indicating the difficulties of the potential solutions. He is right about the fundamental position that we do not know enough about leukaemia to identify its causes and, as regards power lines, he also showed statistically how limited any effect is but, however small the number of cases, every child affected is a grievous concern to us all. As he said, we have to have proportionality in developing a strategy for the grid that relates to what still would be just a potential factor with regard to the illness and to children. That shows how problematic the whole issue is.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000019"></a>Certainly, the industry and the Government have taken the Draper report very seriously, as they have any issue of public health. What constructively can we do to advance understanding of the issue and what action needs to be taken? I was extremely grateful to the noble Lord for the way in which he spoke about the work of SAGE, the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs. It certainly brought everyone together on a remit to identify and explore the implications of the issues. It reported last year and made a number of recommendations in relation to power lines and property, and, as the noble Lord also added, to wiring in homes and electrical equipment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000020"></a>SAGE set out a range of precautionary options to reduce exposures significantly, involving the physical separation of buildings from power lines. It identified the best-available option for obtaining significant exposure reduction; namely, a combination of no new power lines and no new developments too close to residential developments and schools. It also undertook a cost-benefit analysis of this precautionary option and found that, because of the difficulty of cause and effect and the small numbers involved, it was difficult to reach a positive cost-benefit analysis on any action, which is what the noble Lord very fairly reflected in his speech.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000021"></a>We are currently considering the report very seriously. The noble Lord mentioned that my noble friend Lady Andrews has already commented on it. The work is ongoing and we are considering the Health Protection Agency&#146;s advice. It will also take into account the cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia and the advice of the World Health Organisation which was published last year.</p>

I somewhat doubt whether we will have the Government&#146;s response to the report before we have completed our deliberations on the Bill. We are committed to doing it this year, but there is a lot of work. I cannot give him the assurance that he sought that we would have it ready for Report in the autumn, as far as this measure is concerned.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000023"></a>The noble Lord will understand our reluctance to pre-empt by any amendment at this stage the consideration of the report. I am grateful to him for having raised an issue of the greatest concern to the industry and to the Government. There is not the slightest doubt of the obligation on the Government to examine the issue thoroughly, which they are doing, and to respond to the report, which raises very profound and difficult issues. I hope that I have at least conveyed that seriousness on the part of the Government, if I cannot help the noble Lord regarding the timetable.</p>

I think particularly of Scotland, where there are a great many planning inquiries going on in a number of directions. Is that a consideration?</p>

That has all got to be taken into account. Obviously, we are expecting, and are due to have, a substantial extension of power generation to the grid from such a large number of sources, and the noble Baroness is right to say that we need to take into account how and where those lines are constructed. That is all part of the work that is being done, and I give her that assurance at least.</p>

Clearly, the Government are seized of the problem. Whether we can get their response to the report in time for the last days of Report stage of the Bill, we shall have to wait and see. It would be very helpful if they could manage to achieve that.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000027"></a>I recognise that there is another important group of amendments to come, and the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has been waiting very patiently. I will just add one point. The first thing that I ever did for my constituents, very soon after I was elected, was to persuade the London Electricity Board to bury a distribution cable that was going straight through a housing estate in my constituency on pylons. I am told that that makes no difference to the ELF/EMF problem, unless you are a little bit away from it. One has lived with this problem, which was some 46 years ago. I&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0807021000034"></a>I have had the benefit of two very good and constructive discussions with the Bill team and, to an extent, they were quite reassuring. By the middle of  


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last week, I was very reassured, until I read a very good speech by the Prime Minister given last Thursday to the low carbon economy summit. Early on in the speech, which I shall pr&#233;cis, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000131"></a>&#147;let me set out for you our strategy to build Low Carbon Britain. Our first priority is to provide ... competitive markets and an entrepreneurial, pro-business culture. ... we will never put these at risk&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000094"></a>I would infinitely have preferred it had he made it clear that his first priority was security of supply and control over our energy destiny. It seems to me that our business credentials could well have been a perfectly adequate second priority. This lies at the heart of the matter.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000035"></a>I am sad to say that in the past 25 years&#151;not exclusively the fault of this Government&#151;Britain has drifted more and more towards being an entrepot nation, particularly London. I am a film producer, so I think I am allowed to conjure up romantic visions of old black and white films, such as &#147;Macao&#148; and the Zanzibar films, where dodgy people were able to do dodgy deals in a dodgy environment and where the wink and the nod increasingly became the culture of the hour. That troubles me. We are moving towards an assumption that if it is a good deal, if it is good business and if you do not look too carefully at who is doing that business, it is okay. I submit, in the case of energy security, that it is anything but okay&#151;hence my proposed amendment.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000036"></a>The amendment is reasonably complicated, but it does the job. The Bill team and I have discussed it and it is a competent amendment. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to proposed new Section 44B(2):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0807021000126"></a>&#147;OFGEM shall, within such period as the Secretary of State may require, give a report to the Secretary of State on the effect of the consideration or considerations concerned on the case&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000095"></a>The case would be the takeover, merger or acquisition of one of our significant energy interests. The amendment continues with the words &#147;The report shall contain&#148; and it talks about that. Proposed new Section 44B(4) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0807021000127"></a>&#147;OFGEM&#146;s advice shall cover the issues of&#151;</p>
</ul><ul><a name="0807021000132"></a>(a) financial liability&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000096"></a>which is the deal entered into, where the money comes from and on what terms;</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000133"></a>&#147;(b) transparency&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000097"></a>which is the governance of the acquiring corporation or company; and,</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000134"></a>&#147;(c) security of supply&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0807021000098"></a>I ask the Government to come up with reasons why one would not want that information. Why on earth would a significant transaction take place in the energy sector without that information being on the public record: the transparency of the organisation concerned; where the money comes from; what the terms are; and what security of supply we in the UK can expect as a result of that transaction?</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000037"></a>I want to add to my concerns. Much of the thrust of my argument was contained in my speech at Second Reading on 21 May at cols. 1948 to 1501. In it I quoted our current Prime Minister in 1989 and again in 1991 saying,</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000135"></a>&#147;there has been very little attempt to stand up for ordinary people against the vested interests of business and vast corporations&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0807021000099"></a>In a subsequent speech he said that the current Government,</p>
<ul><a name="0807021000136"></a>&#147;would appease the vested interests of their friends in the private sector before advancing the public interest which it is their duty to uphold&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/2/91; col. 754.]</ul>
<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000038"></a>All I am arguing here is that it is an absolute duty to uphold the public interest. The public interest will be best upheld by the incorporation of the type of amendment that I am suggesting here. I find it very difficult to take on board the argument that the situation is already well covered and that the nation is already absolutely secure when it is clear that all the countries with which we would normally associate ourselves&#151;the democratic nations of western Europe and, most particularly, the United States&#151;would not countenance the possibility of a portion of their energy supplies being owned and operated by companies with which they did not in any way, shape or form fully conform. That is particularly true of the United States, a nation that we continually seem to hold up as the apex of our economic ambitions. America would not dream of allowing a foreign company or corporation to own any of its energy supplies. We know that; the Americans make no bones about it. Why have we decided on a policy that is so entirely different? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0807021000039"></a><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0807021000150"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for tabling the amendment, to which I was pleased to be a signatory. The issues are simple. Our nation is international and operates effectively in a global economy. We are proud of that, and lead many parts of the world, including Europe, in that sense. However, that leadership and globalisation&#151;that openness&#151;requires certain standards for businesses and business ownership. They consist of the classic capital model of decisions being made on the commercial and financial basis of a return to shareholders, whoever they may be, and on a degree of transparency in the whole area of company and corporate reporting.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000040"></a>However, there are good reasons to look at that more closely in certain sectors. The defence sector is clearly one and so, increasingly, is the energy sector. Over the past few years, energy security has rightly become a more important and highly regarded area, which we understand better than ever before is important to our national security. I am the last person who would want a clause that could be used for a nationalist, protectionist reason; that is always an issue with this type of clause. It is a question of balance.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000041"></a>I will be particularly interested to hear the Government&#146;s response to the possibility of organisations taking over strategic sectors of our energy industry where there is a political rather than commercial objective. Where there is a politically driven agenda, or a sovereign wealth fund whose shareholding and strategic company aims have no transparency whatsoever, there must be a balance between energy security and the open market capitalism and globalisation that this country would generally be proud of. That balance is important in this area, and I welcome this amendment.</p>

There were rumours in the press that Gazprom was threatening to bid for Centrica, which includes British Gas, among other things. I am not sure that I got a clear enough answer, but I made it clear to the Government that that would be totally unacceptable. There could be no reciprocity or transparency of any kind; that must be firmly resisted.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000043"></a>That is quite different from the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Mischievously, I ask him what his view was when the Government chose to sell Westinghouse to the Japanese.</p>

Another point that underlines the importance of this amendment is that over recent years, instead of competition proliferating on the European stage, the number of large energy suppliers has shrunk as large corporations have merged for reasons of size or marketplace. Indeed, we are looking at a situation where very few players in the market are dealing with interests within countries. I recently had a meeting with most of the large energy suppliers on a carbon labelling scheme. It was amazing to have the five or six people in the room representing such a large tranche of the market. If some of the deals that have been speculated about go through, that number will shrink. It is therefore important that we look carefully at companies that will be moving into the field, especially with the gas pipelines and the situation about gas supply. As the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, pointed out, this amendment is at the tail end of the Bill, but I believe it is an issue that, as an amendment, is intrinsically important to the basis of the Bill, and I hope that the Minister comes forward with a positive response to the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0807021000046"></a>Everyone shares the noble Lord&#146;s desire to ensure that our regulatory framework has robust powers to address takeovers of UK energy assets where they may operate against the public interest and, in particular, to address any concerns arising from energy mergers. Maintaining the security of our energy supplies as we, as a country, make the difficult transition from being a net exporter of energy to being a net importer brings new and difficult challenges. As part of the Government&#146;s response to those challenges, much of the Bill, which we have now been debating for five days, is about ensuring that we have the right legislative environment to support the investment in the new kinds of infrastructure and technologies that we will need to cut carbon emissions and ensure security of supply.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000047"></a>Much of this will involve foreign direct investment. Maintaining the UK&#146;s long-standing policy&#151;a policy that we should defend&#151;of being open to inward

It is also agreed that we need certain standards in ownership takeovers, and I hope that my response may go some way to persuading the Committee that the right safeguards already exist within the Enterprise Act and within European law. Why we allow foreign companies to invest in our economy is sometimes asked. The answer is, in short, that we are open to foreign investment in our economy for the obvious benefits that it brings in capital and expertise. As long as there are appropriate protections, it is the Government&#146;s firm view that we should remain open to foreign investment and resist protectionism, which is a disease that many countries find themselves prey to, particularly when economic circumstances are difficult. We have resisted it over many decades, and we should continue to do so. It has always been in our interest as a country to be free-traders.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000048"></a>The aim of Amendment No. 76A is to insert into the Enterprise Act 2002 a new public interest consideration in relation to energy security. My noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 76B would see the plurality of persons controlling energy enterprises become specified grounds on which the Secretary of State may intervene in mergers.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000049"></a>We agree that we must ensure that the UK has robust powers to address takeovers in this sector. I assure the Committee that we do not believe that that is either necessary or appropriate. Two concerns are key to energy in this concept. One is ensuring a competitive market and choice for the consumer. The other is ensuring a secure and dependable energy supply. Under UK and European merger laws, independent competition authorities are responsible for ensuring the protection of competition, while our Enterprise Act also addresses wider issues of public interest.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000050"></a>Currently, through the powers in the Act, there are two specified public interest considerations. One is national security and the second is plurality in the media. The national security provision references the definition of public security in the European merger regulation. Recent case law of the European Court of Justice&#151;the ECJ&#151;confirms that the public security or public interest consideration includes energy security in cases where there is a genuine and serious threat to what is described as societal needs, such as energy supply.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000051"></a>Let me put it another way. It is fair to say&#151;I have to concede this&#151;that there are not a great many ECJ cases on the issue, but our view is that, having considered what case law there is, it is highly likely that energy security would be within the ambit of public security. In particular, that view is supported by paragraphs 43 and 46 in the Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium case regarding Distrigas. In that case, the Court indicated in paragraph 47 of its judgment that exemptions to general principles must be &#147;interpreted strictly&#148; and   


<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that &#147;public security&#148; could only be invoked if the threat was genuine and sufficiently serious, affecting a fundamental societal need.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000052"></a>In paragraph 48, the ECJ further indicated that the restriction must be the minimum necessary to meet that need. In the earlier case of Campus Oil, which is also relevant to the meaning of the expression &#147;public security&#148;, the European Court found in favour of the Irish Government. It was accepted that their concern about energy supplies could transcend matters of purely economic interest and intrude on the security of the nation. So we are of the view that recent case law confirms that the public security or public interest consideration includes energy security.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000053"></a>If that is right, it means that, should the acquisition of a UK energy company or assets raise a genuine and serious public interest concern about the lasting security of energy supply in the UK, the Secretary of State will be able to have those concerns examined by the OFT, and, if appropriate, the Competition Commission, and he can ultimately intervene in the merger if he considers it necessary.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000054"></a>I add one final but extremely important point. Since public security is a term which appears in the European merger regulation, which has been held by the ECJ to include the security of energy supply, we think it inappropriate for the UK to introduce its own national provision. To do so would cast doubt on the breadth of the term &#147;public security&#148; as it appears in the European merger regulation.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000055"></a>If I am asked, &#147;Why do you not want an energy security public interest consideration for the UK?&#148;, let me try to answer like this. First, seeking an energy security public interest consideration would indicate that we do not believe that it falls within the ambit of the existing national security consideration. That would have obvious implications for other sectors, such as telecommunications, which are not specified in the legislation, but which, like energy security,  we believe fall under the wider concept of national security.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000056"></a>Secondly, there is the open markets issue, which would indicate that we believe that it is legitimate for Governments to consider mergers in the energy sector differently from any other mergers. Thirdly, we could not rely on it to intervene in larger mergers that fell to the European Commission to review unless it&#151;the European Commission&#151;approved the new consideration, which is far from certain.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000057"></a>The second amendment relates to the need to ensure plurality of ownership of energy assets and companies. I again suggest that the existing provisions, which are designed to prevent excessive concentration of ownership, are sufficient. Where a merger raises concerns around the possibility of an insufficient number of enterprises operating in the market, such concerns would be addressed by the competition assessment of the merger. In relation to the energy sector, these provisions would prevent  any one company from dominating our energy  market and as a result creating risks of disruption  to supply.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>1 July 2008 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000058"></a>The arguments which were made to support a separate power for the Secretary of State to intervene in media mergers&#151;I pay great tribute to my noble friend for the part he played in that legislation&#151;on grounds of plurality cannot be transferred directly to this energy sector. Energy is different in this context. The key concern beyond the economic one of maintaining competition is ensuring security of supply. As distinct from the issue of media plurality before 2003 and the Enterprise Act, a serious threat to energy supply is covered by national security considerations as set out in that Act.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000059"></a>In considering the proposals, it may assist if I briefly outline how the present regulatory process works. Mergers in the UK and the EU are regulated by the relevant independent competition authorities, whether it is the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission in the case of a UK merger, or the European Commission in the case of a merger involving large enterprises. Mergers are considered by the competition authorities on the basis of their impact on competition in the relevant market, but, in addition, I emphasise that, on the announcement of a proposed merger or takeover, the Secretary of State has the power to issue an intervention notice for any such merger if he considers that it may raise particular non-competition-related concerns falling within the scope of a public interest consideration that has been specified in the Enterprise Act 2002. Following a Secretary of State&#146;s intervention on public interest grounds, the OFT is under an obligation to investigate and report on the issues that have been raised.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000060"></a>The details of this OFT report may also include representations from other organisations with an interest in the specific sector&#151;in this case, Ofgem. This provides these organisations with the opportunity to provide information and advice regarding the energy market. If on receipt of the OFT report and the other advice that the OFT has received, the Secretary of State decides to refer the merger to the Competition Commission, the commission has 24 weeks to make its recommendations to government on the relevant non-competition, public interest considerations. This would be in addition to any competition issues that it was already looking at. The Secretary of State must  then decide whether to make an adverse public  interest finding and, if so, whether to allow the merger to proceed, to impose conditions or to block it  altogether.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000061"></a>Even if the parallel competition investigation by the authorities does not find against the merger, the Secretary of State may none the less decide to act on public interest grounds. However, of course, any remedies imposed following such an intervention would have to be reasonable and proportionate. For example, depending on the case, this could include a requirement to hold an asset separately or to divest certain interests, such as an interconnector, a storage facility or generation capacity. A decision by the Secretary of State on whether to intervene in any merger would have to be considered on a case-by- case basis.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000062"></a>My noble friend asked at the start of his speech about Ofgem, in relation particularly to proposed new subsection (4) in Amendment No. 76A on Ofgem&#146;s advice. I am advised that financial liability, transparency and security of supply are considerations that Ofgem could under the present law look at in the scenario that I have just described.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000063"></a>I have gone on quite long enough; it is half-past seven. It is such an important issue that it has been worth trying to describe the Government&#146;s position on it. I hope that I have to some extent reassured the Committee that the existing national security public interest consideration provides adequate scope to take action as necessary to intervene on public interest grounds, and not just on competitive grounds, in mergers in the energy sector. The plurality of  energy ownership is not a distinct public interest consideration in its own right but is contained within the competition scrutiny that any merger must undergo and the energy security aspect of national security.</p>

<p><a name="0807021000064"></a><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0807021000154"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> I tried to follow that argument as carefully as I could. The noble Lord said that the Secretary of State could intervene on public interest grounds. Suppose that the two companies that decide to merge are, because of previous takeovers, abroad and are not in Europe, but are somewhere else. What can he intervene on? Can he prevent the merger just because they happen to have contracts in this country to supply energy? Or is he saying that they can be told that they cannot continue to supply energy, in which case what happens? Perhaps that is a stupid question, but it struck me that it might happen.</p>

<p><a name="0807021000065"></a><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80701-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0807021000155"></a>Lord Bach:</b> No question from the noble Baroness is stupid, and that one certainly is not. I will be very careful in the answer that I give. Because this is such a delicate and important point, I wonder whether instead of just telling the noble Baroness what I think the answer is, it would be better if I wrote to her  with an answer. As I understand it, there would, of course, be a look by the competition authorities  to see whether this was competitively a good thing, but the Secretary of State could invite the competition authorities&#151;the OFT&#151;to look at the non-competition issues as well and report. Ultimately, it would be for the Secretary of State to decide whether&#151;even if the competition side of it was okay, if the non-competition side was not, regarding national security&#151;it would be within his power to take action. He would have to do it in a proportionate and reasonable way. That is probably an accurate answer, but the noble Baroness deserves more than that, which is why I intend to write to her if she will allow me to do so.</p>

The Committee will be familiar with the European law in relation to big mergers in Europe, and we are familiar with legislation in this country. Where it falls between is where it is a world issue.

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000070"></a>I will make two or three things clear. First, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, possibly felt that I sounded like a protectionist, a little Englander or maybe both. I am a businessman. I have earned my living as a businessman for 50 years; there is not a protectionist bone in my body, but I am a realist. I am a realist who has worked in the global environment, and I have no doubt whatsoever about what a tough old world it is out there.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, rightly talked about sovereign wealth funds. Any nation, particularly ours, should make itself fully aware of the implications of the new global environment in which sovereign wealth funds, and many other forms of investor that do not conform to our notion of transparency or good governance, are predators; the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned one possible predator. To pretend that that is not the case, or that if you allow some of these people a glimmer of an opportunity they will not leap through that gap, is nave in the extreme. I am very reassured. It is certainly the first time I have heard any government Minister lay out the procedures. They sound pretty robust.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80701-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="80701-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000072"></a>I referred to other western European democracies and the United States. All of them are rapidly moving towards a point where they can look through deals and ownerships to see the real owners and the real purpose behind deals. We have been laggards on this, and have almost begun to make ourselves a lone voice in saying that you can go too far in looking through deals. I am not sure that that is the case. In that sense, perhaps I do sound like a protectionist&#151;for which I do not apologise because mine is a real-world view.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000073"></a>I suspect that I will not come back with the amendment as it is, but I would like to think about taking the Ofgem components and eliding them with the general amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, on Ofgem&#146;s remit to see if we cannot get into the Bill many of the things that the Minister made clear. There is a win here for all of us, which will not be this amendment. Frankly, I am very grateful.</p>

<a name="80701-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0807021000074"></a>Lastly, I am a disciple of John Kenneth Galbraith; it may be my age. Many of my views on the new global environment are shared by extremely reputable and recognised economists. I am not alone in this. The world is changing rapidly, and it is time for us to look more closely at whether we are semi-consciously drifting into the type of economy that the United States became in the late 19th and early 20th century, from which it eventually had to jolt itself and resile. I hope that that will not be the case in this country, but I am concerned about this drift. I am sure that I will

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08070182000022"></a>The House will recall that on 29 April 2008, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) announced the deployment of the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles (2 Rifles) to Kosovo during June as part of our existing commitment to the NATO/EU shared pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF).</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08070182000023"></a>During this period, the security situation in Kosovo has remained calm.  There were no significant incidents of interethnic unrest, and a number of key political dates passed peacefully.  In particular, the implementation of a new constitution represented an historic moment in Kosovo&#146;s progress towards establishing itself as a stable, democratic and multiethnic state.</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08070182000024"></a>Against this background, NATO has now assessed that its Kosovo force has the capability to maintain a safe and secure environment without further recourse to the ORF.  As a result, I am pleased to announce that 2 Rifles completed its mission on 30 June 2008 and is in the process of returning to UK.  The UK will, however, remain committed to the NATO/EU pan-Balkans ORF until the end of this year, at a lower readiness.</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08070182000025"></a>The deployment of the UK ORF battalion confirmed yet again the professionalism of our Armed Forces and demonstrated our commitment to the security of Kosovo during a politically sensitive period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08070182000037"></a>Since the publication of <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System </I>in October 2007, my department has been engaging with stakeholders on our longer-term transport strategy post-2014.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08070182000038"></a>In this initial phase of work, views on the goals and challenges that potential transport policies should help meet have been obtained from over 250 organisations throughout the country, as well as from over 600 members of the public who have participated in citizens&#146; panels.

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08070182000041"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that the department is releasing the final report of the mild traumatic brain injury project team established by the Surgeon General in June 2007.  A copy will also be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08070182000042"></a>I previously informed the House of the conclusions of the project team in my Written Ministerial Statement on 15 January 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 23-24WS).  Release of the final report provides further rationale and explanation of the key conclusions that:</p>
there is no evidence that mTBI is having an adverse effect on operational capability within the UK Armed Forces;the majority of cases of mTBI become symptom-free within two to three weeks and 80 per cent are symptom-free within three months; and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) has identified 585 cases of casualties between February 2003 and November 2007 with traumatic brain injury (whether mild, moderate or severe) out of some 36,000 referrals to deployed UK operational emergency departments. This represents 1.6 per cent of all medical presentations during the period, and 0.5 per cent of the deployed UK military population.
<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08070182000043"></a>The report also provides further detail of the actions we have already taken to address mBTI, including the rollout of a diagnostic and surveillance tool to deployed theatres, and the establishment of a treatment protocol covering information for deployed service personnel, telephone-based support for patients, and outpatient and inpatient treatment at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court which becomes the DMS lead centre for mTBI, re-enforced by ongoing epidemiological and research findings.</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08070182000044"></a>The report also describes current research in mTBI relevant to the military environment under way at DSTL, South Tees NHS Trust emergency department, and King&#146;s College London. </p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08070182000045"></a>Finally, the report and associated historical review and literature review documents&#151;will be placed in the Library of the House.  They provide a sense of perspective, explaining that mTBI is almost certainly not a new phenomenon, and that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions between organic and psychological effects in the case of brain injury.</p>

<a name="80701-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08070182000046"></a>As I explained in my previous Statement, research continues both here and in the US.   Throughout our research, we are in touch with United States developments, and collaborate with its researchers as appropriate.  I shall keep the House informed of any further significant developments. </p>

The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. Under this process it is for airspace change sponsors, for example NATS, to develop and consult on proposals. Detailed guidance is given on what impacts are to be taken into account, how they should be measured and who should be consulted. Informed by the consultation, the sponsor submits the proposal to the CAA's directorate of airspace policy for assessment against regulatory requirements. In determining whether to accept or reject a proposal, the CAA's process reflects the Secretary of State for Transport's directions and guidance to the CAA on the exercise of its statutory duties and environmental objectives.</p>

<a name="80701w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_80"></a><a name="08070176000154"></a>Drink drive, &#163;3.6 million. There are two campaigns a year, in June and December. Our primary target audience is male drivers under the age of 30 and the strategy is to make them believe there is a strong likelihood that they will get caught if they drive over the legal alcohol limit and to inform them of the consequences, both legal and to the quality of their life, of a conviction.</p>

<a name="80701w0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_81"></a><a name="08070176000155"></a>Motorbike safety, &#163;2.5 million. There are two main strands to the motorcycle campaign. The first is aimed primarily at car drivers and consists of a TV commercial prompting them to look out for motorcycles when driving. The second is a sponsorship of British Superbikes and is aimed at leisure bikers.</p>

<a name="80701w0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_82"></a><a name="08070176000156"></a>Speeding, &#163;3 million. We have a TV campaign aimed at all drivers in urban areas which highlights the dangers to pedestrians of exceeding the 30 mph speed limit with the proposition: &#147;Hit a child at 40 mph and she has an 80 per cent chance of being killed, but hit her at 30 mph and she has an 80 per cent chance of surviving&#148;. There is also a campaign on radio and outdoor media highlighting the dangers of driving too fast on rural roads.</p>

<a name="80701w0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_83"></a><a name="08070176000157"></a>Seatbelt wearing, &#163;3 million. A new seatbelt campaign is in development and will be launched in October 2008.</p>

<a name="80701w0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_84"></a><a name="08070176000158"></a>Children, teenagers and parents, &#163;4.1 million. We have campaigns aimed at primary school children designed to help them learn the green cross code and at teenagers reminding them that they should avoid distractions on the roads. We also target parents with the message that children copy behaviours that they see their parents practise, so they should ensure that they always set a good example when using the roads.</p>

This is a matter for the US Administration and the companies involved. It is hoped that the contract with Northrop Grumman teamed with EADS, which involves final assembly of the aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, and manufacture of wing sets by Airbus UK, can be finalised soon.</p>
