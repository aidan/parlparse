<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  My Lords, before public business begins, I take the opportunity to inform the House that I am to address the Yorkshire Business Forum in Leeds tomorrow, Friday, 16th June, when the House will sit. Accordingly I trust that the House will grant me leave of absence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Chalfont </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>What plans they have for the future of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, on 17th April we announced a revised proposal for a public private partnership for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, and published a consultation document. Our proposal would see around three-quarters of the current DERA organisation turned into a company. The remainder of DERA would be retained in the MoD. Formal consultation ended on 9th June. We are considering the responses and hope to make a further announcement before the Summer Recess.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Given that DERA is one of the leading scientific and technological installations in the world, does she agree that this goes rather further than her reply might suggest? A host of questions arises from the plan to privatise three-quarters of DERA; I should like to ask the noble Baroness two.
<P>

<a name="00615-01_para0"></a>First, how will the Government continue to benefit from the scientific and technological research of the privatised part of DERA, where obviously commercial success rather than national security will be the criterion upon which it will work? How has the United States reacted to this in the light of the close collaboration that we have with the Americans in these areas?
<P>

<a name="00615-01_para1"></a>Secondly, what machinery will be established to maintain communications between the private and public sectors to ensure that there is full communication and exchange of ideas between the two sectors?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, as to the noble Lord's second point, we expect close communication between the public and private sectors. The bulk of new DERA's work will continue to come from the MoD for a very long time, and officials in both organisations will be working closely together. As to the benefits that may accrue to the public sector from privatisation, they may be achieved through some kind of "golden share", which the noble Lord will have seen mentioned in the consultation document. We shall develop our thinking on that in the light of the consultation which is taking place. So far as concerns the USA, I am happy to say that it seems broadly content with what Her Majesty's Government are now proposing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </B>   My Lords, the proposals for the partial privatisation of DERA obviously have implications for its research base and thus for those universities which have significant research engagements with the MoD. Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be effective consultation with higher education to prevent unfortunate consequences&#151;whether intended or unintended&#151;on the conduct of research in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that the noble Baroness knows that we have received a contribution from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and from the Defence Scientific Advisory Board, as well as from many other academic groups. I can assure the noble Baroness that their comments will be taken fully into account. I should say to her&#151;as I have to many others with an interest in this matter&#151;that my door will stay open during this period. Should anyone wish to come and give supporting oral evidence to the written evidence they have already given, I shall be glad to see them&#151;within reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, how will the Procurement Agency get impartial scientific advice after privatisation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, that will be given through that part of DERA which will remain as part of the MoD. The noble Lord will have noticed in the consultation document that approximately 900 individuals will be retained within the MoD part of DERA to give the impartial and objective advice that we all recognise will be absolutely vital in the post-privatisation period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister sensitive to the need to ring-fence hitherto classified information? If so, where is the Minister determined to draw that line?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, it was, in part, the MoD's and Ministers' recognition of the importance of ring-fencing that led us to the second bout of consultation that we are currently <P>


<a name="column_1753"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undertaking. The most sensitive areas of DERA will stay entirely within the MoD. Porton Down, about 70 per cent of the Centre for Defence Analysis, the Defence Research Information Centre and the Defence Radiological Protection Service will all stay fully within the MoD.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend said that the Americans were broadly satisfied with what has been proposed. Does she accept that I should be much happier if she could tell the House that the Americans were completely satisfied with what has been proposed in the light of its criticality to our defence interests?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am always conscious of the fact that were I to say that the Americans were completely satisfied one of your Lordships would inevitably pop up and say that he had had a conversation with someone who was not completely satisfied. I can tell the noble Lord that when I discussed this with the former Deputy Defence Secretary, John Hamre, and when I discussed it with the current Defence Secretary, Mr Rudy de Leon, both expressed themselves to be happy with the proposals; indeed, they were very positive. We have had an extremely helpful response from the United States at those official levels.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   My Lords, reference has been made to co-operation with the United States. In view of the growing importance of co-operation with our major European partners, can the Minister say what are the implications of the new hybrid DERA for that co-operation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, in my discussions with my opposite numbers in Europe&#151;with whom I have been having a series of bilateral discussions over the past two or three months&#151;I made it a point to raise with them the proposals put forward by Her Majesty's Government for the future developments in DERA. Considerable interest has been expressed. I understand that today we received an official response from the Government of Germany, and we are expecting an official response from the Government of France. All in all, the proposals have been welcomed by our interlocutors. I do not foresee any "show-stoppers" coming from our colleagues in Europe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, are the Government experiencing any delays in retaining staff at the retained DERA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am unaware of any delays or difficulties in retaining staff in retained DERA. During this period of consultation there is bound to be an element of uncertainty, and staff interests must be treated with the utmost sensitivity. I fully recognise that many people are not quite certain on which side of the line they are likely to fall, or, indeed, may wish to be on the other side of the <P>

<P>
<UL>Whether they will appoint a Minister for men to address the gender-related problems of disadvantaged men.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Cabinet Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, the Government have no plans to do so. The Government believe in removing barriers to achievement wherever they exist. We are aware of the particular problems faced by disadvantaged men and are taking action to address them. For example, the New Deal has already helped over 300,000 young men who were in long-term unemployment. We have introduced the minimum wage and are helping families through the working families' tax credit. We are also carrying out a review of paternity and maternity leave to improve the work/life balance for fathers and families.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for that encouraging reply. I have always been confident that the Government's heart is in the right place, but there must be action. Is the noble and learned Lord aware that in the past 50 years the number of jobs in manufacturing industry has fallen from 5.7 million to 2.9 million, which radically affects the employment opportunities for men, and that today 1.5 million children live in families where no one is employed? Does the noble and learned Lord agree that the state education system has failed to motivate boys to a much greater extent than girls? Is he also aware that last year nearly five times as many boys than girls were found guilty or cautioned in respect of indictable offences, and that nearly twice as many boys were the subject of violent crime? Finally, is the Minister aware that three out of every four suicides in the United Kingdom are men? What action will the Government take to show that they care more about the 49 per cent of voters who are men?

<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am very well acquainted with the figures to which the noble Lord refers. At the heart of the problem of dealing with disadvantaged men and families is the need to provide work for as many people as possible. Since the Government came to power just under 1 million new jobs have been created. Youth unemployment is an incredibly important aspect of the problem to which the noble Lord refers. The New Deal for the under-25s has put on to work 400,000 people, of whom 72 per cent are men. The working families' tax credit is aimed at those who have not worked for a long time and <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>benefit has encouraged them not to work. We are aware of the figures and are determined to provide opportunity for all, particularly in the labour market.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that a few years ago it was reported that the Equal Opportunities Commission had nearly as many cases involving men as women? Can the Minister indicate whether that pattern has continued or been repeated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the law outlaws discrimination against both men and women. I would be very, very surprised if the activities of the EOC were directed much more towards men than women. However, I shall obtain the figures and write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that the aim of the Department for Education and Employment to reduce the number of children excluded from school, who by and large are boys, is likely to be the most effective initiative to socialise young men?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree that to deal with exclusions from school is an incredibly important way to help young men. It is dealing with the problem right from the start that makes the difference, and as to that I entirely share the views of my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the major problems here is the cultural shift away from traditional male-dominated types of employment that involve physical strength? The jobs which have replaced them tend to require academic skills or are of low status. Should we not concentrate on that cultural aspect which makes groups of traditionally working-class men very much less susceptible to the new job opportunities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that the shift in jobs prejudices men to the extent that the noble Lord suggests. For example, virtually all the growth in computing occupations is filled by men. Although I agree that some consideration should be given to the issues raised by the noble Lord in relation to the new kinds of jobs, it is not all one way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord explain further how the Government are to deal with some very serious statistics that have been identified? Boys fall about 11 per cent behind girls at GCSEs, and they also fall behind at A-level. There is considerable evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, pointed out, that in families without fathers boys are seriously handicapped. It is not a question of money but of having a father in the home.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we could not agree more with the impact and importance of the presence of a father to participate fully in the bringing <P>

Last year's theme was Boys, Young Men and Fathers and grants were given to a number of schemes. I give three examples: Families Need Fathers; Fathers Direct; and the YMCA's Dads and Lads project. All of those are designed to promote the role of the father in the family.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, if by chance the Government change their mind and appoint a Minister for men will they ensure that that individual, unlike the Minister for Women, can tell the difference between private and public education?

<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, that seems to have very little to do with the Question.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy for funding hospices.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, the funding of hospices is a matter for local decision. Successive guidance has made clear to the NHS its responsibilities for commissioning palliative care services to meet the assessed health needs of their local communities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Is he aware that, for example, in 1999-2000 in the Yorkshire group of the voluntary hospice movement there was a fall in NHS funding of hospices which varied between 1 and 5 per cent, depending on the particular health authority concerned? Is my noble friend also aware of growing concern in the hospice movement that there may be even greater variation once the responsibility for funding is transferred to primary care groups and trusts? Is it possible to have an earmarked percentage funding of all hospices across the board?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords accept that the work of hospices is invaluable to the country. At the moment the NHS provides about 31 per cent of the revenue funding of hospices. I accept that there is a variation in the funding of individual hospices which very much reflects both local circumstances and the individual funding positions of those hospices. I believe that the best way round such problems is for every health authority to develop a palliative care strategy which enables these kinds of debates to take place at local level. I am sure that as a result of those debates satisfactory conclusions can be reached between individual hospices, health authorities and primary care groups.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is well aware of the concern of Members of this House about the funding of hospices, particularly since the end of ring-fenced funding six years ago. He is also aware that many noble Lords do not believe that the health improvement programme will necessarily lead to the level of hospice funding that is required. In the debate on this subject on 1st March the Minister promised that the decision-making process of health authorities would be reviewed. Can the noble Lord tell the House what progress he is making in that respect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we believe that the development by every health authority of a palliative care strategy, aligned with a health improvement programme, is the way to ensure an agreed programme of support at local level, where the particular needs of hospices can be discussed alongside the development of palliative care services within the NHS. Since that debate I understand that one-third of health authorities have not yet developed those strategies. We shall make absolutely clear to health authorities that we expect those strategies to be developed as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew15"></A><B> The Duke of Norfolk: </B>   My Lords, before I ask my question, I should mention that my wife founded a charity called Help the Hospices which provides a meeting place for hospices in London near King's Cross. It was opened by Her Majesty the Queen the other day. It also holds conferences and trains people in the hospice movement. My question relates to funding. In the voluntary sector only 30 per cent of the expenses are covered by the state. Does the Minister agree that it should be 40 or 50 per cent? As has been said, for children's hospices the figure is only 5 per cent. Again, that should be 40 or 50 per cent. The Government simply must contribute a greater sum to the hospice movement than they do now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, certainly I pay tribute to Help the Hospices because over the years it has done an invaluable job of work. I believe that it is difficult to say what the exact level of NHS support for hospices should be. As the noble Duke says, the current figure is 31 per cent. It is a matter on which decisions must be made locally. The situation at each hospice is different and is best discussed at local level between the health service and the hospice. The development of a palliative care strategy and agreement on a health improvement programme within each health authority area provide the best way forward in dealing with those issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, invaluable though the work of the hospice movement is, many people who are dying and the people who look after them would prefer that to take place in their own homes? Therefore, does he agree that we must consider also the support given in providing palliative care in a domiciliary setting?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Yes, my Lords. I believe that that is absolutely right. There is no doubt that in <P>


<a name="column_1758"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1758</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recent years we have seen the development of many more community services, often based in existing hospices. Those of us who have met the hospice movement recently know that many hospices are keen to develop services in the community. I am sure that that is the way in which those services will develop in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there are very few hospices for children? Because of that, parents, often with other children, must travel long distances. Can he help with the funding of the travelling expenses of those parents and perhaps encourage more hospices to be established locally?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I believe that a number of points arise here. With regard to the number of children's hospices, my view is that, as my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley suggested, we need to encourage the development of many more community-based services in order to avoid, if at all possible, the need to travel long distances. Because hospices are in the independent sector, decisions with regard to support for travel costs must rest with the arrangements of the individual organisations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Birmingham: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if there is insufficient support from public funds for hospices, which do an absolutely marvellous job, pressure is likely to fall back on the general wards of ordinary hospitals where people are, in point of experience, likely to die with less dignity and less support than in hospices?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the whole development of palliative care services needs to be seen as a partnership between the National Health Service and the independent sector. There is no doubt that the NHS has learned much from the independent sector about palliative care services and, of course, has developed many services within its own NHS hospitals. I should not want to underestimate the high quality work that is being done there. However, I certainly accept the substantive point that the NHS needs to provide support to the hospice movement. I believe that 31 per cent of revenue costs is a reasonable base line. However, at the end of the day those matters must be decided locally on the basis of an agreed palliative care strategy.

The aim is to minimise the risk of significant disorder involving England supporters. A copy of the measures taken in preparation for Euro 2000 was placed in the Library of the House on 2nd June.

<a name="00615-03_para0"></a>The Government were pleased to note that England's opening game involved no public order problems. The mayor of Eindhoven and the police commander praised England supporters and the degree of co-operation provided by the United Kingdom authorities and police teams operating in the host countries. No one can afford to be complacent in these matters, particularly as the high-risk England v. Germany match lies ahead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I am sure that he will want to take this opportunity to wish England well in our match against Germany on Saturday. However, is he not concerned that that game is to be played in a stadium which is wholly unsuitable for a match of this importance and which, had it been located in Great Britain, would not have received a safety certificate? Therefore, what representations have the Government made to have the match moved from Charleroi to another, more suitable location?
<P>

<a name="00615-03_para1"></a>On the wider issue of crowd violence, is he aware that those of us who in the past have followed England abroad all too frequently have been sickened by the behaviour of a small number of so-called England supporters? Is he also aware that, for the life of us, we cannot understand why it is impossible for people who are known to the National Criminal Intelligence Service to be prevented from travelling abroad when they have a known record of crowd violence at home?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I believe that it is well known that the Government made representations concerning the choice and selection of venue. We certainly raised the question of the Charleroi stadium being used for the high-profile match with Germany. Ultimately, of course, rightly the decision must be made by the tournament organisers. We have tried to play a constructive role and have concentrated our efforts on doing all that we possibly can to ensure the maintenance of law and order during the tournament.
<P>

<a name="00615-03_para2"></a>I agree entirely with my noble friend's final point. As noble Lords know, the Government were determined to do all that they could to strengthen and toughen the legislation which covers football hooliganism. Our original intention was to have far wider powers to confiscate passports from known and suspected hooligans in particular so that they could be prevented from travelling abroad. Sadly, we were prevented from extending the law in that way, not by our own ill-doings but by Members of the Opposition, who were determined to wreck the legislation when it passed <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>through another place. No doubt we shall return to this issue when we have reflected fully on the way in which the legislation works currently and has worked during Euro 2000.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, should not the Minister recall that, following the violence at the World Cup, two years ago during the passage of the Crime and Disorder Bill in 1998 this party proposed football behaviour orders which would have allowed the police to apply to magistrates for restrictions on hooligans who were likely to cause violence. At that time, the Home Secretary rejected the idea but said that the Government would consider it. A year ago, the relevant Minister said that they would do something, but still the Government have done nothing. So far as concerns the Private Member's Bill, that was not wrecked by Conservatives; indeed, it was a Conservative Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely interested in and entertained by what the noble Lord says on the matter. It is indeed the case that the issue was raised some two years ago. When a government-supported Private Member's Bill was brought before another place and passed through this House, Messrs David Maclean, Eric Forth, Roger Gale and, I believe, Edward Leigh and Michael Fabricant, waving his passport, said that these were liberties which should not be taken away. I believe that David Maclean said that there would be European Court of Human Rights implications in the move to take away passports. I fail to understand why some Members of the Opposition appear to be more interested in the civil liberties and rights of known football hooligans than in the civil liberties and rights of those who want honourably to watch football matches in peace.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say whether the advice given to football supporters not to travel to games if they do not have a ticket is being heeded? If not, what is being done to reinforce that message?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have been passing on that message. We have made a number of moves and given great support to the Football Association, the Football Supporters Association and to those other supporters' associations that are independent in order to discourage people from travelling to matches without tickets. The success of the police operation in Eindhoven over the weekend and on Monday bears testament to the active support that the police here have given.
<P>

<a name="00615-03_para3"></a>The supporters who were in Eindhoven on Monday are to be congratulated on their good behaviour. I hope that that good behaviour extends to the next match against Germany, which I hope to enjoy myself. I shall watch carefully to ensure that the security arrangements for that match are thorough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Watson of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, given the widespread, fervent hope in your Lordships' House <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that violence will be avoided in Euro 2000, does the Minister share the concern that is now publicly and widely expressed about television advertisements planned by Sega for the promotion of an online console game, in which supporters of the different teams shout abuse at each other and provoke violence? Does he share the concern of the Guardian, which referred to that television advertisement with the words, "This incendiary scenario", and can he do anything about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I shall study carefully what the noble Lord has said. I share some of his concerns about advertising of that nature and I shall look into the matter.

<P>

<a name="00615-03_para4"></a>This is the second consolidation Bill that has been brought before your Lordships this Session. It consolidates the legislation on European parliamentary elections, at present to be found, principally, in the European Parliamentary Elections Acts of 1978, 1993 and 1999.
<P>

<a name="00615-03_para5"></a>The Bill is pure consolidation. It does not change the law on European parliamentary elections and, therefore, it does not raise any of the issues on this subject which have been of such interest to your Lordships in the past two Sessions.
<P>

<a name="00615-03_para6"></a>The Government support the important work of the Law Commission and parliamentary counsel in ensuring that legislation is easy to find and easy to follow. I commend the latest results of their work to your Lordships. If your Lordships are content to give this Bill a Second Reading, it will be referred to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills in the usual way. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene briefly to welcome consolidation in this matter. When noble Lords dealt with the 1999 European Parliamentary Elections Bill, leaving aside the merits&#151;I should really say the "demerits"&#151;of the Bill, one problem was that we were constantly having to refer back to other pieces of legislation. I welcome the fact that the legislation is to be consolidated so that when we come to amend it, to get rid of what proved to be a totally disastrous system of election to the European Parliament, the amendments will be much easier to follow than they would have been without consolidation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, I said that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, would <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>find it quite impossible to remain silent on this totally formal piece of parliamentary business. My comment does not relate to European legislation but to the Scotland Act on which the House had the good fortune to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, for many hours. Had it not been for the generosity of the Government and those sitting on these Benches, there would have been only one directly elected Member of the Scottish Parliament, a matter which he, no doubt, would like to recall when he makes his next speech on a consolidation Bill!

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-04_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment was debated at the very end of the previous session of the Committee stage. The debate came to an abrupt end because I was not satisfied with the answer from the Minister and I sought to test the opinion of the House. Unfortunately, the Government had not retained enough of their supporters to ensure a quorum and the House was counted out&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   Perhaps the noble Baroness can explain why two of her colleagues on the Back Benches, who had taken a keen interest in the Bill, did not vote on that occasion, even though they were in the Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am afraid I find that impossible to explain. It is quite possible that my noble friends were pleased for the House to be counted out. I know not; I am simply supposing.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para7"></a>I do not want to delay your Lordships by repeating everything that I said on that occasion. On re-reading the debate in Hansard, I am still utterly convinced that the principle that I was arguing was correct. That is that if the Post Office engaged in major acquisitions or disposals it should publish details at the earliest opportunity in the same way as though it was a company quoted on the Stock Exchange. I cannot see how that would put it at any disadvantage as the Minister suggested. Such details are published almost on a daily basis by ordinary plcs, if only to ensure that their shareholders are aware of what is going on before they make any decisions about buying or selling. The Government promised us openness in their dealings, and they are offering a regime whereby the public and Parliament will merely be presented with a fait accompli.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para8"></a>I have to tell your Lordships that certain information came to me late yesterday and I have not had a chance to verify it. I have already discussed this matter with the Minister. That information suggests that there is a cogent reason why the Government should have included this matter in the Bill themselves. I hope that the Minister will now agree that the principle is correct and, therefore, that on Report he will put down a government amendment. I believe that it would be ridiculous to pass the Bill in its present form and six months or a year down the line to have to bring it back to deal with this matter.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para9"></a>I await the Minister's response with considerable interest. I hope that he can assure me that he will be able to table an amendment at Report stage. As I told the Minister, if he feels unable to do that, I shall certainly table a re-drafted amendment myself. I accept that the amendment that I had tabled and <P>


<a name="column_1764"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1764</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which was drafted for me by someone who was briefing me on this matter, was rather wider than the Stock Exchange rules would require. If the Minister, on behalf of the Government, feels unable to deal with the matter I shall bring it back in a new form. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   I assume that the answer to the question posed by the noble Baroness as to why she could not maintain the necessary quorum when the vote was taken last week was because she made the mistake of saying that this amendment was my idea, despite the fact that I happened to be out of the country. Indeed, it was a point that I made at Second Reading, as the noble Baroness kindly indicated. I agree with much of what was said in the previous debate. I also agree with the Minister's comment because the amendment, as drafted by the noble Baroness and as she has indicted, would go too far and would put the Post Office at more of a commercial disadvantage than I had intended when I made the point at Second Reading. I do not wish to detain the House and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   This issue appears to be a matter of timing. When we last debated this, the Minister pointed out that he was seeking to establish a level playing field with the rest of industry. I take the point and I readily understand it. None the less, as my noble friend has said, occasions do arise in a commercial situation, in particular towards the end of the process, when shareholders are informed. I see absolutely no reason why Parliament and others should not be informed at roughly the same point were a disposal, share exchange or other business move planned by the Post Office with the agreement of the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Baroness was not overly enthusiastic about my response when we last discussed this. However, I think that very little separates the noble Baroness and myself on this point, although we take a different view on the details.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para10"></a> The noble Baroness has said that the key issue here is transparency and I have no quarrel whatever with the notion that the Post Office company should be as transparent as any listed company in the kind of transactions that are described in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para11"></a>Where I part company with the noble Baroness is on what those listing rules require. The listing rules require that a company, in certain circumstances, announces on acquisition, once the terms of such a transaction have been agreed. The amendment talks in terms of announcing details when the company proposes a transaction. As I said last week, no other commercial company would be required to publish its intentions to acquire or dispose of any undertaking in the way that would be required by this amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para12"></a>In seeking to give the Post Office&#151;and the future Post Office company&#151;the greater commercial freedom that everyone agrees is necessary, we are endeavouring to transform the Post Office company <P>


<a name="column_1765"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1765</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into a commercial company, governed by normal company legislation. It is our intention that the Post Office should provide transparent information on completed acquisitions along the lines of the London Stock Exchange disclosure requirements. The Post Office is now doing so. I hope that this gives the kind of assurance that the noble Baroness seeks.
<P>

<a name="00615-04_para13"></a>Perhaps I may make one further point very clear. If it appears that what we are proposing falls in any way short of the London Stock Exchange disclosure requirements, we shall certainly look at the issue again. I trust that this explanation gives sufficient comfort to enable the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I have to say that I shall read yet again the remarks made by the Minister. I am not sure if what he has stated in fact guarantees that the Government will table an amendment on Report. He referred to a point that was mentioned on the last occasion; namely, that the Government expect the Post Office to be transparent and to release information according to the rules of the London Stock Exchange. But the Bill does not require that.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para0"></a>So far as concerns this side of the House, it is essential that this provision is written into the Bill. Perhaps the Minister did not hear what I said in my earlier remarks. I said that the amendment I have tabled today is not the amendment that I would bring back at the next stage. This amendment is rather wider than the London Stock Exchange rules. If it is necessary for me to return to this matter, I shall bring back an amendment that reflects exactly those rules so that a level playing field is established, not only for the Post Office but also for any other company that wishes to compete in this area.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para1"></a>I hope that the Minister will bring back a government amendment on Report, but I shall ensure that I have an amendment prepared. While not wishing to sound in any way threatening&#151;I would not dream of doing such a thing&#151;I shall have my amendment ready. At the appropriate time&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws her amendment, the Minister has said that at the moment the Post Office abides by the Stock Exchange rules as a matter of form. However, is not that a voluntary action? Does the Minister agree that the Post Office should be made to do that by law? Given that, I wish only for more power to my noble friend's elbow.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My noble friend has stated in a clearer form exactly what I was trying to say. The difference between what the Post Office may do according to custom and practice or on advice and what it would have to do according to the law are two quite different things. On that basis, I shall withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="00615-05_para3"></a>Clause 68 [Loans by the Secretary of State to the Post Office company and its subsidiaries]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 70:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 42, line 32, after ("rates") insert ("(being not less than the commercial rates generally payable in the financial markets at the time of making the loans)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para4"></a><P>

<a name="00615-05_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a short and simple amendment that seeks to carry into law what the Government have already stated in their White Paper. For that reason, I believe it to be a very important amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para6"></a>The White Paper recognised that retained earnings would be insufficient to finance new investment. There would therefore be two means of borrowing open to the Post Office. First, up to &#163;75 million a year for the next five years from the Government with minimal ministerial approval being required. Secondly, for anything in excess of &#163;75 million per annum, the Government have promised,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a fast track, but rigorous, Ministerial approval process",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para7"></a>
 to be completed within 28 days so long as it poses no undue risk to the taxpayer. Here I detect the ability for a ministerial get-out&#151;a large loophole&#151;but that is not what I intend to discuss today.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para8"></a>The Government have argued that this additional larger-scale funding should come from the National Loans Fund, not from the commercial markets. In the White Paper the Government argued that, even though borrowing from the commercial markets would impose additional disciplines, the markets would regard the borrowing as being underwritten by the Government. Although the Government believe that borrowing from the National Loans Fund,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will be more cost-effective for the taxpayer"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para9"></a>
they conceded that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in order to ensure that the Post Office competes fairly with other postal operators in the private sector; and to reinforce commercial disciplines, the Post Office will borrow at a rate which is broadly comparable to the rate it would be charged in the market without an ... explicit guarantee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para10"></a><P>

<a name="00615-05_para11"></a>The terms of borrowing were discussed at some length in Committee in the other place. The Minister for Competition reasserted that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Borrowing from the National Loans Fund will be at commercial rates to ensure fair competition with private sector companies. There will be no hidden advantage for any of the subsidiaries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para12"></a>
Later in the same debate the Minister reiterated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We will set a commercial rate through the National Loans Fund".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para13"></a><P>

<a name="00615-05_para14"></a>From the White Paper onwards, including all that was said in the other place, it is absolutely clear that the Government want the borrowing to take place at commercial rates. However, although the Government have stated that, the Bill says something else. Clause 68(2) provides that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"interest shall be paid on loans ... at such rates as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, direct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para15"></a><P>


<a name="column_1767"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1767</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Here there is no mention at all of the unsubsidised commercial rate that was referred to elsewhere, only such rates as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, direct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-05_para16"></a><P>

<a name="00615-05_para17"></a>The amendment that I ask the Government to accept today simply puts into the Bill what the Government have on numerous occasions promised Parliament that they would do. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   As the noble Baroness said, the Government set out very clearly their policy on lending to the Post Office in the White Paper. In order to ensure that the Post Office and its subsidiaries compete fairly with other operators in the private sector, and to reinforce commercial disciplines, they will be required to borrow from the National Loans Fund at a rate which is broadly comparable to the rate that would apply in the market.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para18"></a>The Government are currently taking independent advice on the appropriate credit rating that would apply to the Post Office without an explicit or implicit government guarantee and on the appropriate borrowing rates. The rate will be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the National Loans Act 1968 which gives the Treasury the power to set a commercial rate for sums lent from the National Loans Fund. We shall continue to take advice on the appropriate rate to set as necessary in the future and to make the necessary adjustments in the light of market changes.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para19"></a>The rate of interest set by a lender for a commercial company seeking to borrow would depend on the credit rating of the organisation, the exact nature of the borrowing proposal, the current situation in the market and the size and duration of the loan. We intend to replicate that commercial approach and to take these factors into account when determining the appropriate commercial rate for Post Office borrowing.
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para20"></a>Therefore, we are already giving effect to the intent of the amendment of the noble Baroness, as we are following commercial practice in order to ensure that neither the taxpayer nor the Post Office's competitors are disadvantaged. At the same time, there is a case here for some flexibility to be available in situations where non-commercial considerations, or social considerations, could be envisaged. In such cases, we would need flexibility. That is why we are not putting this provision on the face of the Bill. However, I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness that our existing policy achieves her desired intent. In those circumstances, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I wonder whether the Minister could expand on the requirement for flexibility that he identified and used as his defence against putting my noble friend's specific provisions in the Bill. I trust that he will accept that having a commercialised, government-owned company such as the one that we are discussing raises a number of concerns among potential competitors because it seems that this <P>


<a name="column_1768"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1768</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>company is to be given an unfair, state-sponsored advantage, which may cause real competitive difficulties. Does the Minister accept that that is a by-product of the approach that this Government have pursued on the matter?
<P>

<a name="00615-05_para21"></a>What real comfort can be given to potential competitors that the Government will not pursue the easy option and let the Post Office borrow in these circumstances on favourable rates, with an implicit government guarantee that will not be available to competitors?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I do not accept that there are reasons why other operators in this field feel concern about the matter. We have made our policy absolutely crystal clear from the beginning of the process; and, indeed, right throughout it. I have reiterated that policy and said that that is the basis upon which this will be done. I see no reason why there should be concern about the policy. I believe that a degree of flexibility is required in such an organisation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-05_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for taking a moment or two longer on the matter. Can the Minister explain what circumstances he has in mind where such flexibility would need to be given in order to allow the Post Office to borrow on more favourable terms than those which would otherwise be available within the commercial markets? My noble friend's amendment would put what the Minister has expressed as his intention very clearly on the face of the Bill. Noble Lords on this side of the Committee would like to know under exactly what circumstances the noble Lord would need to be flexible. He has his policy, and my noble friend merely wishes to write that on the face of the Bill. The noble Lord said that competitors should not have concerns in this respect, but we need to know why not.

<A NAME="00615-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I have two points to make in response to the noble Viscount. There are obvious areas where one could envisage such a need; for example, a social issue&#151;and we shall be dealing with that in a moment on the question of support for the network. However, if reassurance is required on the matter, I can assure noble Lords that any favourable rates would be constrained as a state aid in these circumstances according to the European situation. Therefore, such flexibility could only be used in very limited circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I have to tell the Minister that I am not at all satisfied with his reply. The bottom line here is the fact that the noble Lord has said on numerous occasions in this Chamber&#151;indeed, this has also been said in the other place&#151;that such borrowing will be conducted on commercial rates. However, he has also said that we cannot put such provision in the Bill because we must have some flexibility. Quite frankly, the noble Lord's explanation as to what that might mean is similarly unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para0"></a>Although I accept that there may have to be the opportunity for subsidies, which I believe we will deal with under Clause 102, we on this side of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Committee would point out that that is because of certain actions that the Government are taking. But, if that has to happen, there is no reason why loans should not be secured on commercial rates. The Bill is supposed not only to safeguard the universal service obligation but also to bring forward competition.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para1"></a>I do not see why competitors should have to borrow on different rates&#151;and that situation could arise if the Minister invokes this flexibility provision. Clause 68(2) very clearly refers to,
<P>

We do not believe that to be correct. I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville </B>   moved Amendment No. 71:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 12, leave out ("this section") and insert ("subsection (1), (2) or (5)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-06_para8"></a><P>

<a name="00615-06_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a minor tidying-up amendment to make it clear that there is no requirement for the Secretary of State to obtain the consent of the Treasury before he consults with the Post Office company&#151;and its subsidiaries, as appropriate&#151;about the exercise of his powers under the clause to extinguish the liabilities of the Post Office company or its subsidiaries. Clause 70 is intended to facilitate the restructuring of the Post Office company's balance sheet on 1st April 2002, as announced in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para10"></a>The requirement for Treasury consent in the clause is there to ensure that the department with the responsibility for the management of public finances gives its consent before any action is taken which might have an effect on the public purse. The amendment ensures that it is only the extinguishment of any liabilities under subsections (1) and (2) and the repeal of the whole clause under subsection (5) which require Treasury consent and not the preceding consultation with the Post Office company. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para11"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<a name="00615-06_para12"></a>Clause 70, as amended, agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dearing </B>   moved Amendment No. 72:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 33, leave out paragraph (f).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-06_para14"></a><P>

<a name="00615-06_para15"></a> The noble Lord said: In moving my maiden amendment I shall not presume to divide the Committee on this great matter. Nevertheless, I shall seek to persuade the Minister.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para16"></a>The paragraph that the amendment would delete has the effect, as I understand it, that the equity that the Government put into the new company shall count against the limits on the Government's financial arrangements set out in subsection (1). My concern, which I am sure many Members of the Committee, if not all, will share, is that when the company is created it should be one that will emerge in the liberalised postal market of Europe as one of the main successful players. If we are to achieve that, and if the Post Office is to enter into partnership agreements with other players, it must do so from a position of negotiating strength, and to that end it will need a strong balance sheet.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para17"></a>I asked the Government whether they would look at this issue when they decided the balance sheet, and I obtained assurances from the noble Lord which I welcomed. Perhaps I owe him an apology for pushing <P>


<a name="column_1772"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1772</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the matter again today. But on rereading the White Paper and what I interpret the Government had to say, and in view of the recent announcements by the commission on its intentions to reduce the monopoly far more than the Government had intended, I thought that we had a new situation and that we ought to think about it.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para18"></a>As I understand it, the White Paper said that the Government were minded to pull out of the Post Office balance sheet the &#163;1.8 billion of retained earnings which have been invested in the National Loans Fund or other government assets over the years and to deprive the Post Office of the income of &#163;107 million a year that derives from those investments.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para19"></a> If that were to happen, then it follows that the balance sheet of this Post Office company, which is going into a much more competitive world, will be much weaker than the present balance sheet. The main British competitor in that market would be correspondingly weakened and, in my view, we should be doing the national interest a disservice.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para20"></a>The world in which the Post Office will be operating will be an increasingly competitive one. There will be growing competition from the new technologies. Twelve years ago, when I was chairman, I was already apprehensive about the long-term implications to the post of new technology. It can only be a matter of time before it begins to impact.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para21"></a>The new technology is disturbing the operations of the post offices and sub-post offices. We expressed concern at Second Reading about the intentions of the Department of Social Security to pay people's pensions through the banks. I read that it places one third of Counters business at risk. It is a serious competitive issue. But the competitive issue I have in mind in the light of the aspirations of the Commission relates to the core postal business.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para22"></a>The Post Office said in a public statement on 30th May that if the Commission has its way&#151;that is, it reduces the monopoly to 50 grams compared with the Government's intention of 150 grams (the present weight is 350 grams)&#151;then the Royal Mail would lose all its profit. If, at the same time, we are weakening the balance and taking away an income of &#163;107 million, how will the Post Office compete effectively? How will it enter into negotiation with collaborative businesses from a base of strength? FedEx has a capitalisation of &#163;7 billion; UPS has a capitalisation of &#163;45 billion. I remember from my days in the Post office that the Dutch Post Office was a particularly entrepreneurial, strong, competitive organisation. Now it has acquired TNT it is doubly strong.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para23"></a>The postal market of Europe will be highly competitive. In a few years there will be only three or four major players. My concern is that Britain should have one of those major players. Directly relevant to that is the strength of the balance sheet. I am sure that the Government will take a forward-looking view rather than looking to the past; that they will want to ensure that the Post Office is strong and that they will want to take into account the implications of the Commission's proposals and thus what may happen to the Counters <P>


<a name="column_1773"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1773</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>business. I hope that they will reflect on whether it is right to withdraw that &#163;1.8 billion or, if they must withdraw some, will only withdraw that element of it which they have said it would be right to take as dividends in the future; that is, 40 per cent, perhaps abated by the 20 per cent that has already been taken.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para24"></a>That is my main point of substance. Of course, the amendment seeks to omit the paragraph. Perhaps that is a touch optimistic. But if we want this to be a strong balance sheet, we should not count against that limit the initial capitalisation of the Post Office in setting up the company and regard that limiting sum as available for subsequent injections.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para25"></a>I cannot compete in knowledge with the Minister on balance sheet structuring. I am an amateur. But I have a certain amount of Treasury experience. One can liken the Treasury in mythology to the dragon Fafner. But where is the Siegfried who can outface the dragon once it has taken the reserves of the Post Office? The dragon defends the public sector borrowing requirements against all Siegfrieds. So have a care in sacrificing the Post Office.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para26"></a>If the Treasury dragon were the only one, terrified though I am of its powers, I would be less anxious. But I am aware that the UPS has appealed to the Commission in relation to what it alleges to be unfair support from the German Government to the Bundespost. It will be vigilant about any new capital that the Government puts in. So if they wish to serve the national interest well, they will take care to ensure that the balance sheet of the new company is a strong one. We hope that they will be prepared to learn from Europe and be much as the French Government are as Europeans; that is, concerned at all costs to serve their national interest. In our case, that is the British interest.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_time2"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, wants the Post Office company to emerge from the current reform process in a strong position to recapture the commercial ground it has lost in past years and with the ability to become one of the most successful postal operators in Europe. I agree that we need to look forward to the situation in the future, rather than backwards to the history of the Post Office in the past.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para27"></a>The noble Lord also expressed his concern during the Second Reading debate that whether or not the Post Office company is able to be successful in the new environment will depend very much on the framework within which it will operate. That is correct.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para28"></a>As I said when I repeated a Statement to the House in December 1998, and the Government restated in the White Paper in July 1999, the Post Office company's balance sheet will be restructured by 1st April 2002 in order to place the company on a more commercial footing, and one where it can be better benchmarked against its competitors. We have had preliminary discussions with our advisers about the issues involved with the restructuring and agreed a preliminary <P>


<a name="column_1774"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1774</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>workplan. I emphasise, however, that no decisions have been taken at this early stage as we intend to consider all the issues thoroughly and to hold discussions with the Post Office before reaching any final conclusion.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para29"></a>We will also need to consider how the development of the Post Office's business between now and the deadline for restructuring on 1st April 2002 might affect the final decisions about the shape of the balance sheet. I therefore cannot speculate at this stage on what the final outcome might be. But we understand that the Post Office company must be equipped to develop its business if it is to provide the postal services that will be needed by its customers. That may well involve forging new alliances and commercial partnerships with those having complementary skills.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para30"></a> So we are fully aware of, and committed to, the need for the Post Office company to have a fair commercial balance sheet which gives it both the incentive to perform and the financial scope to enhance its business. In those circumstances, some might ask why we intend to deprive the Post Office company of previously earned assets as part of the restructuring exercise. But, as I said earlier, we intend to put the Post Office company on a more normal commercial footing. In a normal business, money that the Post Office has put into gilts and other deposits with the National Loans Fund would have been paid to the owner as dividends, rather than being allowed to accumulate on the balance sheet. The Post Office company will therefore cease to hold, and have access to the interest from, the present level of accumulated EFL surpluses as part of the exercise to restructure the balance sheet. The business will then operate and report on the same basis as a private sector one. But as I have already said, no decisions have been taken at this early stage.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para31"></a>Under the policy of allowing the Post Office greater commercial freedom, we have already put in place the new financial regime which will provide the opportunity for the Post Office to fund its commercial development, allowing the Post Office to retain more of its profits; to have automatic access to &#163;75 million each year to fund growth investments and to borrow larger sums to fund growth investments providing the proposals are consistent with the strategic plan, commercially robust and pose no undue risk to the taxpayer. These provisions already provide the Post Office with the springboard to move towards its goal of becoming a world-class distribution company.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para32"></a>There should also be no anxiety about whether the current ceiling on the financial arrangements with government would be sufficient to allow the Post Office company to make a major acquisition. The figure of &#163;5,000 million is a sensible limit, based on a commonly used formula for the present time and the foreseeable future. But we have built flexibility into the clause by providing that the limit may be increased by an order approved in draft for the House of Commons, should this prove necessary in the future. Such an increase would depend on whether it was considered at the time that the Post Office company could sustain a higher limit. I cannot speculate at this stage as to what <P>


<a name="column_1775"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1775</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such a limit might be or the circumstances in which the Post Office company might request the increase. It is worth remembering that not all transactions may be funded by cash but that exchanges of equity might be used to cement alliances.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para33"></a>Perhaps it would be helpful to explain the nature of the purpose of the provision that the noble Lord is seeking to delete. For the purposes of calculating the amount of the outstanding indebtedness to government, Clause 71(2)(f) provides that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sums paid or treated as paid by or on behalf of the Treasury or the Secretary of State in respect of the issue of securities in pursuance of section 63 of this Act or the acquisition of securities in pursuance of section 64 of this Act",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-06_para34"></a>
shall count towards the limit.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para35"></a>Any money required by the Secretary of State or the Treasury to acquire securities or the rights to subscribe to securities will be provided by Parliament. Under company law, the company has a liability to repay the face value of a security to its holder in a similar way to its liability to repay a loan. So in the same way as a loan from the National Loans Fund to the Post Office company or any of its subsidiaries will count in the overall calculation of indebtedness to government, any public money invested in securities of the Post Office company or its subsidiaries will also count in the overall calculation of indebtedness to government, as the face value of the security is effectively repayable to the Government.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para36"></a>However, in the light of the noble Lord's amendment, we are considering whether to bring forward an amendment to modify Clause 71(2)(f) so that sums paid or treated as paid in respect of securities which have been disposed of under Clause 67 do not continue to count against the limit. It would seem wrong in such circumstances that such sums should continue to count against the limit after they have been disposed of and value obtained for them.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para37"></a>I should also like to look further at the interaction between the clause and the shareholders' funds. We need to ensure that there is a limit on the debt owed to government while still allowing the Post Office company sufficient scope for borrowing to develop its business. We will double-check to see whether these provisions are entirely satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="00615-06_para38"></a>I hope that that gives the noble Lord some comfort. I hope that I have reassured him that our intention for the restructuring of the balance sheet is to place the Post Office company on a firm but fair commercial footing, and that we have already put in place provisions for the Post Office company to be able to develop its business and to achieve its strategic objectives. I hope that the noble Lord will continue to want to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="00615-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, rises, perhaps I may say that I am absolutely amazed by the Minister's answer. I said rather cheekily on Second Reading that I had the habit of privately marking his speeches. I shall not bore the House with the mark that I have given the one we have just heard, but he made the most extraordinary comment. He said <P>


<a name="column_1776"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1776</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the balance sheet would be restructured, as we all know, by 2002. He then said that no decisions had been taken at this early stage. "No decisions" presumably means no decisions. Why then are the Government boxing themselves in by including anything at this stage in subsection (2)? Why are they not reserving their position and doing so by order when they believe it to be necessary much later in the process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Further to the points made by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, the Minister explained briefly where the figure of the &#163;5 billion came from. He said that it was the result of a commonly used formula. Perhaps the Minister would let the Committee know, in slightly more detail, where the &#163;5 billion comes from, because I believe that without that it is very difficult to interpret the degree to which subsection (2)(f) is important and what percentage of the total that might comprise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   I owe the Committee an apology. Before speaking I should have declared an interest as a Post Office pensioner. I now do so. In thanking the Minister&#151;and I do so most sincerely because I welcome his agreement to look at a couple of points&#151;I should like to ask him not to give an answer now but to reflect on whether a private sector company, such as one he knows well, would have distributed that &#163;1.8 billion or whether it is more normally the custom of such companies to retain perhaps 60 per cent&#151;a goodly percentage&#151;of the surpluses for future investment; and, believe me, the Post Office will need to make major investments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment, will the Minister answer the question that my noble friend Lord Goshen asked a few moments ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I should be delighted to do so. Let me first of all deal with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, made about the payment of dividends. Except in the case of a private company, most of those sums of money would have been paid out as a dividend. But clearly some of it would have been retained for the purposes of investment. I do not think that that is in dispute between us. That is why a careful decision has to be made about where the line is drawn on this issue.
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para0"></a>I turn to the question of how we arrived at the figure of &#163;5,000 million as the current limit on the total indebtedness to the Government. We sought advice from our financial advisers, Deloitte & Touche, as to an appropriate figure for the limit on the total indebtedness to the Government. I think that one will find that a conventional indebtedness restriction imposed by the articles of association of nearly all public companies is a multiple of their adjusted share capital and reserves. Typically, large companies have multiples of between 1.75 and 2.5 times that baseline.
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para1"></a>The report and accounts of the Post Office for the year ended March 1999 shows that there were reserves of approximately &#163;4,300 million, including holdings of <P>


<a name="column_1777"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1777</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>National Loans Fund deposits and gilts of about &#163;2,500 million. In advance of any detailed decisions on the agreed restructuring of the Post Office company's balance sheet, we took it as a reasonable assumption that the balance sheet would have neither investments nor debt at the time of its reconstruction. This would imply shareholders' funds of about &#163;2,000 million, assuming no further revaluation of assets. Taking the usual multiple of 2 to 2.5 times shareholders' funds produces a range on the indebtedness limitation of &#163;4,000 million to &#163;5,000 million. We have taken the top end of that range for the purposes of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   The Minister was generous in answering my noble friend. I did actually ask him why subsection (2) was needed at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It is a matter of common prudence that there should be restrictions on this process, even if there is considerable room within those restrictions. We cannot have a situation where there is no limitation on the amount of money that could be put into the Post Office. That would seem to me to show a complete lack of regard for financial control from the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I did not make myself clear the first time. Given that the restructuring is not going to be completed and the Government will not have made a decision until the spring of 2002, why are they boxing themselves in now; why do they not reserve the power to themselves to do this by order at a later stage when they do know what they are doing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It seems to me sensible. Again and again in this Chamber, the issue has been raised that certain parameters should be put around these issues. This is a clear and sensible parameter in view of the general situation. Within those general parameters there is scope to have a series of different combinations of debt and equity in the balance sheet. At one and the same time, that provides flexibility in the light of what we might want to do at a particular moment and keeps parliamentary control over the total sum involved.
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para2"></a>In answer to the noble Lord's amendment, I have agreed to look at the matter again in order to ensure that the interaction between the clause he highlighted and the overall figure made sense in the total picture.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As far as we can tell at the moment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-07_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 73, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 128, 133 and 134. They relate to tax provisions, in particular value added tax. The purpose of the tax provisions is to ensure that the transfer of properties, rights and liabilities from the Post Office to the Post Office company under Clause 62 are tax neutral. This means that under the provisions, the Post Office company will not receive any tax disadvantage as a result of the transfer or any tax advantage.
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para9"></a>Amendment No. 73 is a deeming provision which has the effect that, on or after the appointed day mentioned in Clause 62, the Post Office company will be treated for all purposes of value added tax as if it were the same person as the Post Office. This will mean, for example, that no charges will arise from changes to the Post Office's VAT group.
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para10"></a>Amendment No. 133 amends the references to the "Post Office" in the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 to the "Post Office company". Amendment No. 128 means that any amendment made to subordinate legislation by virtue of Schedule 8 to the Bill, such as the amendment to the VAT regulations 1995, does not prejudice the ability to make future changes to that subordinate legislation under existing powers
<P>

<a name="00615-07_para11"></a>Amendment No. 134 relates to rural rate relief for post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997 that applies to Scotland. This amendment substitutes references to the Post Office and the Post Office Act 1953 which are used to define a post office qualifying for rural rate relief with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a universal service provider (within the meaning of the Postal Services Act 2000) and in connection with the provision of a universal postal service (within the meaning of that Act)".

<a name="00615-07_para12"></a><P>

<a name="00615-07_para13"></a>The amendments should ensure that existing post offices operated by the Post Office continue to be eligible for rural rate relief after the transfer to the Post Office company.

<a name="00615-07_para15"></a> I was somewhat confused because I cannot see in Schedule 8 a single statutory instrument that is done away with. I can see all kinds of enactments which are changed by virtue of Schedule 8, but with the exception of the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order, which is the equivalent of a Northern Ireland Act of Parliament, I can see nothing. Can the Minister help me out?

<A NAME="00615-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Amendment No. 128 means that any amendment made to subordinate legislation by virtue of Schedule 8 to the Bill, such as the amendments to the VAT regulations 1995, does not prejudice the ability to make future changes to that subordinate legislation under existing powers. Therefore, it refers to an amendment, of which Schedule 8 almost entirely comprises.

<A NAME="00615-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Given what the Minister and I have said, and given the fact that at any point any amending order can be made to a previous order, why is the amendment necessary? I do not understand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   It is necessary in order to ensure that the ability to make future changes is not prejudiced. It is limited in that way.

<a name="00615-08_para16"></a>The Minister for Competition indicated that he accepted that this Bill might need further clarification as to what constituted reasonable excuse, but as he considered that the drafting of this particular amendment needed some improvement my honourable friend withdrew it against the Minister's promise to consider the issue carefully with a view to making amendments on Report. On Report and at Third Reading the Minister said that he would have been delighted to have come to Report stage with the required amendment because we need one.

<a name="00615-08_para18"></a>Due to the technical nature of the provisions of Amendment No. 75, commercial operators may still not be entirely clear what would be the scope of their responsibilities and powers. What would they do if they thought that a packet contained, for example, a bomb or drugs or pornographic material? The current provision could lead to considerable uncertainty until the matter came before a court, which is clearly undesirable.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para19"></a>The proposed amendment would provide additional guidance as to what might be a reasonable excuse without limiting the court's power to extend the definition. The amendment would reduce the risk to some slight extent that a postal operator's actions, however well intentioned, might be considered unlawful.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para20"></a>I hope that the Government will accept my amendment as a constructive addition to the very necessary provision that they brought forward and added to the Bill, at our suggestion, much earlier during its passage. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I understand that in the other place an amendment similar to this sparked a useful discussion over these clauses. The Government promised to bring forward amendments to clarify what would be a "reasonable excuse" for the purposes of Clauses 83 and 84 and they have now done so. These are Amendments Nos. 74 to 78 and they have already been approved. They take care of the position of any constable or the Commissioners of Customs and Excise that are mentioned in this amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para21"></a> However, we do not believe that it would be right to allow specific exclusion from committing an offence to persons generally, whether engaged in the business of a postal operator or not, who open postal packets because they suspect they contain goods which are illegal. There is already provision in Clause 105 for a postal operator to detain and open a postal packet if he knows or reasonably suspects that it is being sent in contravention of Clause 85 of the Bill, which would cover many illegal goods. As regards the public generally, I am not saying that there may not be cases where suspicion that the packet contains illegal goods would be regarded as a reasonable excuse for opening a packet, but it would depend on the circumstances of the individual case. This is already provided for in Clauses 83 and 84. However, this amendment would provide an easy defence to anyone who wished to open a postal packet. It would be difficult to prove that a person did not have a suspicion if that is what they claimed. The public has a right to expect that their postal packets will only be opened by responsible authorities or in exceptional circumstances. This amendment would threaten that. I therefore ask the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="00615-08_para27"></a>The system whereby the King's letters to his subjects were carried by relays of couriers was instituted as long ago as the 15th century. It was first organised on a regular basis in 1510, when Sir Brian Tuke was appointed as "Master of the King's Post". Please note the phrase "The King's Post".
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para28"></a>In 1591 regulations were published confining the right to carry mail to authorised persons only. This developed into a monopoly in 1609 when it was decreed that only persons directly authorised by the Postmaster General could carry or deliver letters. The Postal Act 1635 confirmed the monopoly in 1609.

<a name="00615-08_para37"></a> The reason why I have troubled your Lordships with this long history is this: the 1969 Act was preceded by the inevitable White Paper. The White Paper contained the same provisions about the continued use of the words "Royal Mail", the Crown and the Royal Cypher, and the depiction of the Queen's head on postage stamps as appears at the end of the current White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para38"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 80, is to ensure that the ancient title of "Post Office" should only be used by the new plc to be established under Section 62 of this Bill. It cannot be right that any new universal postal provider authorised by this Bill should attempt to describe itself as "the Post Office" or even "a post office" and thereby mislead the public into believing that they are the Post Office&#151;the successor to 340 years of trading by the current Post Office and its predecessors.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para39"></a>Although the words prohibited by subsection (1) of Section 87 are the same as in previous legislation, they do not cover the situation that has never existed during all the centuries about which I have spoken. There were no other universal service providers apart from the General Post Office. But now there may very well be.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para40"></a> This amendment is intended to ensure that whatever happens to any new commercial universal providers or licensees, nobody will be able to confuse it with the new plc, the successor to a long line of public corporations.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para41"></a>Several times during the course of this Bill in the earlier stages I talked about a level playing field and the need to ensure that others coming into this market-place have the opportunity of it being a level playing field and talking about competition. But the fact remains that the Post Office is the Post Office; and I think in this particular regard it needs to ensure that it is the only body that can use that name.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para42"></a>Throughout the entire world there is only one post office per country. Whatever any new competitor may choose to call itself, and any of its public offices, there is and can be only one Post Office.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para43"></a>Amendment No. 81 creates three new offences in addition to those contained in subsection (4). I have to say in passing that the scale of penalty contained in the current subsection (5) is derisory considering the vast amounts of money involved and the size of businesses that may be committing the offences. Offences under Clause 84 carry penalties at level 5. Perhaps the Minister will tell us the reason for the distinction so that we can consider that before the next stage of the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1784"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1784</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para44"></a>The three new offences are separate and distinct. The first prohibits the use of the words "Royal Mail" and/or the Royal Cypher without the consent of Her Majesty. It will be recalled that in the White Paper from which I have just quoted it was necessary for Her Majesty to give her express consent for the present Post Office corporation when it was created in 1969 to continue to use the words and devices. She has just graciously agreed that the privileges shall be granted to the new plc. I am certain that the Minister will tell us that the prohibition is unnecessary because it is already not lawful, for some reason or other, to do so. I do not need to say that "I suspect" the noble Lord will tell me that although I always hope that by using that phrase it might persuade the Minister to reply using a word other than "unnecessary".
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para45"></a>However, when we realise that overseas corporations may be involved in the provision of postal services, and when we see recent events of Internet piracy, I do not think that it is unreasonable to spell out a specific offence in relation to postal services without a potential offender having to scour the statute books to find out that his actions may be unlawful. Whether or not it is necessary, spelling out a specific offence can do no harm.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para46"></a>The second offence involves the prohibition of any universal postal provider other than the new Post Office plc issuing postage stamps. The White Paper says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A depiction of [Her Majesty's] head should continue to appear on all stamps issued by the Royal Mail".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-08_para47"></a>
I am sure that I shall be accused of being unduly suspicious, but I want the Bill to make it clear that no one except the new plc, the successor to the Royal Mail, will issue any postage stamps. Collecting postage stamps has been a world-wide hobby, I imagine from close to 6th June 1840 when the first adhesive stamps were issued. It is now a considerable source of funds to post offices, and hence governments around the world issue large numbers of stamps to collectors. Those are stamps for which the post office concerned never has to deliver a service because the expensive slips of paper are forever put away in albums.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para48"></a>However, more and more, national post offices are taking advantage of this source of funds by issuing new commemorative stamps to celebrate events of often considerable inconsequence; or on themes such as flowers, animals and so on. Some countries derive a large part of their national income from these issues. Our own Post Office is not immune from this practice, or that of changing colours at frequent intervals. All of that is bad enough, but it is by now a well established method of raising funds.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para49"></a>The subsection prevents any universal provider, other than the Post Office corporation from issuing postage stamps to collect its fees in advance. It will debase British stamps out of all recognition and turn us, philatelically speaking, into&#151;it is a slight exaggeration&#151;another banana republic.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para50"></a> There is another even more important reason. On 1st July 1878 what is now known as the Universal Postal Union was established by treaty. It provides for <P>


<a name="column_1785"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1785</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a uniform framework of rules and procedures for the exchange of international mails. This includes a basic consideration such as which post office has what share of the stamp paid for in which country. There is no need for me to go into details of a complex commercial arrangement. It is sufficient to say that the arrangement is between the official post offices&#151;that is, the agencies&#151;of sovereign states. It does not include courier services. I do not say that in any derogatory sense because there are world-class services whose efficiency matches some national post offices, and may be better. I cannot imagine what the post office of, let us say, Albania might want to do when faced with an envelope franked by an ordinary commercial concern.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para51"></a>That brings me to the final offence created by the amendment. The monarch's effigy currently appears on every postage stamp and will continue to do so after the passing of the Bill. This country is unique throughout the world as being the country which invented the postage stamp. The name of the country does not appear on our stamps. The monarch's effigy is the sole indication that this country is the country of origin. Are we to lose that privilege because some commercial company decides to issue its own stamps? Alternatively, is the monarch's effigy to go on as a kind of royal endorsement to what, after all, will be nothing but an advertisement for a commercial concern?
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para52"></a>I have taken some time on the amendments because I believe that despite the Government's foresight, on which I congratulate them, in discussing these matters with Her Majesty, there is a serious omission in the Bill in the Government's failure to deal with what are practical aspects of the Government's plan drastically to re-organise a major and vital public service.
<P>

<a name="00615-08_para53"></a>I believe that these amendments do no more than strengthen the Bill and help produce greater clarity, close potential loopholes and help to secure objectives which I believe both sides of the Chamber desire to achieve for the new post office. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   I feel utterly ashamed not to have proposed the amendments myself. The Minister must accept them!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I have a more limited goal in not using the word "unnecessary" in my reply.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para0"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for her interesting historical digression. When I sat on the Post Office committee of review in 1978 I was sent by a friend a list of all the previous Post Office inquiries which even at that stage stretched back over the centuries. I learned then that whenever one talks about the Post Office one is in a long tradition of discussion on these issues. I also learned that the issue of stamps is extremely important to many people in this country.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para1"></a>I fully understand the desire of the noble Baroness to protect the certain words, marks and effigies used by the Post Office, in particular in relation to the Crown. The Government considered, in consultation with the <P>


<a name="column_1786"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1786</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Post Office, whether it was necessary to provide specific protection in the Bill and concluded that it was not.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para2"></a>The Government reached this conclusion on the grounds that the Post Office advised that it was content that its name was broadly protected as a trade mark. Similarly, the words "Royal Mail" are a registered trade mark of the Post Office. The Lord Chamberlain's Office advised that the Crown and Royal Cypher are protected under Section 99 of the Trade Marks Act; and the Queen's effigy, as it appears on stamps and, indeed, on coins, is protected by Crown copyright. We do not, therefore, believe that it is necessary to include the offence relating to the use of the words "Post Office" and "Royal Mail" or the Crown, Royal Cypher or the Queen's effigy in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para3"></a>With regard to the proposed offence relating to the issuing of adhesive postage stamps, label for payment or prepayment for any postal services, the Government do not believe that these are appropriate. We believe that it is unlikely that other postal operators would wish to issue stamps or other methods of prepayment but if they so wished we would not want to inhibit competition by interfering in their commercial decision to do so. The noble Baroness has spoken constantly throughout these debates about competition and level playing fields. Those principles, with which we agree, should be applied here as well.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para4"></a>If another postal operator were to issue stamps as a method of pre-payment for its own services these would, of course, need to be distinguished from the Post Office's stamps, or those of any other operator. This would clearly be in everyone's interest. It would be at the Queen's discretion as to whether such operators could use her image.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para5"></a>As far as concerns the Universal Postal Union, the stamps of other postal operators would not be recognised for the purposes of the UPU unless and until negotiation had been completed for such recognition. Changes around the world in postal markets will inevitably have repercussions for the UPU versus generally recognised postal services provided by a single postal authority in each country. If the concern of the noble Baroness is about the possible forgery or passing off by one operator of its stamps as that of another, this, of course, would be subject to various criminal offences in the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. As regards the penalties, these would be level 3 which is, I think, &#163;1,000. I think that, given the range of offences under this particular clause, that is not unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para6"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be prepared to withdraw her amendment.

These amendments make provision for postal and money orders issued or handled by the Post Office company. They translate into the Bill the provisions that presently apply to the postal and money orders in the Post Office Acts of 1953 and 1969. The Government believe that it is appropriate to include these provisions in the Bill. There have been provisions in law covering these orders for over 100 years.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para17"></a>While the use of these orders has declined in recent years, postal orders in particular remain an important method of payment by post for members of the public who do not have bank accounts. The amendments protect the Post Office company and bankers by limiting liability in certain circumstances. They allow the Post Office company to make schemes in relation to postal and money orders, make provisions for the recoupment of losses and money orders wrongly paid to bankers and set out the treatment of special money orders issued by the Post Office company under an arrangement with a foreign government or postal administration.
<P>

<a name="00615-09_para18"></a>A number of minor amendments to the Bill are necessary as a result of the insertion of the postal and money order clauses. These amendments&#151;Nos. 121, 124, 145, 127 and 147&#151; deal with matters such as adding new expressions to the list of expressions in the Bill and adding the new clauses to the provision on the commencement.

<br>
(2) In subsection (1) "relevant ship or aircraft" means any ship or aircraft which carries on regular communications between two places in the United Kingdom, one of which is not readily accessible by road.

It also provides for an appeal mechanism where the remuneration for providing such a service cannot be agreed. The clause proposed updates the provisions in the Act of 1953 so that they apply to universal service providers and apply only in those areas where such provision is still thought to be justified, that is, where ships and aircraft are operating to places not readily accessible by road. On some air and sea routes there may be a single provider.

<a name="00615-10_para22"></a> The noble Baroness said: I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 together. Clause 101 gives the Secretary of State the power to ensure compliance with the Postal Services Directive of the EU. The directive is another interference with what should be an entirely domestic matter: namely, an independent state's postal service.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para23"></a>International postal services have, almost since the invention of the postage stamp, been controlled by international agreements between individual post offices forming the Universal Postal Union, an organisation whose existence in Britain has been promoted several times by the issue of commemorative stamps dedicated to it. However, we now have to live with the directive. This group of amendments is designed to ensure compliance with our obligations under the directive.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para24"></a>Amendment No. 91 alters "may" to "shall", and this is to remove a sort of double-whammy in subsection (2). This refers to provisions that the Secretary of State,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-10_para25"></a>
Once the Secretary of State has made the decision that the directive is not being complied with, clearly he is under a duty to ensure that it is. That is why we say that he "shall", not "may", make an order. If he does not want to make an order then he should not make the decision in the first place that the directive is not being complied with or that a particular course of action is appropriate to remedy a breach.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para26"></a>Amendment No. 92 is designed to correct a piece of overkill in the Bill. As provided at present, an order made under subsection (2) by the Secretary of State applies to,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any postal operator or operators".

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1791</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
 I repeat, "any postal operator", and not merely one working within the licensed area. A postal operator is rather unhelpfully defined in Clause 117(1) as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person who provides postal services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-10_para28"></a>
So what are postal services? The same subsection means,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the conveying of postal packets from one place to another by post",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-10_para29"></a>
and the incidental services of receiving and delivering such packets. To complete the circle, a postal packet means a letter, parcel, packet or other article that is transmissible by post.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para30"></a>The ability to provide postal services is not limited to those licensed under Clause 6. Under Clause 7 there are exceptions: 18 of them, including the two all-important ones where the cost or the weight is outside the limits provided for in Clause 7(1). The other 16 are of varying importance or relevance to this amendment. Clearly, personal delivery by the sender is not a postal service. However, some of the 16, and certainly those not requiring a licence because they are outside the price or weight limits, are nevertheless postal services.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para31"></a> With that long preamble, I should like to explain that our object is to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot make orders which are outside the licensed area, even if the unlicensed person is legitimately running what is a postal service within the convoluted and circumlocutory definition contained in this Bill. I believe that this is an intrusion and an attempt by the state to control businesses which, by definition, are falling outside this Bill. The amendment restricts the power to make an order simply to universal service providers. I beg to move.

<A NAME="00615-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Clause 101 provides a power for the Secretary of State to ensure compliance with the EU postal services directive. The purpose of this power is to ensure that the Government can always meet their obligations in particular in the event that the reserved area is removed and with it the ability to impose the universal service obligation and related requirements through licensed conditions.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para32"></a>It is, as I hope is well understood, an emergency power and not a power on which the provision of a universal postal service is intended to rely. The Government place an enormous weight on the value of the universal service obligation. It is the primary duty of the commission to ensure that it is delivered as set out in Clause 3. The intention is that it will do so through the licensing regime, in particular by imposing as a condition of licence on one or more operators a requirement to provide a universal service or part of such a service. It is also intended that the requirements on universal service providers, such as quality of service standards, regulatory accounts, complaints and compensation schemes, will all be imposed and enforced through the licensing regime; and the Bill is built on this foundation.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para33"></a>One reason why Clause 101 contains a power and not a duty to make an order is that the power can either be used in conjunction with the licensing scheme or <P>


<a name="column_1792"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1792</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when it has been suspended. If a licensing regime has been suspended there would be two options available to the Secretary of State to try to ensure that the community obligation is fulfilled. The first would be to use the Clause 101 power. The second would be to remove the suspension of the licensing regime.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para34"></a>Perhaps I could refer to that point again, because it is absolutely central to the argument. One of the reasons why Clause 101 contains a power and not a duty to make an order is that the power can either be used in conjunction with the licensing scheme or when it has been suspended. If the licensing regime has been suspended there are then two options available to the Secretary of State to try to ensure that the community obligation is fulfilled. The first would be to use the Clause 101 power; the second would be to remove the suspension of the licensing regime. The effect of this amendment would be that as soon as the conditions in Clause 101 were met the Secretary of State would be forced to use the Clause 101 power, without having the alternative option of seeing whether the removal of the suspension of the licensing regime would have the desired effect.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para35"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 92 would be to provide that an order requiring a postal operator to provide a specified postal service to ensure compliance with the postal services directive is limited in scope only to those operators who are already designated as universal service providers or, if not, are licensed postal operators. This would have the effect of fettering the discretion of the Secretary of State in respect of which postal operators might be required to provide such postal service as might be required by an order under Clause 101. It would not allow the Secretary of State to decide on the basis of the facts at the time which postal operator or operators should be required to provide the necessary postal services to ensure that the United Kingdom continues to meet its EU obligations and the public continue to benefit from a universal postal service.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para36"></a> Instead, the Secretary of State's discretion would be fettered by a decision taken now against a background and a market which are unlikely to be relevant in years to come.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para37"></a>Ideally, of course, the Government will never need to use these powers. If they were to be used, the expectation must be that a requirement under subsection (3)(b) for a postal operator to provide specified services will, if at all possible, be placed upon an existing universal service provider. But we cannot rule out entirely the possibility that there might be circumstances where the universal service provider cannot, for whatever reason, be relied upon to continue to provide the universal postal service&#151;for example, through insolvency&#151;and where the Government would have to look elsewhere to ensure the provision of such services.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para38"></a>The proposed amendment would provide as an alternative a licensed special operator who is not also a universal service provider. But this alternative is flawed. It is possible that the order-making power under Clause 101 would be used after a licensed area <P>


<a name="column_1793"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1793</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has been suspended. With no licensed area, there would be no licensed operators on whom to place any requirement to provide postal services. Even if the powers were to be used while there was still a licensing regime in place, we cannot be certain either that there would be any licensees at the time, or that those who held licences&#151;which might be for very small niches within the reserved area&#151;were capable of delivering a universal postal service.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para39"></a>The amendment might work in the near future, where we have at least some idea of what this fast-changing market might look like. We cannot know whether it would work in 10 or more years' time, when the market and the players within it may have changed beyond recognition.
<P>

<a name="00615-10_para40"></a>This amendment would unnecessarily restrict the scope of the order-making power, with the effect that, in some circumstances, the Government could no longer guarantee the universal postal service or that other obligations under the directive are met. This would be extremely unfortunate, given the huge value that everyone places on the universal postal service. We cannot afford to put that in jeopardy. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<a name="00615-11_para0"></a>I have listened very carefully to what the noble Lord said. There is no way that I would wish to put in jeopardy the universal service provision. I shall take the matter away and consider it carefully. I think that at this stage I probably accept what the Minister said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("(f) require a universal service provider to keep separate accounts of each of the postal services which may not be provided unless he is a licence holder under Part II and any other postal services, and that the accounts for any other postal services clearly distinguish between services which are part of a universal postal service and which are not,

(g) prohibit cross-subsidies by a universal service provider between the postal services which may not be provided unless he is a licence holder under Part II and any other postal services which are not part of a universal postal service").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-11_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: I consider Amendment No. 93 to be very important. The purpose of the amendment is to give the opportunity for the Secretary of State to impose an obligation for all licensees who require a universal service provider to provide transparent accounts and to prohibit cross-subsidies. I beg the Committee's pardon. It is for the Post Office; not for the licensees. I read my notes wrongly.
<P>


<a name="column_1794"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1794</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para5"></a>The White Paper emphasised the importance of transparent accounting and limiting cross-subsidies to a level necessary for the preservation of essential services. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Regulator will need to ensure that the necessary accounting transparency is in place to give credible assurance that there is no cross-subsidy from the business units operating in the monopoly area to those competing in other market sectors".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-11_para6"></a><P>

<a name="00615-11_para7"></a>The point was expanded later&#151;I abbreviate slightly&#151;where it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Regulator will ensure that . . . any . . . body licensed . . . to operate a full public postal service . . . does not act in any way anti-competitively".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-11_para8"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In particular the regulator will ensure that any cross-subsidy from the monopoly area to competitive activities is the minimum required...to ensure the continued provision of services required by the universal service obligation [USO] and the uniform public tariff".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-11_para9"></a><P>

<a name="00615-11_para10"></a>The White Paper made clear that until the regulator was established the responsibility for ensuring transparent accounting and monitoring cross-subsidies rested with the Government. The 12th report of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry reached a similar conclusion. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There has for some years been understandable resentment among the Post Office's commercial competitors in the parcels business at the way in which Parcelforce has been kept afloat by loans from the Post Office".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-11_para11"></a><P>

<a name="00615-11_para12"></a>A no less important matter for consideration is the fact that transparency and limitation of cross-subsidies is also a central theme of the European postal services directive. Recital 28 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"separate accounts for the different reserved and non-reserved services are necessary...to ensure that cross-subsidies...do not adversely affect the competitive conditions in [the non-reserved area]".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-11_para13"></a>
 Article 14 of the directive contains an express requirement to keep separate accounts and to allocate costs to each of the reserved and non-reserved services.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para14"></a>The amendment will ensure that the Bill gives appropriate weight to the directive, to the select committee report, and, in particular, to the Government's stated policy as set out in the White Paper&#151;all of which require that competition should be fair and that cross-subsidies should only be permitted where they are necessary to maintain the universal postal service obligation.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para15"></a>The Minister for Competitiveness told the committee in the other place that the Government had "considerable sympathy" with the aims of a similar amendment tabled by my honourable friends. He said that he believed that the Bill already made provision to achieve these aims and suggested that the Companies Act 1989 and various pieces of legislation prohibiting anti-competitive practices achieved the desired effect.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para16"></a>The short answer is that the amendment seeks to enhance the provisions in the Bill and in the other legislation. One could describe it as "belt and braces". The amendment makes clear in a single place&#151;without anyone having to hunt through the statute book&#151;what is required to comply with this important topic.
<P>


<a name="column_1795"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1795</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para17"></a>To anticipate another possible objection, I hope that the Minister will not suggest that the objective of the amendment will be met by conditions in the licence. Subject to what already appears in the Bill, and what may later be included by amendments that we intend to bring forward, the regulator has a discretion as to the contents of the licence. Indeed, there is no requirement that every licence should be identical.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para18"></a>It is true that under Clause 101(2) the Secretary of State can intervene if he is dissatisfied with the arrangements, but the Government are seeking only permissive powers. It cannot be right that the Government's obligations to comply with the directive&#151;and, indeed, with their own stated policy in the White Paper&#151;as well as with the will of Parliament, as expressed in the select committee report, should be put into effect at the discretion of the regulator. It should be in the Bill. It has been said several times that they want transparency and no cross-subsidy, and that should be in the Bill. It is fundamental. Creating competition for the Post Office, but ensuring that that competition is fair and complies with our Community obligations, is fundamental. That is why I began by saying that this is a very important amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para19"></a>The amendment ensures transparency; I hope that the Minister will be able to meet me on it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-11_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendments. These amendments cut to the heart of the Bill. Throughout the discussions at Second Reading and during two days in Committee, a great deal has centred on the ability to generate fair competition for the Post Office, for the universal service provider, but to ensure that no competitive edge is gained by the provision of the universal service than would otherwise be the case.
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para20"></a>In order to give the regulatory authorities the information they require to ensure that this happens, my noble friend has hit upon extraordinarily powerful arguments for insisting that these basic provisions should be put on the face of the Bill. They would be in line with our European obligations. It is extraordinarily important to include such a provision on the face of the Bill in order to achieve the comfort required by bodies that might be competitors of the universal service provider in the non-reserved areas. I support the position adopted by my noble friend.

<A NAME="00615-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I must say again that there is no substantial difference between the noble Baroness and myself on this matter. We too believe that there should be transparency and that any movement in the accounts should be clear to anyone involved. The amendment seeks to ensure two things: first, that the universal service provider keeps transparent regulatory accounts; secondly, that anti-competitive cross-subsidies from the reserve to the non-reserved areas are prohibited. They are exactly the aims with which the Government have sympathy. The regulatory framework established by provisions within the Bill already provides for both.
<P>


<a name="column_1796"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1796</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para21"></a>The amendment would have no practical effect unless and until the order-making powers in Clause 101 were used. Given that these powers are intended to be used only in very limited circumstances&#151;in effect they are emergency powers and not ones on which the provision of universal postal services are intended to rely&#151;it is unlikely that they will be triggered in the near future, if ever. Unless the noble Baroness wishes only to ensure regulatory accounts and prevent undue cross-subsidy at some as yet unknown point in future, this amendment will achieve nothing. (I seek to avoid using words which are regarded as provocative.)
<P>

<a name="00615-11_para22"></a>This amendment is not appropriate in respect of the order-making power itself. The two issues highlighted in the amendment are already subsumed within the general powers of Clause 86(2). That clause provides that the Secretary of State may by order make such provision as he considers appropriate to ensure that the obligation is complied with. We have already made provision for the concerns that lie behind the amendment. To ensure that there is a level playing field and the Post Office company does not abuse its dominant position, or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner, including illegal cross-subsidy from reserved to competitive services, under the Bill we are establishing&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I apologise for interrupting the Minister. I believe that the noble Lord said that under Clause 86(2) the Secretary of State could make absolutely certain that there was transparency. I do not find that provision in the clause. It may be that the noble Lord has referred to the wrong provision.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I believe that under Clause 86 the Secretary of State has general power to make such provision as he thinks is appropriate. I shall check it in case I have given the wrong reference.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para0"></a>It is anticipated that the Post Office will be granted a licence that will take effect from, in this case, the first day of the new licensing regime. Such a licence would be agreed between the Post Office company and the postal services commission. I stress that it would have to include provisions that satisfied the detailed requirements of the EU postal services directive. It may be that this is where a difference of opinion arises. There is a statutory duty to follow the EU directive which requires that that information is produced.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para1"></a>I am informed that the correct reference is Clause 101(2).
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para2"></a> A draft outline licence for the Post Office was placed in the Library of the House on Friday 11th February 2000. This document illustrates the kind of terms and conditions that the Government expect to see in the Post Office company's licence. One such condition (at paragraph 9 on page 4 of the outline licence), as required by the EU directive, is that the Post Office company keeps separate accounts within its internal accounting system for each of the activities carried out within the reserved area on the one hand and its activities outside the reserved area on the other. Furthermore, accounts for the non-reserved area must <P>


<a name="column_1797"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1797</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distinguish between activities that are part of the universal service and those which are not. That will enable the commission to ensure that there is no undue cross-subsidy from monopoly to competitive markets.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para3"></a>It is also intended that it shall be a condition of the Post Office company's licence that it competes within the law and does not abuse its dominant position, enter into anti-competitive agreements or use anti-competitive means either to enter new markets or to consolidate its position within existing markets. The Post Office company will also, like any other postal operator, licensed or not, be subject to general competition rules. The proposed licence covers this area. If there is any concern about this matter among other postal operators, there is in any event a requirement for this to be done under the EU directive.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para4"></a>Finally, if one is to make a further provision of this kind&#151;which I believe the Committee agrees is unnecessary in the circumstances&#151;this is not the way to do it, because the provision will come into effect only by way of an emergency power. Therefore, the amendment is not appropriate and I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I have great difficulty in accepting the response of the Minister. I made the point very strongly that this fell within the EU directive and that the Bill should comply with it. I also said that it was in the White Paper and that the 12th report of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry had come to the same conclusion. All I say is that it should also be in the Bill. I very much hoped that the Minister would not say that it was for the regulator to put it into the licence. Perhaps at Report stage we may make suggestions as to what should go into the licence. However, at this stage what goes into the licence is within the discretion of the regulator.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para5"></a>I would have been satisfied had the Minister been able to show me a reference in the Bill to the transparency of accounts. The Minister corrected an earlier mistake, which I understand; it is always difficult to find the right references. The Minister quoted Clause 101(2) which provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order make such provision as he considers appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-12_para6"></a>
and so on. In Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 I sought to change "may" to "shall". I did not succeed because the Minister regarded it as unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para7"></a>Therefore, the Secretary of State may not in the event need to do anything, and the regulator may not put it in the licence. The White Paper and European directive say that it should be, and the Minister relies on that. The fact remains that it is still not in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I hope I have made it clear that all of this is covered by the EU directive, which also requires the national regulator to make certain that the universal service provider meets the requirements of the directive. This is not a matter that is within the discretion of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has power to require it, and the EU <P>


<a name="column_1798"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1798</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>directive means that he has no choice. In any event, we have already shown it in the licence. This is not a matter of choice; it is a requirement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I would be very grateful if the Minister could give me the relevant reference in the EU directive. If the Minister is correct I am amazed that I am being lobbied so much by competitors who come into the market and tell me that there has never been any transparency in this matter and there is no provision that there should be. They do not believe that the directive covers it. If the directive dealt with it there would be no need for the amendment, in which case I would be in agreement with the Minister. The Minister began by saying that there was very little difference between us. If that is correct&#151;I doubt whether this matter is covered because I am being pressurised by people who want to ensure that there is transparency&#151;what is the difficulty in accepting this amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I do not have to hand the exact reference in the European directive, and perhaps I may write to the noble Baroness and provide it. Clearly, this is a fundamental point. I do not want any misunderstanding among other postal operators: this is how we shall proceed, because there is no choice in the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I believe that a note has just come from the Box.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I am now able to give the reference with even greater speed. Articles 14 and 22 make provision exactly for this point. Therefore, I hope that that answers the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-12_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I must say to the Minister that he was saved by the bell. I had intended to divide on this point and had mentioned the fact to my Chief Whip. I had hoped that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, would ask the Liberal Democrats to support me on this matter because, as he claimed earlier, it was he who pointed out during discussion on Amendment No. 69 that there should be clear transparency vis &#224; vis acquisitions by the Post Office. He claimed the credit for that today, and I was intending to claim the credit on this point. As I took on board what he said and moved the amendment, I hoped that he would also support me and ask the Liberal Democrats to do so.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para8"></a>A few hours ago we lost a Division because the Liberal Democrats did not vote with us. That made the difference between winning and losing. It would have been nice if they had supported me on the matter of transparency, which I believed was very dear to their hearts. Therefore, I believe that not only the Minister but the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, was saved by the bell as now he does not have to advise his colleagues one way or the other whether to support or go against transparency.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para9"></a>I make it absolutely clear to the Minister that I shall ensure that those who urged me down this course take note of the particular conditions in the European <P>

<a name="00615-12_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 94, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 95, 96, 98, 99, 100 and 102. My noble friend Lady Byford will speak to Amendment No. 97, to which my name and that of my noble friend Lord Northbrook have been added.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para15"></a>My amendments are probing amendments because the Government were not able to give an explanation to the other place of some of the provisions of this clause. Perhaps that is understandable to the extent that this clause, which covers the important&#151;indeed, fundamental&#151;subject of subsidies to the Post Office to enable it to continue to provide vital social services to many small communities, was introduced in the other place only at the last minute at Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para16"></a>That was despite the fact that throughout the entire passage of the Bill and, indeed, during the debate on the White Paper which preceded it, honourable Members on all sides in the other place expressed serious concern about the effects that the Bill would have both on the universal postal service and on communities which experienced transport problems, lack of banking facilities or where the only shop (the village store), also serving as the post office, depended on that custom for its viability. It is not only village stores that will be affected but also small local shops in suburban parades which must compete with nearby giant supermarkets and often can do so only because customers come in to collect their pensions, and so on.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para17"></a>The so-called new Clause 1, which is now Clause 102, shows every sign of having been cobbled together hastily, partially to placate the other place where objections were raised to the absence of subsidy provisions. Certainly the aim also is to try to head off objections from your Lordships, who undoubtedly will not be willing to be fobbed off with provisions which may truly be described as an "Emmental cheese" because it is so full of holes.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para18"></a>At Second Reading, I expressed concerns about a number of mysterious provisions in the clause. No answer came from the Minister then and no answer has come since. Since Second Reading, no amendments have been tabled by the Government to clarify matters. Therefore, we must assume that the Government are content with the meaningless provisions that the clause contains, as drafted at present. I believe that that simply will not do for this very important provision. Absolute clarity is required. The public and sub-postmasters, whose businesses otherwise may be wantonly destroyed by the <P>


<a name="column_1800"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1800</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government's action in taking away their earnings from paying pensions and social security allowances, must clearly know at least the basis of the help that the Government will give, or suggest that they may give, by way of compensating subsidies.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para19"></a>The clause as drawn at present is simply full of holes. Even at this advanced stage, we do not know whether the subsidy will be permanent or temporary, what will trigger the payments, how much they will be, or whether they will be more or less than the Treasury is trying to save by taking away, on their own figures, &#163;400 million a year from the income of all the post offices by phasing out payments of benefits from across their counters. We do not even know whether all post offices will qualify and, if not, which will do so. We do not know who will be the arbiter of who will receive what, how much they will receive and how they will receive it.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para20"></a>We would prefer the whole clause and the need for subsidies to be unnecessary. However, they are necessary because the Government have decided to press ahead with the scheme for automatic credit transfer, whether or not the public want it and whether or not they have access to cash facilities. If the Government are to put at risk people's investments and businesses, valued in total at &#163;2 billion, or at the least deprive local communities of a vital facility, then compensation is required and, in this case, it is in the form of a subsidy. We do not want to see people's businesses in effect confiscated by the state, which wants to grab &#163;400 million a year. That is not the way that things are done; certainly that is not the way that things should be done.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para21"></a>With that explanatory preamble, perhaps I may now go through the amendments in sequence in order to indicate to the Minister where we require both clarification and, indeed, some sort of commitment from the Government. We want to know what it means and what is to happen.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para22"></a>Amendment No. 94 alters the word "may" to "shall". If the subsidy provisions are purely permissive, the entire clause is a meaningless piece of window-dressing. After the Bill is passed, that may be the last that anyone hears or sees of those subsidies. I say that particularly in the light of proposed subsection (6), which gives the Treasury an absolute veto over the whole scheme. The reason for my later amendment, Amendment No. 101, to this clause is to delete that veto.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para23"></a>Amendment No. 95 provides that one of the purposes of the subsidy is to have regard to the social needs of the local post offices and to ensure that those needs are given priority over commercial considerations. We do not want to hear that a village post office is not to be provided with a subsidy because it is not profitable. I remind the Committee that there is ample precedent in the form of subsidies paid to train and, more especially, bus services on otherwise unprofitable routes. If a sub-post office should turn out to be unprofitable and is to be ruined completely, then the subsidy is called for.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para24"></a>Amendments Nos. 96 and 98 are simply paving amendments for Amendment No. 99. That amendment adds a new paragraph, (5)(a), and <P>


<a name="column_1801"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1801</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prohibits the payment of the subsidy to a bank or building society. If we are to have subsidies to save sub-post offices, they should be the only organisations that receive those subsidies. Part of the problem is caused by the withdrawal of banking and cash facilities from small localities by banks and building societies.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para25"></a>A potential problem is also caused by the same commercial concerns demanding the payment of fees or charges from pensioners or receivers of benefits who collect their own money. It would be iniquitous if money which was needed to facilitate the continued existence of a sub-post office were diverted to the giant banks. It cannot be right for the Government to take &#163;400 million a year from small businesses in the form of sub-post offices and hand that over to the banks. The subsidies are intended for the benefit of sub-post offices and this amendment is to ensure that that is where the subsidy goes.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para26"></a>Amendment No. 100 adds another new subsection. Subsection (2) refers to:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the person deciding whether to make the payments"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-12_para27"></a>
that is the subsidy. Subsection (3) refers to payments:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"made by the Secretary of State or by another person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-12_para28"></a>
It is not clear whether that other person is the same one as referred to in subsection (2) or yet another person.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para29"></a>In subsection (5)(b) there is reference to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the person concerned".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-12_para30"></a>
 Who is that? What is this vague clause taking about? Who are these people? More important, despite the fact that several noble Lords asked the Minister who was this person&#151;whether it is one person or two people&#151;during Second Reading, there was no answer from him. I wonder why the Government are being so coy about specifying who is this mysterious person. Is it one person, two people, three people or even four people? I asked that at Second Reading and we still do not know.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para31"></a>Until the Government clarify the position to your Lordships' satisfaction, we believe that there should be certain essential constraints. We believe that the payment of subsidies must remain in the hands of the Government. However, if they want power to delegate such decisions so that they can divert any criticism of the application of subsidies from their good selves, that should go to the commission. At least the commission can be regarded as non-political and impartial.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para32"></a>Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this new subsection expressly exclude from the power to distribute the subsidy to local authorities members of local authorities or candidates for local government and trade associations and trade unions. So long as the Government have failed to describe the circumstances under which a subsidy will be paid and by whom, it is essential that there should be payment only when it is impossible for it to be of local political advantage or for the benefit of a pressure group.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para33"></a>At Second Reading I mentioned that, and I said that no one should think that I am unduly suspicious or see politics lurking behind every single amendment that is <P>


<a name="column_1802"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1802</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tabled. The fact remains that if the subsidy is to be handed to a local council to pay to any sub-post office in their area where they believe that a subsidy is required, I would bet that it would be given to a Labour council just before a local election. I am sure that noble Lords opposite will understand why I feel that that should never be allowed to happen. In any case, that should not happen. It is not a matter for local councils. If there is a need for this subsidy, the Government must have responsibility for it and take the flak in relation to handing it out and when deciding the rules.
<P>

<a name="00615-12_para34"></a>The Government have had ample time to clarify all the mysteries surrounding this clause and to ensure that when they promise a subsidy it is one that they or the Treasury cannot weasel out of as soon as the ink is dry on the Bill, the Bill is passed and there are no longer hundreds of thousands of sub-post offices collecting names and handing them in at Downing Street or somewhere else. The subsidy clause came in rather quickly. Now it is all over and matters have gone quiet. We do not want to hear that the Bill is simply passed. I await the Government's response to our anxieties over this clause, which we believe is essential to preserve the entire system of local sub-post offices. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I rise to support the case put forward by my noble friend Lady Miller. I am not sure how the Minister will respond&#151;whether he will be coy or whether the Government still do not know. I apologise to your Lordships that I shall take some time over this item because the crux of the matter is how people claim and receive benefits. I have been through this exercise on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill and I still have no answers. I believe that the Government do not know the answer. I hope noble Lords will understand why I shall take my time to go through this yet again.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para0"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to establish a method of payment and the practicalities for people who live either in rural areas or in urban areas. I want to try to flush out how people will receive payment, what the cost will be and when and how this will happen.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para1"></a>Perhaps I can begin at the beginning. In this country some 2 million people are still "unbanked". When I raised this matter on 16th May during the debate on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, commented that she was not happy that I used the term "switch card" and that they may well come forward with a bank card. In a letter she stated that the precise means of doing so will be a matter for the Post Office and banks and that they expect available options to include withdrawing money through a bank card. That is a start.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para2"></a>My question to the Minister&#151;there will be several&#151;is, if that is so and we move to a bank card system, how will that differ from what the previous Government had started and which this Government abandoned? How will it save money, if it is being reinstalled? Who will pay for the new bank card? Will it be cheaper than <P>


<a name="column_1803"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1803</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the previous system? Will the Department of Social Security be expected to pick up the bill, or will the Post Office pick it up?
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para3"></a>We know that there are some 2 million people who are "unbanked". The Government have indicated that they will finance a scheme to give them banking facilities. If that is so, how will the Government do that? What do the Government believe will be the cost and who will bear it? Will it be the Department of Social Security or the Post Office? If the banks have to bear it, the potential cost to them of opening and operating such social bank accounts is an interesting point. Whether or not we expect them to make a profit from such accounts, there would be a loss.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para4"></a>I have received letters from banks and it has been agreed by them that an average balance of around &#163;1,000 a year will be needed to make any bank account profitable. Many of these accounts will not contain that sort of amount. We certainly need to have some indication from the Government as to how and who will cost the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para5"></a>I believe that the Minister will say that the Government still do not know. We have been waiting for the PIU report that was supposed to be with us at Easter. Easter has come and gone, May has come and gone and we are half way through June and the report is still not with us. I am told that there are great matters in the report, but I and many other noble Lords are anxious that if we are not careful, not only this Bill, but also the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill will pass through the House without us having answers to these basic questions. It is extremely important that we have answers.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para6"></a>On top of that, today I received the CAB social policy bulletin for June 2000. The Skipton CAB has carried out research which showed that its clients were experiencing real difficulty in gaining access to bank accounts, and were anxious about ATM usage, particularly in rural areas. The bulletin said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A survey of all banks and building societies in the Craven District area aimed to find out what facilities were on offer and what checks were made before a bank account could be opened. Few of the 21 banks and building society branches surveyed seemed to be able or willing to offer any facility to clients experiencing financial problems or who had a default recorded".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para7"></a>
If that is true, and if the banks are not keen to give people banking "streams" without back-up, who will?
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para8"></a>The Alliance & Leicester Bank has also written to me as, I believe, I mentioned at Second Reading. That bank is concerned about the impact of withdrawing the current system of the Giro. The Select Committee report on the Rural White Paper, dated 3rd May 2000, stated on page 18 that the committee feared that the loss implications of withdrawing the current benefit payment system would result in some more losses of post offices, particularly rural post offices.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para9"></a>I believe that banks are entitled to refuse banking services to certain clients; a point I made when I referred to the letter from the CAB. However, the Government wish to see universal coverage. If the Government forbid banks to charge "unbanked" people for using banking facilities, who will pay for it?

<a name="00615-13_para10"></a>Having referred to the PIU, I shall now move on to the speech made recently by the Prime Minister at the Women's Institute meeting. I am sure that it is a fact now well known to noble Lords that that speech was received with a certain coolness. However, it contained a very important section. The Prime Minister stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You have a strong campaign on rural post offices".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para11"></a>
That is indeed the case.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "I want you to preserve them too. This month we publish plans that will allow people to carry on taking out pensions and benefits in cash; and that will protect rural Post Offices and offer them a new lease of life. Be under no illusion: over the years more people will choose to have their money paid into their bank accounts all around the world, postal services are going to be revolutionised by new technology and the growth of the internet. So we can give rural post offices a future."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para12"></a>
He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would fail in my duty to you, if I don't also say it has to be a future allied to future reality".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para13"></a><P>

<a name="00615-13_para14"></a>I do not think that anyone would deny that. I should hate it if Members of this House thought that I was someone with a negative view, one who felt that things should remain as they are. However, changing from one system to another without knowing what the new system will be and what it will cost is important and needs to be thought through.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para15"></a>We spoke of this problem during our deliberations on another Bill. We were told then that the ACT transactions to be introduced will cost only 1p per transaction, as compared with order books, which cost 48p. It has also been stated that benefit payments made using ACT will reduce fraud. I shall probably not argue about that because I have no reason to suspect that that would not be so. However, I suggest that the Government's comparative exercise as regards ACT has not given a true result, or at least not a full one. The figure of 1p per transaction quoted by the Department of Social Security is what it will need to pay rather than a calculation of the full cost, whereas the cost of the order book reflects the full costs involved.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para16"></a>Research carried out by the banks estimates that it will cost &#163;350 million a year to establish and run a social banking system that will pay all benefits into bank accounts. That is a very different figure from that of 1p which is being bandied about so freely and is the reason why I keep posing such questions. For a successful introduction of ACT, the Government need to be realistic about the actual costs involved.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para17"></a>I should like to raise one or two other points. Each week 20 million benefit claims are made at post offices. Over the course of a year, those claims attract some &#163;50 billion in cash payments, distributed via 712 million transactions. As I have said, research carried out by the banks has shown that the establishment of ACT will cost &#163;350 million, while the Government continue to quote 1p per transaction. If an additional &#163;50 billion in cash is to be paid out via the banking system to benefit claimants, then in addition to the 1p cost per electronic transfer from the Benefits Agency to a claimant's bank account, surely other costs will arise; namely, the cost of physically moving &#163;50 billion in cash to millions of bank accounts and to post <P>


<a name="column_1805"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1805</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>offices. Furthermore, the cost of setting up new bank accounts for claimants must be taken into account, as well as the cost of running bank accounts to be used for paying benefits. For example, a cost is incurred every time a plastic card is used at an ATM.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para18"></a>I apologise that I have had to speak at length. However, noble Lords will understand my concerns in this area. If rural post offices and some of our more remote urban and suburban post offices do not survive, the reason for their demise will be because of the withdrawal of the payment of benefits via sub-post offices. Given that, the Government's wish to ensure that each recipient will still be able to visit a post office will need to be looked at in a different light.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para19"></a>I have posed several questions in my contribution. First, I do not believe that we have received a full answer as regards the full cost of implementation. It may be that the Minister will tell me that it is still too early to tell. Secondly&#151;this point was also raised by my noble friend Lady Miller&#151;we must address the question of the subsidy. The amendment was introduced only during the later stages of the Bill's progress through another place. It has been suggested that some of the proposed subsidies could be paid through local authorities. However, I understand that sub postmasters are concerned about that for the simple reason that one local authority may take a quite different view from another. From a practical point of view, I should like the Minister to comment on this. It is not a good idea to implement all kinds of different systems when the aim is to achieve universal coverage.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para20"></a>On the last occasion that we discussed the matter of ensuring that payments reach claimants, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said that he was happy with the assurances given by the Minister. However, those assurances will be valid only if claimants retain access to a post office. If I have over-egged the pudding here, I apologise. This matter is posing a dilemma for those who need to examine the hard reality of how claimants are to receive their payments. I raised these matters during our debates on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill and I have raised them again today. That is because it appears that the buck is passing between two departments. It is now time for the Minister to clarify one or two of these very important points.

I am grateful to those sitting opposite for having put down these amendments. They have given the Committee an opportunity to examine the whole question of subsidies.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para21"></a>It is common knowledge that the idea of providing subsidies came only as a late add-on during the deliberations in another place because the plans for the transfer of benefit payments to ACTs were ill judged. Those plans had not been thought through and the subsidies were introduced as a reaction to that.
<P>


<a name="column_1806"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1806</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para22"></a>Perhaps I may say at the beginning of my remarks that I do not believe that subsidies will provide the answer to the long-term future of sub-post offices and post office counters in either urban or rural areas. The salvation of the counter network will come through the provision of more business, better competitiveness that will attract new business and a climate that will enable those small businesses to stand on their own feet. We must recognise that the proposals for subsidies have been introduced to compensate for the loss of payments that would accrue from the transfer of cash payments to automatic credit transfers.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para23"></a>The Government's intention to enable the possible use of subsidies was first indicated only as late as February of this year. The Secretary of State for Industry stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government will consider very closely the need to include a provision that would enable a subsidy to be provided where it is appropriate to do so".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 15/2/00; col. 805.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para24"></a>
That statement in itself begs a number of questions.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para25"></a>Like many others, I had expected that an amendment would be introduced during the Committee stage in another place, but no amendment was forthcoming. Instead, on 12th April the Secretary of State announced that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we will table a new clause to the Postal Services Bill when it is debated on Report. It will enable me to set up a financial scheme to ensure that essential services can still be delivered through a nationwide network of local post offices".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/4/00; col. 385.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para26"></a><P>

<a name="00615-13_para27"></a>Clause 102 has now been introduced. The clause does not make it clear how subsidies are to operate and when they will be considered necessary. If we must have subsidies, then the most straightforward method of providing them would be through direct payments from the central government, authorised by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para28"></a>Clause 102 enables the Secretary of State to make such payments to assist in the provision of post offices and the services provided as he sees fit. These payments can also be restricted to post offices of a "particular description". I am most anxious to know what the criteria of a "particular description" would be. It seems likely that the Government will have to consider any criterion for access to postal services that is recommended by the PIU.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para29"></a>However, both previous speakers mentioned that we have been waiting with bated breath for the report of the PIU which was promised when this matter first came before this Chamber. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, drew attention to the fact that we are still waiting. Perhaps we shall get another rabbit out of the hat, as happened in the other place when the whole question of subsidies was revealed. But if we have had to wait all this time just to see what the future of the counter network will be, it is a poor performance by the Performance and Innovation Unit. We expect the report to talk about the social and environmental guidance emanating from this Bill relating to the number, or percentage, of people living within an area to be served by a post office, otherwise, I see no clear indication regarding what will happen.
<P>


<a name="column_1807"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1807</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para30"></a>We talk about local authorities, but there is already a precedent for local authorities to become involved. Section 97 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 quite clearly states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a local authority consider that it would be for the benefit of the whole of any part of their area ... the authority may undertake to pay ... [an] operator any loss he may sustain by reason of the provision or continued provision of those facilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-13_para31"></a>
It is unlikely that most local councils will be able to find the funds to do so. In fact, as a former local councillor I find it offensive for central government to pass over the responsibility to put something right that it created in the first place&#151;namely, taking away the cash payment, thereby making it necessary to find the money to subsidise the post offices&#151;and then say to local government, "You have to do it". That seems to me to be incomprehensible, if not less than straightforward.
<P>

<a name="00615-13_para32"></a>I should like to say much more but both previous speakers covered a whole range of issues about sub-post offices. I completely agree that we should not be paying subsidies to banks or building societies, which are actually putting extra pressure on the whole system. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will be able to give us some answers, as well as an indication of where we are going on this question of subsidies. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, subsidies are not the answer: more business in our post offices is. The future of the network would be much more secure if the Post Office were allowed to get on and promote its business.

<A NAME="00615-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I do not envy the Minister because, of course, the cat is out of the bag as far as concerns the delay in the publication of the PIU report. As my noble friend Lady Byford made clear, at the annual conference of the Women's Institute last week the Prime Minister certainly gave the impression not only that the report and an accompanying announcement would be made later this month but also that he would make the announcement himself. That rather queers the pitch, if I may so describe it, of the Minister at this moment.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para0"></a>None the less, the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, and by my noble friends Lady Byford and Lady Miller are absolutely right. Before the end of the proceedings on this Bill, we all need to be satisfied, wherever we sit in the House, that the Government have come forward with the right answer in Clause 102. We also need to know how the wretched system will work.

<A NAME="00615-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Not for the first time in this House, or in the other place, the important issue of whether financial systems can be provided for the support of public post offices is under discussion. Clause 102 is an extremely important clause. It will enable the Secretary of State to set up a financial scheme for the purpose of supporting public post offices. As the Secretary of State said in another place on 12th April, this power is a safeguard which is intended to keep open the option of financial assistance.

<P>

<a name="00615-14_para1"></a>Perhaps I may stress again that this is an enabling clause; it is not a scheme. Therefore, to ask that all the details should be laid out now is to miss the point. In such a piece of legislation it is sensible to include the power. But that is not the same as saying that a scheme will be brought in tomorrow to cover the provisions in the clause.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para2"></a>I should like to deal, first, with the whole question of the loss of income from post offices by the switch to ACT, which will take place between 2003 and 2005. It will not happen tomorrow. Therefore, it may prove to be necessary to take such action in the future; it may not be right to take it now. That is why we have introduced this enabling clause and not a scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para3"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, that long-term subsidies are not the answer. However, we must try to ensure that the Post Office company will be able to develop alternative revenue streams. That is why we are equipping 40,000 counter positions in 18,500 post offices with computer equipment to modernise the network at a cost of almost &#163;500 million. This will give the Post Office the ability to offer an improved service and a wider range of services. For example, we have already seen more banks seeking to offer services through post offices.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para4"></a>Perhaps I may also deal with an issue that has frequently arisen in this Chamber; namely, how benefits will be paid in the future. Again, this will take place in the year 2003, not tomorrow. I believe that we have made it absolutely clear that people on benefits will be able to receive them in cash from post offices without any additional payments. That situation is clear. With the systems that we are putting in place, it is not difficult to imagine many ways of how that could be done.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para5"></a>If you believe in the future of the Post Office, as I do, you cannot continue to argue the case that the current system of payment, which is totally antiquated, should be the way forward. It is not surprising&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but I do not believe that any of us has made that suggestion today. To be honest, I do not think that anyone said that we wished the current system to continue. I just wanted to put the record straight. I am sure that the Minister was about to deal with it, but what we want to know is the actual cost involved. We have received no real answer in that respect. We are told that it will cost one penny, but I do not believe that that is the full truth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Some noble Lords have implied throughout this debate that there is a choice as regards not going ahead with the new system and that we could somehow retain the current one. Some people seem to believe that that is a sensible way forward. However, if we believe in the future of a Post Office as a modern system providing a service to customers, we should ensure that such systems are properly automated in line with other computer-based systems that exist today. It should not surprise anyone that such systems are likely to be cheaper than the current systems, which are essentially paper based. <P>


<a name="column_1809"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1809</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The calculations available show &#163;500 million in savings in reduced administrative costs, compared to paper-based systems, before taking into account the &#163;140 million savings through reduced instances of fraud and theft of order books and giros.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para6"></a>Without having checked all those figures myself, I have to say that I do not find that at all surprising. In this modern age when every other kind of business is going over to this kind of system and saving large sums of money, I do not think that it is right to go on arguing for the retention of an old system. Similarly, I do not think it right to continue to raise concerns by implying that we cannot issue cash through this method just as we do through any other system.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para7"></a>I hope that I have not misunderstood the noble Baroness, but she asked how we would get cash to post offices for this purpose. But that is exactly what we have to do today. I cannot see that there is a difference in having to get cash to the post office, compared with the other systems. Post offices have always had to use large amounts of cash to make benefit payments, and this is not generated by their own system.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para8"></a>However, the Government recognise the real concerns of many people throughout the country about continued local access to postal services, particularly in rural areas, but also, and importantly, in some of our inner cities. The clause provides an additional safeguard allowing the Secretary of State to provide financial assistance if it proves necessary to do so. That clearly underlines the Government's commitment to a nationwide network of post offices.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para9"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 94. We have made it quite clear that the clause as it stands will enable the Secretary of State to make a scheme to support public post offices. Again, as we have repeatedly made clear, this will enable financial assistance to be given if necessary. The noble Baroness's amendment assumes that a subsidy is needed. I do not share her pessimism about the current situation, although we should be prepared for the future. We are giving the Post Office the commercial freedom that it needs. We are modernising and creating opportunities. The Government are committed to ensuring that post offices are equipped and redesigned to face the future and are thereby able to continue to play their role as an essential part of the country's fabric.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para10"></a>As I have said, the Government's aim was to provide an enabling power for the Secretary of State to make a scheme. If financial assistance proves necessary, then as a matter of fact, commercial considerations are likely to take second place, particularly if it is a particular service which is to be subsidised. A service can be subsidised under the clause only if the person making the payments considers that the provision of the service through post offices assists in the provision of the post offices themselves. It may well be the case that without the subsidy the service concerned would not otherwise be provided on a commercial basis through post offices or indeed other outlets within the vicinity.
<P>


<a name="column_1810"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1810</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para11"></a> However, commercial considerations will be important, since one of the ways in which we shall determine the level of assistance needed is to look at the cost at which the service could be provided on a commercial basis. I fear that the noble Baroness's amendment amounts to an invitation to write a blank cheque now for a scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para12"></a>As I have said, we value post offices greatly and have taken steps to support the network. If a scheme is necessary, it will be because certain wider public policies cannot be delivered by commercial means alone.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para13"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para14"></a>I appreciate the strength of feeling in the Committee and more widely about the recent wave of withdrawals of bank branches from small communities. However, I do not believe that the noble Baroness's amendment on this point is the correct reaction.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para15"></a>Clause 102 provides for payment for services that support public post offices. This may involve asking commercial bodies to do something that is inherently uncommercial for them, and the Government may wish to provide assistance for that purpose. More specifically, an amendment such as we have before us might prevent payments to the Post Office company itself, since it is planning a universal bank which will play a potentially important role in combating social exclusion. There are many other businesses that may have banking connections, and we would not want to rule them out either.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para16"></a>Similarly, it might be sensible to ask a financial institution to have a hand in running a scheme, although it would be the Government's general intent to appoint a government agency or similar body to act as the "person" deciding to make payments. In such circumstances, it might be reasonable to pay fees in respect of work done by a bank or building society.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para17"></a>Therefore, while I accept the intentions behind the amendment, I must ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para18"></a>Similarly, I would hope that Amendment No. 97, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, will be withdrawn. My principal difficulty with it is that it is based on the supposition that there will be a single scheme for the provision of financial assistance to public post offices. In fact, there may be a number of schemes targeted at certain types of post office. For example, the Post Office presently has around six types of contract with different classes of sub-postmaster, and we might want schemes that were tailored to those arrangements. We might want to offer different support in rural areas from that in inner cities, or have special schemes aimed at delivering certain other services through post offices.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para19"></a>That is not to underestimate the importance of benefit payment to post offices or the wider concerns about the network. As I have said repeatedly, the Government are committed to the national network of post offices.
<P>


<a name="column_1811"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1811</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para20"></a>The amendment would unnecessarily fetter the discretion within the Bill. Any scheme will have to come before Parliament for approval by affirmative resolution, and there will therefore be plenty of opportunity to comment on the merits or demerits of a specific scheme. I would therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para21"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 100, which would appear to constrain the scheme before the Secretary of State even has a chance to present one for the approval of the House of Lords. The Opposition have tried to suggest that without these controls the scheme could be used for political purposes, with greater assistance being given to areas with strong Labour representation. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State assured another place, there is no suggestion whatever that this would happen or should happen. The Government's only interest is to enable a scheme to be put forward for the support of public post offices.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para22"></a>As I have said, any scheme will require the approval of both Houses. There is no question of the Secretary of State being able to sneak through an unsuitable scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para23"></a>We want to ensure that a suitable body would provide the assistance. I turn now to that issue. It could be the commission, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, suggested, but it might be more economical and make more sense for a body with experience of administering this type of scheme, such as the Countryside Agency, to do so. Clearly, it will depend on the type of scheme that is needed.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para24"></a>Against that background, I find it rather extraordinary that delivery through local authorities would be ruled out, even if that were the most suitable means. Furthermore, local authorities are already involved in giving financial assistance to post offices through a scheme which, although enhanced and made more generous by the present government, was instituted by the previous administration. I am, of course, referring to the village shop rate relief scheme, which provides a sole general trade store and/or post office in a settlement of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants with 50 per cent mandatory rate relief. Local authorities also have discretionary powers to top up that relief to 100 per cent. They also have the discretionary power to grant up to 100 per cent relief to any other rural business in the settlement which is important to the community.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para25"></a>If the amendment was designed to probe the Government's intentions, I can assure the Committee that we would want to deliver any scheme in the most targeted way possible. That might involve a national body, since, after all, we are talking about a national network. However, I would not rule out regional or local bodies assisting in the administration of a particular scheme or schemes.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para26"></a>With regard to this amendment, I end on a technical point. The amendment suggests that any person who administers a scheme should be appointed by the commission. It is our intention that the person to administer the scheme should be named in an order <P>


<a name="column_1812"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1812</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>placed before Parliament, and therefore approved by the House of Lords and another place. If we were to follow the amendment, that oversight would appear to be removed from Parliament and delegated to the commission.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para27"></a>I should like briefly to touch on some of the other points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, although I have tried to deal with them generally in terms of the question of cost. We inherited a scheme, the benefit payment card, from the previous government's plans. That was a magnetic strip card, an integral part of the Horizon project, which was running three years behind schedule and hugely over budget. We have put the project back on track by removing the outdated technology and complexity of the benefit payment card. ACT is an established, convenient and fraud-resistant method of payment, and all post offices will be equipped with the Horizon platform by this time next year. In that way we can significantly improve the cost structure of what the post offices are doing.
<P>

<a name="00615-14_para28"></a>I hope that that broadly deals with the issue of concern to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, as to how the system will work and whether the costs can be reduced in the way suggested. The main point on which this Committee must deliberate is that this is an enabling power and that the parameters laid down constrain it in an appropriate way. Any scheme will have to come back to the House for affirmative resolution. At this point we are not putting forward any specific scheme; this is simply an enabling clause. On that basis the amendments are not appropriate and I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<A NAME="00615-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I know that the Minister is too experienced to take it personally when I say to him that his response was totally unsatisfactory. He said that he did not want subsidies; that we should have more confidence in the Post Office; that it will prosper and will not need subsidies. But there should be no suggestion that his noble friend Lord Clarke, my noble friend Lady Byford or myself welcome the idea of subsidies; we do not. If the Government were not introducing ACT at this time, there would be no need whatever for these amendments. So none of us welcomes the idea of subsidies.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para0"></a>However, we said that if there was a power to introduce a subsidy, then that power should not be so full of holes that it has no value whatever. Why did the Government feel it necessary to introduce the new clause at Third Reading in the other place, which subsequently became Clause 102? Why was it not in the original Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I rise simply to make the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said that no one on the other side of the Chamber was suggesting that ACT should not be brought in. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is saying that the <P>


<a name="column_1813"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1813</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government should not have brought in ACT; that that is the cause of these difficulties. That is a fundamental mistake and there is no alternative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I believe that the introduction of ACT at the critical time of the changeover of the Post Office to a plc with one shareholder and so forth, causes great difficulties for the sub-post offices. The sub-postmasters have made that known in their petitions, in their meetings, and in their lobbying briefs which Members of the Committee on all sides of the Chamber have received.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para1"></a>My question is: why did the Government feel it necessary to introduce this permissive clause at such a late stage? Why was it not part of the original Bill? I suggest that the reason the Government came up with this clause is that the sub-postmasters decided that ACT was extraordinarily dangerous for their businesses and that there needed to be a subsidy of some kind. The clause is a response to the petition in Westminster Hall and to all the lobbying that took place.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para2"></a>But does that response mean anything? Clearly not. The Minister began by saying that it was an enabling power. In fact, once the Bill is passed, I suggest that we shall hear no more about this clause. The Minister said that the Government had had no thoughts about a subsidy; that they did not intend to introduce one; and that the enabling power exists in case the need for a subsidy should ever arise. But once the Bill is passed, it is passed. The clause can sit there and never ever be used.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para3"></a> We feel that that situation is totally unacceptable. My noble friend Lady Byford spoke extremely well to her amendment. The general feeling is that we need some sort of clarification. The Minister was unable to identify "the person" in the clause. Is it one person, two persons, any person, that person or this person? I know not. The fact that the provision is so vague that the Government know not either, nor agree with us that the "person" should in fact be the Crown, leads me to the conclusion that this power will never be used.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para4"></a>Let us hope that the power is not necessary. However, if such a clause has to be included in the Bill, it should mean something. This clause means nothing. While the Minister spoke so well and we heard Members of the Committee on his side call out "Hear, hear!", I hope that he will not be upset when I say that his response was totally unsatisfactory. I could use other words to describe what I think. I felt that what he said was not worth saying. It meant nothing.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para5"></a>It may be that our amendments are not as perfect as they should be. That is possible. I cannot pretend that my amendments are always right. I hope they are, but it may be that they are not. However, it would have been helpful if the Minister had said that something could be done. We could then take his words away and think about them. But there is nothing to be done. This clause has been inserted into this Bill purely to placate the sub-postmasters and mistresses who fear that they will lose their businesses, otherwise it would have formed part of the original Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>was. What the Minister picked up on was the fact that I was trying clearly to identify the cost of the scheme. There has been no answer at all to that.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para17"></a> Perhaps I may make one or two further points. Like my noble friend, I was somewhat concerned&#151;I am happy it is recorded&#151;that Members of the Committee opposite found it funny that we pursued this matter to the depths that we have. I suggest that some of them, especially the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, have been valiant in trying to put forward the practical reasons for chasing this matter. There is no point in having a wonderful Post Office, which can do so many things, if the one thing it needs to do, but cannot, is enable people to draw their money from its many branches. I shall not repeat my arguments.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para18"></a>I hate to say it, but I accept that some post offices closed during our time in government. However, the increase in closures has been frightening this past year. Those noble Lords who jest about it need to look at the figures; I gather that there were about 500 this past year.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para19"></a>Those people who run sub-post offices do not do so for the good of their health; they are small individual businesspeople. The Government are supposed to be joined-up thinkers and are supposed to be for individual and small businesses. They are not helping small businesses. Indecision is really the reason for the amendment. My noble friend touched on that.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para20"></a>I went to the rally at the Central Methodist Hall, which was packed. Earlier that morning some of those attending had delivered what was considered to be the biggest petition (3,125,000 plus signatures) relating to the concern being expressed by people with regard to sub-post offices, those who run them and those who actually use them. That is no jesting matter. That is actually very serious.
<P>

<a name="00615-15_para21"></a>I shall not press the noble Lord further. I had hoped that he would have given better answers to my questions. As I said earlier, I am not against moving forward and neither are the people who run the sub-post offices. However, they run small businesses; they need to plan for the future. They do not look to subsidy, but perhaps because of what the Government are doing they will need some form of subsidy. We return to where we started; that is, waiting for a report which has been in gestation for longer than I think noble Lords would wish. I should be glad of a response to my remarks before deciding what to do with my amendment, Amendment No. 97.

<A NAME="00615-16_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I apologise to the Committee and particularly to the Chief Whip. I am speaking to the amendment, which I have moved. With hindsight, I apologise. I am 10 minutes too late in what I should have done.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para0"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my question. In response to the earlier debate, he indicated that it might not be the Post Office which organises welfare benefit payments, but that it might be the commission or the Countryside Agency. Could the Minister tell me whether there have been any contact or negotiations with that agency? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   There are two issues involved. One is the subsidy issue. I hope I have made clear that, if we have a subsidy scheme, it has not been decided who it would be. Therefore, there have been no discussions with the various bodies. As there are alternative bodies, it might not be sensible at this point to say that it would be done through the commission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-16_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. Could I ask him why he particularly mentioned the Countryside Agency?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I was simply trying to illustrate the kind of body which might be considered in these circumstances, given their experience. That is not the same as saying, "We have had discussions". It simply illustrates that at this stage there are a range of bodies, and the Countryside Agency is one of them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-16_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. I clearly do not want to take up any more of the Committee's time. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, for his contribution to our discussions. It does not remove my commitment to what I believe is causing many people great concern. I shall look at Hansard very carefully. I hope that, in the meantime, the Government&#151;if not the Minister, perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;will provide more answers to our questions before the next stage. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-16_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a short probing amendment. I hope that the Minister is able to give me some information because it is a very important matter. Its purpose is to elicit from the Government a clear commitment that when applying any Customs legislation the Customs and Excise will provide a level playing field among postal operators, either providers of a universal postal service or licensees. There has to be a guarantee that competition will not be distorted, either accidentally, or deliberately by selectively imposing controls and regulations on certain operators or certain classes of operators.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para12"></a>No VAT is paid on postage by the sender of mail. VAT is paid by the courier services on their charges for domestic and EU movements, although international movements are free of VAT. I am not advocating the charging of VAT on postage, or the reduction of VAT levied on the courier companies, even if any of them become licensees or universal postal service providers. That is something that they have hitherto had to contend with and have none the less been able to compete with the Post Office. However, there is what the industry itself describes without exaggeration as a potential disaster looming in the United Kingdom parcel industry.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para13"></a>With effect from July&#151;just over a year away from now&#151;Customs and Excise intend to introduce a new electronic export system, which will completely change how parcel operators will be required to work. At present, they are using a paper-based system. Shipments are keyed into a computer and shipping manifests are then printed out. These printed manifests are presented to Customs at the export airport. Customs scan the manifests, select anything that they want to examine, and allow the rest to go on their way. Then within 14 days the shipping company has to provide a detailed schedule for all shipments valued at more than &#163;600.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para14"></a>The drastic change that Customs are proposing is that all shipments will have to be declared pre-shipment to the Government's computer. There is also a proposal for the declaration to include an eight-digit tariff code. That is not to be mandatory&#151;at least, not for the moment&#151;but Customs and Excise have said that without it the clearance of shipments may be delayed to allow for manual scrutiny of the data. Therefore, in order to obtain quick clearance&#151;or, putting it another way, to avoid the delay of shipments&#151;highly skilled staff will be required to select the correct code for each item out of thousands of possible codes and to import them on to the forms. I should tell the Minister that I was faxed such a form and believe that it would be a nightmare to deal with it all properly.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para15"></a>It involves every item that is being exported. The encoding will in any case delay dispatch and mean that very late pick-up from customers will become impractical, resulting in a much poorer service. In addition, a message will have to be sent for every shipment when the goods arrive at the airport, followed by a later one when the goods have gone on. And, as though that is not enough, a full declaration has to follow, with details of high-value shipments.
<P>


<a name="column_1819"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1819</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para16"></a>The industry claims that this massive increase in red tape will be catastrophic, first, on the ground of cost. Each declaration will cost approximately 20p per item. That is because, in order to comply with the demands of Customs and Excise, carriers will need to create an export brokerage department to make the entries and to include the tariff codes. Secondly, no shipments will be able to move from warehouse to airport, or from airport onwards, until positive clearance has been received from the Customs computer. Keying in that information will take a considerable amount of time, thus delaying all the traffic and necessitating an earlier pick-up.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para17"></a> The four major operators in this field estimate that to implement and operate the new system will cost them no less than &#163;5 million a year. And that is without counting the cost of lost business if the carriers have to pick up earlier in the day and the delay while all the data is entered on to the computers.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para18"></a>The industry provides a vital service in the form of guaranteed deliveries of time-sensitive material&#151;for example, material dispatched from the United Kingdom to reach destinations in the USA the next morning by the start of their working day. The point is that this procedure, with all the risks of delay, does not now and will not in the future apply to the Post Office or to Parcelforce. In other words, the Bill, which is to create competition, will be anti-competitive in this area.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para19"></a>The dice are being deliberately loaded against the independent operators. The excess cost and delay will inevitably fall on our exporters to the detriment of the economy. Furthermore, some of the smaller operators will have to go out of business because of the cost, the problem of recruiting skilled staff and the disproportionate management burden that the new system will impose upon them.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para20"></a> It is difficult to see to what end the requirement is directed, except to enable Customs and Excise to claim that they have modernised&#151;and that seems to be an in-word. During our debates on the Bill we have spoken of competition and I know that Members of the Committee will accept that we have done our best to protect the Post Office in those areas in which it should be protected. The previous amendment showed that most clearly. However, the other side of the coin is to make it competitive for other operators to come in, and to benefit the Post Office, too, so that they can compete with postal companies across the world. But with obligations on one side and not on the other, that is difficult.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para21"></a>I cannot see that the provision would produce an extra penny in revenue or detect one extra restricted export. Customs and Excise have recently stated that under the new system there will be no more examinations than under the current system of spot checks. Customs and Excise will continue to depend on what the dispatching company tells them its customers have told it. The fact is that at the moment the Post Office enjoys exemption from these declarations, or a more favourable regime in relation to them. And it will continue to do so. It is being given <P>


<a name="column_1820"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an unfair advantage; that is, a reduction in costs and the possibility of avoiding delay which the present independent operators will have to put up with.
<P>

<a name="00615-16_para22"></a>The amendment, which I have described as probing, requires a specific answer to the specific problems that I have outlined. I and the industry, which is vital to our export trade, await to hear what the Government will do to prevent it being severely harmed for no other purpose, it would seem, than to facilitate the administrative procedures of the Customs and Excise. Perhaps the Minister will explain that and why the requirement should not apply to everyone or to no one. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, has made a powerful case which needs an answer. I naturally prick up my ears when I hear the phrase "distortion of competition" and there appears to be a legitimate concern. However, because both the noble Baroness and I are so keen to hear the answer, I shall not stand further in the way of the Committee hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   Customs have no wish to impose undue financial or administrative burdens on anyone or distort competition. However, it must be recognised that the nature of the business and the type of traffic of a particular postal operator in the future may be very different from traditional postal traffic as currently handled by the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. For example, a good proportion of international postal packages are gifts between family members where delivery is not usually time critical. There is a big difference between this and regular commercial traffic paying a premium rate for speedy delivery.
<P>

<a name="00615-17_para0"></a>Operators might well be upset if Customs decided to treat the two types of traffic in exactly the same way. Customs must have the freedom to vary the arrangements to meet the needs of the traffic and to deal with the different risks posed.
<P>

<a name="00615-17_para1"></a>This is an international issue. A study by the World Customs Organisation, the Universal Postal Union and the International Express Carriers Conference is currently being undertaken to compare the procedures for postal and express carrier traffic. We need to await the outcome of that study.
<P>

<a name="00615-17_para2"></a>Furthermore, it is not at all clear that there is unfair treatment and that a competitive advantage is being given to the Post Office. Express parcel operators have a major advantage in terms of speed of clearance. Their packages are cleared automatically unless Customs decide to examine particular items. Customs clearance is nearly always achieved within one hour. At postal depots dealing with Post Office mail, clearance of chargeable packages normally takes several hours and can take up to two or three days.
<P>

<a name="00615-17_para3"></a>However, the subject is one of importance and we would not want to be unfair. Perhaps, therefore, I may take these detailed points away, discuss them with the Customs and Excise and write to the noble Baroness as soon as possible.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   I cannot give a time. The work is being undertaken, but I was not suggesting that it would provide the answer. I was saying merely that it is an international problem and that there are differences between the two classes of business. For that reason, I believe that we should treat them differently. Whether the treatment given was fair was the issue I took away from the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and it is that about which I shall speak to Customs and Excise: as to whether the current system appears to be fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-17_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, for his support of my amendment, and the support of my noble friend, requiring an answer from the review which is taking place. I am grateful for the answer and am satisfied that the noble Lord will take it up with Customs and Excise to find out why this is happening. It is to be hoped that that will resolve the problem.

<a name="00615-18_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES</B></center><br>

<br>
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) special money orders are orders for the payment of money in the United Kingdom which are issued by the Post Office company in pursuance of an arrangement made with a government or postal administration of any other country or territory for the transmission, by means of orders for the payment of money, of sums of money through post offices under the charge of the Post Office company and the postal administration of the other country or territory.
<br>
(3) The reference in section (Schemes in relation to postal and money orders)(2)(b) to money orders shall be construed as including a reference to orders for the payment of money issued in pursuance of an arrangement of the kind mentioned in subsection (2) above by the postal administration of the other country or territory.").

<A NAME="00615-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville </B>   moved Amendment No. 114:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 110, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-18_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>RECORDS OF THE FORMER POSTMASTER GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT</B></center><br>
(".&#151;(1) The Secretary of State may by order vest in the Post Office company such records of the department of the Postmaster General as&#151;
<br>
(a) belong to Her Majesty in right of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and
<br>
(b) are specified in or described by the order.
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State may give such directions to the Post Office company as he considers appropriate for ensuring that any records so transferred to the Post Office company are available to the Crown for inspection and copying.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-18_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 114, I speak also to Amendment No. 129. The new clause will recreate a power similar to that in Section 75(2) of the Post Office Act 1969 to enable the Secretary of State by order to vest in the Post Office company the property in the pre-1969 records of the Postmaster General and to give directions to the Post Office company in respect of making those records available to the Crown for inspection and copying. The order-making power in Section 75(2) of the 1969 Act has never been exercised, and so the vesting of the pre-1969 records remains an outstanding matter from the 1969 Act. As the Secretary of State would wish to consult before exercising such power, its provision is being carried forward in the Bill in order to preserve the Government's current position under the existing legislation.

Since the Minister is going to write to me, rather than waste time today, perhaps he will reply to this point in the same letter.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para11"></a>The point in question is that Section 6(4) of the Post Office Act 1969, which is repealed by Schedule 9, authorises Schedule 1 to the 1969 Act.

As I speak my noble friend is in the Moses Room. He is capable of many things, as we know, but being in two places at once is not one of them. I think that it has been understood that we shall adjourn for pleasure for 10 minutes, until 7.25, so that the business in the Moses Room can be completed. We shall then continue with business in the Chamber. I beg to move that the House do adjourn during pleasure.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para39"></a>The Government are introducing free television licences for people aged 75 years or over from 1st November 2000 to help a section of the community, many of whom depend on television as their main source of information and entertainment. Older pensioners are more likely to be in poor health or socially isolated. They are also more likely to be on low incomes.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para40"></a>This initiative will free over 3 million households from the need to budget for their television licence fee, currently &#163;104 for a colour television licence.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para41"></a>The process for claiming a free licence is not, and cannot be, as simple as might at first appear. Many over-75s do not have the necessary documentation to prove entitlement to the concession. The concession is intended to apply to people aged 75 or over for their principal residence. The structure of the scheme needs to incorporate precautions to limit the concession to those for whom it is intended and to safeguard public funds. The arrangement needs to be as simple and as streamlined as possible to minimise administrative costs and to avoid unnecessary burdens on genuine claimants.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para42"></a>The most efficient way to operate this concession is for the Department of Social Security and, in Northern Ireland, the Department for Social Development, to make available to the BBC certain limited information about people who are, or will shortly become, eligible for the concession. The information also needs to be made available to third parties providing services to the BBC in connection with the issue of television licences. This information will be used to set up a database, against which the BBC can check applications for free licences, short-term licences, and refunds on unexpired licences. This Bill is required to authorise the disclosure of such information. Clause 1 will give the Secretary of State&#151;in practice, the Department of Social Security&#151;and, in Northern Ireland, the Department for Social Development, the legal authority to supply information of prescribed kinds to the BBC.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para43"></a>The information that can be provided to the BBC must be prescribed by order. Under Clause 6, any order will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, offering the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of any proposals.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para44"></a>The Government intend to prescribe only a narrow range of information which can be supplied to the BBC; namely, the age, date of birth, address and national insurance number of persons aged 74 or over. An order will also enable the DSS and the Department for Social Development to disclose to the BBC the fact that a person has died.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para45"></a>Clause 6 enables different provision to be made for different cases. This provides for flexibility and precision in the making of orders.

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1830</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para46"></a>We understand concerns about the data protection and privacy implications of disclosing information of this kind to an outside body for purposes other than those for which it was originally obtained. The question of the security of the information is, we believe, fully addressed by the safeguards built into the Bill, to which I shall come shortly.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para47"></a>The Government have considered whether the Bill complies with the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, Article 8 which relates to privacy. Our legal advice is that the disclosure of the kind of information which we propose the DSS should supply to the BBC may not engage a person's rights under Article 8 because such basic information is not an interference in a person's private life for the purposes of the convention. But even if the rights enshrined in Article 8 were affected, we believe that what we propose would be justifiable under Article 8(2) as a proportionate response to a legitimate aim; namely, to set up an efficient but not unduly burdensome system of administration that provides the necessary protection against issuing free licences in response to mistaken or fraudulent applications.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para48"></a>If the BBC had to operate this concession without the information we propose: first, every claimant would have to produce documentary proof of age, in addition to a completed application form, and as we know, many would be unable to do so, and would have to obtain the documentation before they could apply; and secondly, claimants would have to reapply each year, as the BBC would have no other means of knowing they were still alive and at the same or any other address.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para49"></a> Without the proposed information, the concession would also need to be policed more actively. We know from complaints about the existing enforcement arrangements that many people would regard that as unacceptably intrusive. In addition, without this information, the concession would be much more difficult and expensive to administer. We have been informed by the BBC that the concession could not be implemented on 1st November, as proposed, without the proposed information.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para50"></a>Requiring the BBC to clear claims with the DSS and the Department for Social Development has been suggested as a possible solution but is not, in our view, a realistic option. It would still require primary legislation since the verification process itself would entail the disclosure of information. It would involve considerable duplication of effort and cost by the BBC and government departments; and it would delay the processing of claims, by requiring applications to be handled several times over instead of just once.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para51"></a>The Government accept the need to ensure that information of this kind is used only for the purposes for which it has been provided. Under Clause 2, the information may be used only in connection with television licences for which no fee is payable or for reduced-fee licences. The reference to reduced-fee licences provides flexibility in case further concessionary schemes are introduced. The Bill does <P>


<a name="column_1831"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1831</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not allow the BBC to use the information to administer any scheme, existing or new, unless an order is made designating the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para52"></a>Clause 3 of the Bill protects the information supplied to the BBC by creating an offence of disclosing such information without lawful authority. An offence can be committed by any recipient of the information&#151;for example, the BBC or one of its contractors&#151;or anyone who works, or has worked, for such a recipient. The offence extends to companies, including the BBC, to past as well as present employees, and to staff working under other arrangements, such as self-employed people engaged on a consultancy basis.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para53"></a>The maximum penalty, on indictment, is imprisonment for up to two years and an unlimited fine, or both.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para54"></a>Clause 4 of the Bill was introduced by the Government in another place, in response to concerns that the offence of unlawful disclosure, as originally formulated, did not extend to company directors. The Government considered the matter and concluded that it was right to strengthen the protection afforded to sensitive information of this kind and that this could be achieved if there was a possibility of personal criminal liability for directors.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para55"></a> Clause 4 therefore provides that, if an offence by a body corporate is shown to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer, or to be attributable to any neglect on his or her part, that person as well as the company is guilty of the offence and so liable to be prosecuted. This will bring the treatment of company directors, in cases of unlawful disclosure, into line with the provisions of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 in relation to DSS contractors.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para56"></a>This Bill will enable the application procedure for a free television licence to be greatly simplified and will benefit both the over-75s and the taxpayer. TV Licensing will send out details of the concession to all households over the coming months, inviting anyone who is over 75 to apply for the concession. Claimants will simply complete and return the form. Applications will be checked against the information to be provided to the BBC under the provisions of this Bill. It will be possible to issue a free licence on the basis of such an application in most cases, with no further effort on the part of the applicant. Additional information will need to be sought only if there is a discrepancy between the information provided in the application form and that held by the BBC. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME="00615-19_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, I must admit that on this side of the House we are beginning to wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, can do just about anything in this world. We have finally found out that there is one thing he cannot do; that is, to be in two places at one time. Earlier this evening, the House was asked to submit to an <P>


<a name="column_1832"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1832</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>innovative procedure by which the Sitting was suspended for 10 minutes to enable the noble Lord to reach this Chamber from the Moses Room. I am delighted to see him here, but I should be all the more delighted if in future government business was so ordered that it did not put such a strain on him by necessitating his presence in two places at once. However, I have particular reason to be grateful to the Minister to which I shall come in a few moments.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para58"></a>First, I shall respond to the Government's Bill and I shall then explain the reasons why I have sponsored the Private Member's Bill on the Order Paper. The two Bills are being given a concurrent Second Reading this evening for the convenience of the House, although the House may consider that that is less convenient when it appreciates that it will mean that I give a longer speech this evening than I have ever yet given in my three-and-a-half years as a Member of this House. I hasten to add that it will still be shorter than the speeches of many other noble Lords. Two in one does not quite go this evening. But I assure the House that the practice will save time overall and enable the House to debate the Private Member's Bill which covers issues which are closely intertwined with the Government's Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para59"></a>After the debate on the Government's Bill is concluded, I shall then formally move the Second Reading of my Bill but then, with relief, speak no further to it today.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para60"></a>At this stage, I thank the Public Bill Office for working at break-neck speed to write my Bill so that it could be debated today. I thank also the Minister for suggesting this procedure as a possibility and for allowing time for it.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para61"></a>I deal first with the Government's Bill. As the Minister has outlined, it is about the conveyance of information. It gives legality to the plan to allow the BBC to have access to some social security information which is held on every single person throughout the country aged 74 and over. Indeed, the BBC can hold that information on its own database. The Government have decided that that is the system that they want to use to police the concession given to all 75 year-olds so that they may have free TV licences.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para62"></a> In Committee, we shall need to examine how that system will operate to try to make sure that it is as fair and effective as possible. Indeed, the question is whether it is, as the Minister described it this evening, the most efficient system.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para63"></a>Our view is simply that the decision to provide all 75 year-olds with a free TV licence will be welcome to every beneficiary, particularly in the light of the minuscule 75 pence per week increase in the basic state pension which was announced in this year's budget. Of course, we believe that it is laudable to help 75 year-olds but there are better ways of doing it. In another place, my right honourable friend William Hague has outlined the ways in which that should be done. We should leave people with the freedom to make their own choices about how they spend their money provided that they are given a solid, reliable income as their basic pension. There are other times at which it would be right to go into the detail of that.
<P>


<a name="column_1833"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1833</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para64"></a>The reality is that this Bill will pass and will do so at a time when the basic pension has not been greatly improved. The scheme will operate until the next election at least, so we should try to make sure that it operates in as fair a manner as possible.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para65"></a> But the government order passed this March introduced free licences for those who are 75 and over and, in doing so, made the system even more complex and introduced even more anomalies than had previously existed, anomalies which I hope to remove with the terms of my own Bill with which I shall deal shortly.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para66"></a>Clause 1 of the Government's Bill outlines the kind of information which may be disclosed to the BBC. It is important to note that until now, information on the national insurance database has been made available only to national and local government bodies who are concerned with administering benefits, crime prevention and justice. That is a departure from what has happened before. There is concern about privacy and data protection and the implications of disclosure to an outside body of this information, however reputable the body may be, as the BBC is, of course. But that information is held by government departments for social security purposes.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para67"></a>Concern has been expressed, in particular, about the way in which previously protected information may in future be made available not only to the BBC but, as Clause 1(2) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person providing the BBC with services in connection with television licences".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-19_para68"></a>
I listened with great care to what the noble Lord the Minister said tonight in explanation of that.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para69"></a>It is a wide definition. It clearly means that commercial companies will have access to sensitive information. They need it: indeed the noble Lord said that without this information the BBC simply could not act by the 1st November and get the scheme up and running. That in itself is not an argument for the scheme as it is. The date is a political decision by the Government. One should not simply accept a scheme because of the date having been put in as the start of the scheme. The definition is so wide in referring to providing the BBC's services. Anybody can do that: presumably it even includes the post office counter clerk who physically hands over the licence to the 75 year-old who benefits under this scheme.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para70"></a> The amount of information that may be disclosed brings another concern, because at one and the same time the Government say that Clause 2 places strict limits on the purposes for which the BBC and its contractors are able to make use of the information. Then it goes on in Clauses 5 and 6 to extend the reasons why the information should be passed on to the BBC. I believe that we shall need to explore that further in Committee.
<P>


<a name="column_1834"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1834</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para71"></a>Clause 3 sets out several measures which are designed to safeguard the security of information that may be disclosed to the BBC and its contractors. After all, in the wrong hands that information could be used to set up benefit fraud and it is important to control that use of information.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para72"></a>In another place, my honourable friend John Greenway identified a problem that the Government have not yet resolved in this Bill; namely, what should happen if there should be accidental disclosure of information simply because an electronic transfer had reached the wrong destination. On another matter regarding Clauses 3 and 4, I was pleased to see that the Government have amended the Bill in another place with a new Clause 4 which extends the offences to include the liability of directors. However, that clause was only introduced at the last minute on Third Reading. It was therefore not possible for the clause to be given as detailed consideration in another place as it would have received at Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para73"></a>In that debate my right honourable friend Douglas Hogg raised an interesting point with regard to the word "neglect" in Clause 4(b). I believe we shall need to look further at that in Committee.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para74"></a>The Bill is brief but it introduces a scheme which is complex to operate and may be confusing to many people. It represents a significant departure from the existing licensing arrangements and an unprecedented and unique use of social security information. I look forward to more detailed consideration of the Government's Bill at Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para75"></a>Turning to my own Private Member's Bill, which addresses the issue of television licence fees and concessions, I am very much aware that existing licence fee concessions are, by general consent, both unsatisfactory and arbitrary. No party can take any credit at all for improving them. All parties, in some measure, have made the situation more difficult. I am grateful to Abbeyfield and Age Concern&#151;organisations which have great experience of providing accommodation for elderly people&#151;for their helpful briefings on the rules governing concessions, and for highlighting some of the inequities within the system. It was as a result of listening to their expert advice that I was convinced that I should sponsor a Private Member's Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para76"></a>My Bill tries to do two things. First, it attempts to rectify the anomalies introduced this year by the Government and, secondly, to highlight the inequity of other closely related anomalies in the concessions system. The Government's order that went through in March this year raised the cost of the TV licence fee and, at the same time, made two substantive changes to the concession system. First, the television licence fee concession to those in sheltered accommodation was extended so that it would cover all those over 60, instead of discriminating between men and women of pensionable age. Secondly, it provided for free licences for every household in which a person of 75 and over lives.
<P>


<a name="column_1835"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1835</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para77"></a>I will address first the question of the concessions to those in sheltered accommodation. In another place the Minister for Broadcasting, Janet Anderson, stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we have removed one small anomaly in situations in which entitlement to the concession is based on housing provision&#151;namely, in the sheltered housing scheme. Previously, strictly speaking, men over 60 in such a development would have threatened the concession for everyone in that development. We have now said that in future the qualifying age for both men and women in such housing will be 60".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 10/4/00; col.156.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-19_para78"></a><P>

<a name="00615-19_para79"></a>Of course that should have been a most welcome procedure which everyone should have applauded&#151;but not quite. While that was a perfectly truthful statement by the Minister, it is not the whole picture. Indeed the order can in practice remove from those over 60 who are currently in sheltered accommodation the right to concessions in certain narrowly defined circumstances. In other words, they will lose the concession they are already receiving. I accept of course that the Government had absolutely no intention of causing that to happen: I have always made that clear. The changes that were introduced by the Government were intended to make the system more certain and above all, I believe, to save the BBC from being taken to court for exercising their discretion in what some might have said was an incorrect manner. However, I believe that most would have accepted it was in a useful manner.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para80"></a>I was advised by the TV licensing organisation, who are agents of the BBC, that as a result of the Government's order, if a man aged between the magic ages of 60 and 65&#151;in other words between 60 and 64&#151;lives in sheltered accommodation and also works for 15 or more hours a week, the fact that he works for those hours means that he can no longer be regarded as retired. That, in turn, means that the terms of the order disqualify everybody else in that accommodation from holding a concessionary licence. It just wipes out their right. The BBC can no longer exercise a discretion and people who currently get concessions will lose them.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para81"></a>Are there likely to be cases like this? Yes, most certainly. We are talking about sheltered accommodation, where residents may well enter that accommodation before they are no longer able to work but they want the reassurance and benefits of sheltered accommodation for the future. There are indeed several "good practice" employers like B&Q and Sainsbury's Homebase, who actively recruit older workers. It is therefore possible, nay probable, that the scenario I have described could occur. As soon as I was aware of the problem I alerted the noble Lord the Minister. Unfortunately it was only the day before the debate in this House, and subsequently the Government have taken no further action.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para82"></a>Clause 1(3) of my Bill would make sure that in sheltered accommodation of any kind people who are currently entitled to concessionary TV licences will not lose that right should a man aged 60 to 64, who works 15 hours or more a week, come to live in that sheltered accommodation. I should, however, confess here that <P>


<a name="column_1836"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there was a misprint in Clause 1 (3)(a). It should read "1(b)(i), 1(b)(ii)". Mistakes can creep in everywhere it seems!
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para83"></a>The second issue addressed by my Bill is the cost of the TV licence when the television is in a communal room of residential and sheltered accommodation&#151;a TV that is used only by the residents there. I turn first to the situation in sheltered accommodation where there are people aged 75 and above: just that particular group. The Government's introduction of the free TV licence for people who are aged 75 and over with TVs in their own household has highlighted an inequity.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para84"></a>From 1st November this year, if I were aged 75 or over I could have a television licence in my own room in sheltered accommodation, but I cannot have a free TV licence in the common room. It can only be used by me if I am aged 75 or over and everybody else is 75 and over. Are there likely to be such cases? Yes, there are. After all, changes in our life expectancy and quality of life at an advanced age means that in these days it is very common that in sheltered accommodation one finds people who are well over the age of 75. Indeed, Abbeyfield tell me that the average age of residents in their houses is 85.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para85"></a>Abbeyfield is the largest provider of very sheltered accommodation in the voluntary sector. They have around 600 societies in the United Kingdom as whole, managed by about 1,500 volunteers. Almost 600 of the society's houses have residents who are all over the age of 75. That means nearly 9,000 people will be adversely affected in Abbeyfield accommodation alone. In addition, I am told by Methodist Homes that they have about 900 people who will be adversely affected; and Housing 21 will have about 16,000 people affected. That is a minimum, of the people I know about, of some 26,000 who will be adversely affected.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para86"></a>As the law stands now, it is possible to imagine two friends over the age of 75 living next door to one another. One lives in her daughter's house where there are grandchildren, and the other lives next door in an Abbeyfield house. The first friend, the one living in her daughter's house, gets a free TV licence for herself, her daughter, her son-in-law, her children, her grandchildren, her great grandchildren, and all her visitors to come along and watch the television anywhere in the house. The second friend, the one next door in the Abbeyfield house, can have a free TV licence only if she restricts her viewing to the TV in her own room. That really is very odd.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para87"></a>When I tabled a Written Question on this matter, the Government's response was that the change proposed by my Bill would simply introduce yet another anomaly into the system. But at least my anomaly would be for the benefit of the vast majority of people aged 75 and over, whereas the Government's anomaly means that none of them has the benefit.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para88"></a> I appreciate that the situation with regard to common rooms used only by residents raises many anomalies. I have tried to deal with another such anomaly in Clause 1(2), which provides that the TV used in a common room should qualify for a concessionary licence; that would be enjoyed by a <P>


<a name="column_1837"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wider group of people than only those over 75. It seems generally very odd that people who are in residential care can have concessions for TVs in their own rooms, but not in a common room that only they use.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para89"></a>As one always says about Private Members' Bills&#151;one is always right to do so&#151;the wording in my Bill may not be felicitous. That is not due to any fault on the part of the Public Bill Office, but I may not have properly expressed my wishes in the first place. It may be beyond my wit to frame an effective Bill, but I hope that it is not beyond the combined wit of the parliamentary section of the DCMS, Ministers and their advisers to draft a good Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para90"></a>I hope that the Minister will accept the underlying principles of my Bill and agree that the system should be amended where it is humanly possible to make it more fair.

<A NAME="00615-19_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, the proposal to issue free TV licences to those aged 75 and over from 1st November 2000 has, in truth, lost a little of the gilt which surrounded it when it was first announced. One could suggest that most of us are somewhat gullible when little gifts are given by government and are initially grateful for any crumbs from the Treasury table. However, when the munificence of the Treasury towards the elderly of the country was shown up for what it was&#151;namely, a sop to draw attention away from the downright insulting increase of 75p per week on the basic pension, a point referred to by my noble friend&#151;the cynical antennae of many of us were immediately switched on.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para91"></a>This is a shame, in effect, as, first, it does nothing at all to lessen the public's view of the pusillanimity of politicians; and, secondly, it puts people like me even more on my guard when I see a Bill entitled "Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Bill". Would I be completely wrong if I had a suspicion that here was another issue masquerading as a cover for yet more unpalatable items to emerge in time?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para92"></a> Let me say, firmly, that I am by nature totally unfazed by requests for information from government departments; I am slightly more fazed when such requests are couched in unintelligible English and are contained in forms many pages long; I freak out. Indeed, I am a strong and very keen supporter of the suggestion that we should have a national identity card, but I am suspicious of this piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para93"></a>Reading through the Bill and the Explanatory Notes, I felt completely bemused by the complexity of the information required and the extent of the process necessary to get it. In these days of electronic data transfer, surely there must be a way whereby the submission of just one piece of data&#151;namely, one's national insurance number&#151;could achieve the objective of discovering whether an individual was or was not eligible for a free television licence. There must be a software programme somewhere which could produce this information from the national insurance records. I am sure that the Minister will tell me why <P>


<a name="column_1838"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this is not possible, but it appears to me that at every turn we try to make life a lot more complicated than it needs to be and open more opportunities for fraud.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para94"></a>The unwelcome development of a suspicious mind where heretofore all was innocence and light has led me to cogitate on what possible reason there could be for so much information, in addition to the national insurance number, being placed in the hands of the BBC or the organisation subcontracted to the BBC for the purposes of collecting the licence fee. I hope that I may not have stumbled on a genuine move to erode the principle that the licence fee funds public service broadcasting in this country.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para95"></a>I agree that the granting of free TV licences to those aged 75 and over&#151;a segment of the population which probably has little alternative entertainment&#151;can be viewed as a good thing. But there are many other segments of the population which could have almost equal claims to such a gift from the Treasury&#151;single mothers, young disabled, youth unemployed, people suffering from agoraphobia, people who have incipient claustrophobia; the list is endless. All such people could produce a genuine, well-argued case stating that TV is the only form of entertainment and education they enjoy. This would be the thin end of the wedge, which could do away with the funding by the licence fee principle. I hope that I am wrong.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para96"></a>Sadly, however, in his opening speech the Minister made me feel that I may not be wrong. When he was describing the meaning behind the clauses he indicated that the inclusion of the words in Clause 2,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for which no fee is payable or reduced-fee licences",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-19_para97"></a>
could cover further situations where there may be free TV licences.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para98"></a>The noble Lord referred to people of 75 and over as being in the sector where more people are in poor health or socially isolated. If people who are in poor health or socially isolated are to be regarded as candidates for free TV licences&#151;as we all know, there are people in poor health and socially isolated in all areas of the population&#151;as I said, this could be the thin end of the wedge which could do away with the principle of funding public broadcasting by the licence fee. Is this being set in motion?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para99"></a>Turning to my noble friend's Bill, I do so admire the punctilious nature of the immensely hard work that she conducts on every bit of legislation that she takes on board. Yet again she has discovered a flaw in the proposed legislation and, to me, it makes eminent sense to support her Bill. I hope that the Minister will agree with her and iron out the wrinkles in the proposed legislation.

<A NAME="00615-19_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House long because, between them, my two noble friends have covered many of the points I wish to raise.
<P>


<a name="column_1839"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para100"></a>Turning, first, to the Government's Bill, I understand that, given the policy they have adopted, they need some practical means of ensuring that the right people get the concession. However, I have reservations about extending this principle to something other than criminal or other matters. It is widening the disclosure of information and I want to be convinced that this is the only way that it can be done.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para101"></a>My main concern is the principle of having free television licences for people of 75 and over because, however attractive this may look&#151;and it looks very seductive at first glance&#151;it is the wrong way of bringing benefits to pensioners. I believe firmly that people should be given as great a choice as possible, which means giving them money rather than a particular benefit of which they may or may not be able to make use.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para102"></a> I agree that these days most people have a television, but what of the minority who do not, for whatever reason? Would they not welcome the equivalent in money of &#163;104 a year? For those who do not have a television set, &#163;2 a week in money would have been very welcome. It illustrates the point I am trying to make: that this is not the right route to go down. In my past experience of dealing with constituents, nothing makes people more aggravated and annoyed than a concession which all cannot enjoy or where anomalies arise.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para103"></a>That brings me to my noble friend's Bill. I applaud her for seeking to bring some sense into the anomalies that exist, but, when one goes down this route, anomalies are likely to arise One is reminded of the Hydra in Greek legend. The Hydra was a creature with many heads. As fast as one head was cut off three sprang up in its place. I believe that that is the kind of scenario which will result from the introduction by the Government of this set of concessions. That was clearly illustrated by the introduction of an order which contained a mistake in its wording. What was intended to be a concession made matters far worse, which my noble friend now seeks to put right. That was wonderfully illustrated by my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para104"></a>Those in sheltered accommodation aged over 75 can have a free television licence for televisions in their rooms but not in the communal room. That is an absurdity. I hope that the Government are prepared to look favourably on my noble friend's Private Member's Bill; or, if not, at least to take it on board in their own legislation. It is unfair to continue in this way. In short, I believe that the Government have made a serious mistake in introducing a major concession which leads to administrative cost and anomalies. I hope that the Government do not go further down that road.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para105"></a>In conclusion, I ask the Minister one question. Apart from the cost to the Government of this concession, how much will it cost administratively on the basis of the Bill that they have introduced? Is that cost likely to remain the same or could it increase? I give my noble friend's Bill a warm welcome, but I am less happy about the Bill introduced by the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-19_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, as has been said by the noble Baronesses who have spoken, offering the over-75s the opportunity to have a free television licence is an attractive idea. Why it should be introduced at this stage is a mystery, because there are other things in our national life which are as urgent. The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, said that there were several other classes of people who might well benefit from a similar concession. I agree. However, this is the idea that has been arrived at.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para106"></a>As I understood the observations of the Secretary of State in the other place, it is necessary to guard against the possibility of multiple licences being sought by persons who are relatives of the old age pensioner, or the man next door, the window cleaner and so on. Therefore, some means must be found to limit fraud, as far as possible, in providing these concessionary licences. The Bill gives the BBC the right to apply to the Department of Social Security for certain information. On the face of it, the information is fairly basic and does not pose a danger to society by way of the release of information which should be held confidential. However, this may well be the thin end of the wedge.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para107"></a>The procedures for claiming the free licence appear to be simple enough. However, one is concerned that a good number of people do not understand their right to claim. Often the literature and publications which go out are not easy to comprehend, even for those who are used to reading a lot of material. Perhaps the Minister can tell us something about the Government's plans to promote proper information for the benefit for those who qualify for this concession. For some years the Campaign for Plain English has pointed out, effectively and very amusingly, the convoluted nature of some of the information that is provided. I hope that that is not necessary here.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para108"></a>I am not as sanguine as the Secretary of State who believes it is unlikely that there will be any significant fraud. I am not necessarily a suspicious person, but I believe that there will be attempts at fraud, as there always are when benefits are available. I know not whether there will be widespread copying or forging of these documents. I hope that the Government have carefully thought out all the possible methods by which this benefit can be abused. The principles seem right to us and we do not question the good will behind them.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para109"></a> The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, referred to the insignificant rise in the old age pension. I do not follow her down that road. However, as I understand it&#151;it is not my subject&#151;the increase of 75p is linked to the cost of living index and there is no room for generosity in that area. The noble Baroness appears to ridicule my remarks. If I am wrong, I shall be put right. It is an insignificant amount, but if that is the way it is calculated so be it. If the Conservatives get in at the next election, perhaps they will change it. We on these Benches regard that as an unlikely scenario. However, I am a betting man and if anyone tells me otherwise I shall have a wager on it.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para110"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, highlighted two anomalies in this area. In the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, both seem to be absurdities. If they cannot be corrected, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what the complications are. I say nothing further on that.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para111"></a>On the face of it, the cost&#151;&#163;350 million-odd, not counting any fraud and the policing of it&#151;seems to be very high. I believe that there is widespread evasion of the payment of the television licence fee. I wonder whether with these procedures the Government have at the back of their mind better ways to limit the number of people who evade that payment. From my own observations&#151;the Minister should not feel obliged to deal with this matter&#151;the detector vans remind me of my military service. In those days, one had vehicles made of wood which looked like tanks. A good number of these vans, which appear to have only one casual occupant, perambulate about. I wonder whether they really do anything or simply alarm people so that they scurry to the Post Office for a TV licence. If so, how many people scurry to the Post Office, and what is the cost of the operation? Is it cost effective? That is purely a personal observation and perhaps I fantasise.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para112"></a>I have nothing further to say. I am happy for those who will enjoy this benefit and hope that it does not lead to any unforeseen problems or troubles.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-19_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   My Lords, this has been a most interesting debate. As my noble friend Lady Anelay said, we on these Benches believe that pensioners would prefer to have monetary concessions integrated into their state pension so that all pensioners would benefit from any spare money that the Chancellor has available. However, as it stands, we support the TV licence concession for those aged over 75 and I support my noble friend's Private Member's Bill for the reasons that she gave.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para113"></a>The concession does nothing for those who receive a pension but who are aged under 75. The question also arises of households which include a 75 year-old but which do not have a TV set. Effectively, the free TV licence is a &#163;104 per year additional benefit for owning a TV set. That benefit is of course conferred on anyone who lives in a household which includes a 75 year-old, whatever their means or age. What about those who live in an area where the analogue signal cannot be received?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para114"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, asked the Government in a Written Question on 25th May last (WA 107) whether they would pay those pensioners who do not have a TV set the equivalent of the cost of a licence. On that occasion, the Minister replied that the purpose of the concession is to assist access to television and not to provide a cash benefit. Does not the Minister agree that those pensioners may feel aggrieved that they are some &#163;100-odd a year worse off than their neighbours as a result of this scheme?
<P>


<a name="column_1842"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1842</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para115"></a>The scheme holds many implications for the BBC. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain made plain her suspicions that it seems to imply that the taxpayer is taking a direct financial stake in the BBC. As the Government determine each year whether or not to continue funding the scheme, that means that nearly 15 per cent of the BBC's income will come to depend on government goodwill. That, in its turn, unsettles the BBC's unique funding mechanism.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para116"></a>Of course, if the benefit were to be extended to households which included a 65 year-old&#151;here I must state a small personal interest in such a possibility!&#151;then the taxpayer would take a direct interest in more than one-third of the total BBC funding. As my noble friend Lady O'Cathain said, it could go even further.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para117"></a>Can the Minister assure us that the stake taken in the BBC will not lead to interference in the way that programmes are made or to a change in the editorial independence of the corporation? Of course, it is natural for the BBC to welcome the scheme as it not only guarantees income from 3 million viewers without having to chase up non-payers (provided, of course, the Government pay up), it also underpins the system of holding a licence before anyone can view a TV or video.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para118"></a>It would be wrong not to give great consideration to the cost of the scheme. Estimates seem to vary. At Second Reading in another place the Minister, Janet Anderson, stated that the costs could be higher than in earlier estimates. Of course, the costs are bound to depend on the number of beneficiaries. When can we expect to receive indications of that number and, therefore, the subsequent definitive cost estimates?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para119"></a>The Bill is short, but it introduces a scheme which appears to be complex to operate and which therefore may be confusing to many people. For example, the measure will require 75 year-olds to opt into the scheme. They will not receive the benefit automatically. They will still have to apply for a TV licence, even though they will not have to pay for it.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para120"></a>Therefore, we need to hear what steps the Government are taking to ensure a proper understanding of the measure among those whom it is intended to benefit. For example, how will the Government ensure that eligible pensioners do not confuse free licences with no licences? And will the Minister confirm that pensioners aged 75 and over who have a TV and no licence will still be liable to prosecution for a criminal offence and therefore subject to fine?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para121"></a>What discussions have the Government had with the TV licensing authority about its policy on this matter and, indeed, what discussions have they had with the Magistrates' Association? Will people who fail to apply for a licence be treated differently from those who refuse to apply after having been advised of the procedure? Indeed, will they be subject to fine and, <P>


<a name="column_1843"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if they refuse to pay, to prison? That seems to be the implication of the statement made by the Minister, Janet Anderson, again at Second Reading in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government are not in the business of sending 80-year-olds to prison because they were perhaps confused about the rules".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 10/6/00; col. 154.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-19_para122"></a>
 Therefore, if they know the rules but do not want to apply for a free licence, will they be punished?
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para123"></a>We all want to do the best that we can for our pensioners, who so patently have earned their rewards, though, as my noble friend Lady Fookes said, this is not really the best way to help them. However, as I and my noble friend Lady Anelay said, in the circumstances, we shall certainly support the measure as it stands.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para124"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister respond to the debate. It must be his umpteenth speech today and his last. I congratulate him on his stamina.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-19_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. Perhaps I may be allowed to say that on behalf of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, too.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para125"></a>I should like, first, to respond to the issues raised by her Bill and then to say something about the debate on the government Bill. I begin by congratulating the noble Baroness on her eloquent advocacy of her Bill, and pay tribute to the way in which she has approached it and to the advice that she has received from Abbeyfield and Age Concern. I have an interest in Abbeyfield. I am president of one of its societies and I have a step-mother-in-law who is aged 96 and in an Abbeyfield extra-care home. That gives me some knowledge of one or two of the issues raised in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para126"></a>The starting point must be that the accommodation for residential care concessionary television licence scheme is full of anomalies. It has been full of anomalies right from the beginning. It generates complaints from residents in sheltered accommodation which fails to qualify, from managers of that accommodation, and from elderly and disabled people in mainstream accommodation who feel that they are equally deserving of special treatment. The scheme has been reviewed on several occasions since it was first introduced in the 1960s. A number of changes have been made to it to try to address those anomalies, but none of them has been successful.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para127"></a>The most recent review was that undertaken last year by the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC, chaired by Gavyn Davies and commissioned by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The panel considered the structure of the scheme and whether a suitable alternative might be found. In its report, which it published last July, the panel recommended that the current scheme should be retained as no superior alternative funded from the licence fee could be found. The Government accepted that recommendation. However, we made one minor change to the regulations which govern the scheme in order to bring the qualifying age for men and women <P>


<a name="column_1844"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into line at 60, whereas previously the regulations referred to "pensionable age", so that women could qualify from the age of 60 but men were eligible only from the age of 65.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para128"></a>Most of the difficulties of the scheme stem from the fact that the entitlement depends on the accommodation occupied and the way in which it is provided or managed, rather than on the circumstances of the individual. That means that the rules which govern the scheme are often arbitrary or unfair. In our view, our introduction of half-price television licences for registered blind people from 1st April this year and of free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1st November target concessions where they are needed.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para129"></a>Over 3 million households will benefit from free licences for the over-75s, compared with about 650,000 beneficiaries of the current concessionary scheme. The rationale for these concessions is well understood both by claimants and by the general public. Many of those receiving a free licence from 1st November are likely to be people who narrowly fail to qualify for the &#163;5 concessionary licence.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para130"></a>The noble Baroness's Bill would make a number of changes to the concessionary scheme. The &#163;5 concessionary licence is currently available only for television sets installed in the private accommodation of people living in residential homes or qualifying sheltered housing. The Bill aims to extend the concession to cover TV sets installed in communal rooms in qualifying accommodation, provided they are intended for use solely by residents. If all the residents are aged 75 or over, the Bill would provide a free television licence to cover any sets installed in communal areas.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para131"></a>That concession would benefit housing managers rather than residents because housing managers pay the licence fee for the communal set. Some managers may pass on the benefit to residents via a reduction in their charges, but there will be no requirement to do so. Those changes would represent an additional concession for accommodation where the residents already qualify for a concessionary licence. They would not help housing schemes which fail to qualify, to which the great majority of complaints about the concessionary scheme relate.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para132"></a>The provision that, in order to qualify for the concession, communal rooms must be intended for use solely by residents may also cause problems. Anyone who has been to one of these homes knows that visitors kneel or sit by the side of their elderly relatives. That cannot be avoided and visitors cannot be excluded in order to secure entitlement to the concession. The requirement for all residents to be over 75 would present difficulties. A single resident below that age would disqualify the scheme. Would it provide a perverse incentive to exclude someone from admission to the home because they were under 75 and the home would lose the licence? I do not believe so, but that is still an anomaly.
<P>


<a name="column_1845"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para133"></a> The Bill also seeks to ensure that people over 75 who currently qualify for the &#163;5 licence get a free television licence for their private rooms. Of course, they will do so under the Government's Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para134"></a>Clause 1(3) of the noble Baroness's Bill would extend the concessionary scheme to sheltered housing schemes which included male residents aged 60 to 64 who continue to be employed. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has explained that this provision is intended to address an anomaly created by the extension of the concessionary scheme to men aged between 60 and 64.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para135"></a>The requirement for residents to be retired has long been a part of the regulations. It applies not only to men aged between 60 and 64 but also to other residents in sheltered housing schemes. Therefore, the effect of this provision would be to create a situation where sheltered housing schemes could qualify for the concession if they included male residents aged 60 to 64 who continued to work but not if they included a woman aged 60 or over who continued to work, nor a man aged 65 or over who continued to work.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para136"></a>I am sorry to have been critical about the detail. Of course, the Government are strictly neutral on Private Members' Bills and we shall not seek to obstruct the Bill's passage in any way. But we are not persuaded that the Bill would improve the scheme or resolve what we acknowledge are major anomalies. In defence of the Bill, over the years a number of able and eminent people have turned their minds to how the concessionary scheme may be improved, most recently by the Gavyn Davies review. But they have been unable to identify any improvements which would make the scheme generally acceptable, and I am afraid this Bill is no exception.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para137"></a>I now turn to the points raised on the Government's Bill and I shall seek to address those as succinctly as I reasonably can. First, I recognise the sincerity of the noble Baronesses, Lady O'Cathain, Lady Fookes and Lady Anelay, who have expressed reservations about the fundamental policy behind it&#151;the over-75 licence concession. I recognise the sincerity and I understand the arguments that they use. As they are Members of the Opposition, I shall simply say that the Members of the Opposition in another place, although willing to wound, were not prepared to strike, in the sense that they were not willing for anybody to go to their constituencies and say, "Your Conservative MP voted against free television licences for the over-75s". That has been the limit of the disagreement on the issues of policy.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para138"></a> I have not heard, even from the noble Lord, Lord Luke, who was the only noble Lord to address the issue, any serious suggestion that there are alternative ways of achieving that policy other than that proposed in the Bill. Fears have been expressed, and I shall try to address them as best as I can, but nobody has suggested a better alternative. In my opening speech I hope that I indicated why we came to the conclusion that this is the best way of dealing with the matter.
<P>


<a name="column_1846"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1846</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para139"></a>I shall turn now to the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on Clause 1(2) relating to BBC subcontractors. I can give her a full assurance on that. The regime proposed for BBC subcontractors is exactly the same as that used by the DSS, which for many years has used subcontractors to process the data in question. That has been done under the social security administration legislation, the most recent Act being in 1992. At the same time, the BBC does not have a diverse group of contractors carrying out the work; it has a tightly knit group coming under the heading of TV licensing, with four companies that join together to provide those services. I have no reason to suppose that there have been significant breaches of confidence in the use of contractors, and I have no reason to suppose that there will be for the BBC. Incidentally, Post Office counter clerks will not have access to any confidential data.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para140"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred to the problem raised by Mr Greenway in another place about the dangers of accidental disclosure of information. Of course, we are sympathetic. If one is reckless or just stupid one can easily release information by accident, particularly with electronic communications in place. The noble Baroness may have read Philip Roth's latest novel in which one of the characters produces on her PC a lonely hearts advertisement that she intends to send to a lonely hearts contact club and by accident she presses the "Send all" button and the information is sent to all her colleagues in her university department. Such things can happen.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para141"></a>As regards personal information, we have the same protection in this Bill as in Section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which makes it an offence to release personal information. It gives a defence in that the person charged with the offence has to prove that the disclosure was made in the reasonable, even mistaken, belief that he or she was making the disclosure with lawful authority, or that the information was already public. I do not know whether that reassures the noble Baroness. I am not sure that it entirely reassures me, because I do not believe that this is a problem to which there is any easy answer.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para142"></a> The noble Baroness raised the point on the new Clause 4 about defining the directors' duty to include whether neglect can be attributed to them. We do not believe that it is possible in every circumstance in legislation to define what a director must do. That must be a matter for the courts to apply. It is a well-precedented provision that we do not believe has caused any difficulty in the past. In this particular case we believe that it should be clear to directors that their organisation must put in place systems to prevent unlawful disclosure if they are not to risk mistakes that could lead to prosecution. Of course, if there are any amendments on that point in Committee, we shall listen carefully to them, as we always do.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para143"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, said that this Bill had raised her cynical antennae. I do not think of the noble Baroness as cynical; I think of her as an exponent of the highest scepticism&#151;except, of course, <P>


<a name="column_1847"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column 1847</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in religion. I do not believe that her fears are justified here. The additional information required other than a person's national insurance number is only that which is absolutely essential for administrative purposes: name, address and date of birth. I do not think it would be possible to require less than that.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para144"></a>Both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Luke, expressed concern about the licence fee principle. I should have thought that that point had already been answered fully when we set up the inquiry into BBC funding led by Gavyn Davies and published its report in July last year. We also published our response which makes it clear that, for the foreseeable future, we are dedicated to maintaining the principle of funding the BBC via the licence fee. I do not believe that any erosion of the licence fee funding principle will take place once 15 per cent of the funds come from the taxpayer. That is because no additional powers have been put in place for the Government to influence the amount of money that goes to the BBC. The Government have no control over the quantity of money that is taken from the taxpayer through concessionary licences for over 75 year-olds. That money will, as always, go directly to the BBC.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para145"></a>As regards the commitment to public sector broadcasting, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Luke, will be reassured by the fact that the BBC charter is still in effect. It has been extended on a number of occasions. Although eventually there must be a review of the charter, nothing that this Government have done could give rise to any suspicion that we are in any way damaging the independence of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para146"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, asked about the costs of setting up and maintaining this concession. Costs in terms of the amount taxpayers will have to pay for the replacement of paid licence fees are roughly &#163;340 million per year. In terms of administration, in 2001 the costs will amount to around to &#163;24.3 million; a great deal of that sum will form the set-up costs. The figure will reduce in succeeding years to around &#163;10 million per year. In terms of the amount of tax collected, that sum will not be particularly significant.

<a name="00615-19_para147"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, and the noble Lord, Lord Luke, asked about our plans for promotion. In my opening speech, I told the House that a mailshot will be sent to every household within the next few months, well before 1st November&#151;including to all Members of this House. If, as I hope, the mailshot is properly designed, it will make clear not only who is entitled but how that entitlement is to be exercised.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para148"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, asked about the rate of television licence fee evasion. My understanding is that 95 per cent of all licence fees are paid. I do not think that it is a significant issue as regards the granting of this concession.
<P>

<a name="00615-19_para149"></a>I apologise to the House if I have missed any questions. I shall read in Hansard what has been said during our debate and write to noble Lords if that is necessary. I am grateful that no objections in principle have been expressed as regards the government Bill, or to the way&#151;other than on points of detail which will be dealt with in Committee&#151;in which the Government have implemented the necessary procedures to give effect to free television licences for those aged 75 and over.

Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at Report stage, when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

However, paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 6 of Schedule A1 currently say that the directors can "apply for" a moratorium. That might be taken as implying that an application to court is necessary and that the application will then have to be determined in some way by the court before a moratorium can be obtained. To avoid the possibility of these paragraphs being interpreted in that way, we propose that they be amended to make it clear that no application to court is necessary to obtain a moratorium. I beg to move.

<a name="00615-20_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 5, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 6, 24, 28, 67, 84 and 86. Paragraph 6(2)(a) of the new Schedule A1 inserted by paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Bill provides for the nominee to submit a statement to the directors as regards his opinion on, among other things, whether or not the proposed voluntary arrangement has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para17"></a>It is, however, open to the creditors meeting to approve the proposed voluntary arrangement with modifications. Paragraph 6(2)(a) does not refer to any possible modifications that might be proposed by the creditors. On one view, the nominee in forming his opinion should not take into account such modifications. This point is made good if one looks at paragraph 22(1)(a) and 23(2)(a)(i), which refer only to modifications under paragraph 29(7), which are modifications for which the directors intend to seek the approval of the meeting. It appears to be intended that the nominee can have regard to only those modifications proposed by the director and only if he has received notice of them. He must therefore ignore all other possible modifications. That, we believe, imposes far too strict a test.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para18"></a>In essence, the nominee has to form a view on whether the proposed moratorium has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented. He might form that view that it needs only minor modifications and might be confident that in that case it has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para19"></a>Paragraph 6 does not permit him to have regard to those minor changes, so he cannot submit the statement. In other places in the Bill he is entitled to certain specific modifications. At first sight this might <P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>appear to be a pure drafting point, but by looking at paragraph 22(1)(a) and 23(2)(a)(i) one sees that he is entitled to have regard to some modifications, and therefore by saying some, it automatically means not all. We believe that this conflict would easily be cured by adding, where appropriate, a number of "with or without modifications".
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para20"></a>With all due deference, it appears to us that perhaps in certain areas the drafting has been done by different individuals. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   These amendments would mean that the nominee would be required to consider not only the proposed voluntary arrangement as it stands before him at the point of time at which he is required to consider it, whether in relation to a company or an individual, but also the proposed voluntary arrangement in the light of any modifications which might possibly be made to it.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para21"></a>We consider that the nominee should look at the proposed individual or proposed company voluntary arrangement as he understands it will be put to the creditors and, if applicable, to shareholders. The Bill, as drafted, already makes provision for the nominee to consider the proposal as amended by any modification notified to him by the directors. We would not want him to consider it as it might conceivably be modified.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para22"></a>The directors might never be prepared to agree to further modifications, in which case the meetings would be unlikely to approve and implement the voluntary arrangement. We would not want the company to, say, be able to obtain a moratorium in such circumstances as it would be entirely inappropriate. Indeed, it would undermine the necessary confidence of the nominee that the moratorium was justified. The amendments would also place an unreasonable burden on nominees, who would be obliged to make decisions on the basis of what inevitably would be conjecture.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para23"></a>It is very unusual for a voluntary arrangement to be prepared before the moratorium starts without the proposed nominee being a party to its drafting. I understand the desire of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for more flexibility, but I think that amendments of this kind would lead to the risk that moratoriums were put forward before they had been properly thought out and agreed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response to the amendments, although I cannot agree with what he has said. I shall want to read his words carefully in Hansard. It appears to be intended that the nominee can have regard only to those modifications proposed by the directors, and only if he has received notice. We believe that that is too strict. We do not think that we are being too flexible by making the suggested changes. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="00615-20_para26"></a><P>

<a name="00615-20_para27"></a>The noble Baroness said: Paragraph 8(3) of new Schedule A1 provides for the moratorium to end if either the meeting of the company or the meeting of its creditors has not first met before the end of the specified period. If no one turns up to the meeting of the company it may be said that the meeting has not been held. The moratorium will therefore end at the end of the specified period. However, paragraph 34 of the new Schedule A1 makes it clear that if the meeting of the company and the meeting of the creditors come to different decisions, the decision of the meeting of the creditors is to take effect subject to an application to the court by a member of the company. We entirely agree with that provision. Once a company's financial affairs are such that a moratorium is appropriate, the views of creditors must be paramount.
<P>

<a name="00615-20_para28"></a>The possibility of members not turning up to the meeting of the company and bringing the moratorium to an end in accordance with paragraph 8(3) is, therefore, we believe, inconsistent with the principle that the creditors' views are paramount. If creditors' views are paramount surely it is wrong for the moratorium to end just because members do not turn up. It is even conceivable that members might decide not to bother to hold a meeting and so destroy any prospect of a moratorium. They may ask why they should bother to attend, and quite often members are simply not interested; they say "There is nothing in it for us so why bother?". That does happen in practice. Indeed, it is possible, and does happen, that one might have to go so far as to offer something to them in order for them to turn up, something which otherwise would go to the creditors. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for her explanation of the amendment. It seems to me to devalue the role of the company's shareholders, who, after all, will remain as the company's owners if the rescue is successful, in deliberations about whether or not a moratorium should be extended beyond the initial period of 28 days. We are talking about the extension of the moratorium and not the original setting-up of the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para0"></a>We take the view that any decision to extend a moratorium should be considered by both the company and its creditors. The question at issue is that of agreement of a proposal which is presumably, and has to be, a proposal by the company's directors for a voluntary arrangement. I invite the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, not to lose sight of the fact that the Bill does not introduce a new voluntary arrangement procedure. The arrangement will still be under Section 1 of the Insolvency Act. It will still be the one for a composition in satisfaction of the company's debts or a scheme of arrangement of its affairs. It will still be a proposal made,

That is why paragraph 8(3) provides for the moratorium to end automatically if either of the meetings summoned under paragraph 27&#151;that is, either the company or the creditors' meeting&#151;has not met within 28 days of the start of the moratorium. They do not have to be concluded but both must have been held in order for the moratorium not to come&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   It may be helpful to interrupt the Minister now, because the last thing we want to do is destroy the possibility of a moratorium. That is not what we are seeking here. What we seek is a situation whereby the creditors do not lose out because the members have not had a meeting. The shareholders' position has already been devalued, in which case we believe the creditors' position should be paramount, and that loss of position would occur, in our view, if the members do not have a meeting and therefore the moratorium comes to an end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The moratorium had already started because we are talking about extension, are we not? The moratorium had already started and for it to be in force by the end of the 28 days&#151;in other words, not to have collapsed&#151;both the members and the creditors must have had meetings, and they have to agree this will happen. A nominee has to be appointed and if necessary a successor supervisor must have been appointed; so the moratorium is in action at this stage.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para2"></a>These amendments are not about starting a moratorium but the extension of the moratorium. I do not know whether that is what is intended. I hope it is. We are saying that an extension of a moratorium has to be considered both by the company and its creditors. If it is not agreed by the company, for whatever reason, either by it not having a meeting or not turning up to one, it should not be extended and then one has to go into insolvency procedures. It could not be continued on the opinion only of the creditors; that would make no sense. The nominee could not continue with it or have any confidence that it had a reasonable prospect of success if the directors of the company have not had a meeting and responded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   Surely then the creditors might lose out of this voluntary arrangement because of the apathy of the members.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If the directors are not willing to go on with a moratorium under any circumstances, whatever the reason, it has to come to an end. The nominee has to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of success. Clearly, if the directors have no confidence, there is no reasonable prospect of success, the moratorium has to come to an end and the company has to be declared insolvent. The moratorium has failed and it does not matter exactly how it is brought to an end, whether by the creditors or by the company. But both sides have to be in agreement for it to be extended.

<a name="00615-21_para4"></a><P>

<a name="00615-21_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 8, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 9. Paragraph 10 of the new Schedule 1A provides for the nominee to advertise and notify the Registrar of Companies, the company itself and any petitioning creditor of the moratorium. In our view, all the creditors of the company should be informed of the moratorium, if only so that they know not to bother to take any of the steps referred to in paragraph 12.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para6"></a>In essence, let us suppose that an existing creditor is not paid and presents a winding-up order provision and then suddenly realises that what he has done is in breach of paragraph 12. What would happen if a debentureholder or a landlord takes proceedings for possession of the lease, or a sheriff wants to go in and levy distress, or the Inland Revenue wants to move? We believe that the provision is unworkable in its present form.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para7"></a>It is of paramount importance that all the creditors of the company should be informed so that they can act accordingly, in which case they would not be in breach of paragraph 12. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We are mirroring exactly, or certainly as far as applicable, the procedures that apply to the notification of an Administration and Winding Up Order under the 1986 Insolvency Rules. In those cases, at the outset, as we intend here, the commencement of the procedure is advertised and also notified to the Registrar of Companies so that the information is available on the company's public record, and then creditors are made aware of the start of the procedure when they are individually notified of the meeting of creditors. We do not see why notice in moratorium cases should be any different. We can see why all creditors, of whose claim the nominee is aware, should be made aware of the moratorium, but the moratorium is only 28 days and the nominee will be contacting all the creditors very soon after it comes into force to notify them of the meeting of creditors, to consider the proposal for a voluntary arrangement. They will obviously learn of the moratorium at that early stage.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para8"></a>To have to notify them twice in a short space of time would involve unnecessary expense. I cannot see what advantage would be gained from it. The moratorium procedure is a low-cost one, or it will not work at all. Although, strictly speaking, there is a possible interval in time between the notification which these amendments would provide and the notification of the meeting, it is a very short gap which does not justify departing from the procedure I have already described in regard to a winding-up order. In any case, if a creditor tries to do something forbidden by the moratorium, someone from the company will tell him or her when they try to do it. The same type of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>provision exists as regards administration. In those cases, where a creditor tries to take action, the administrator informs him or her of the moratorium.

<a name="00615-21_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: New Schedule A1 sets out the effects of a moratorium under Section 1A of the Insolvency Act 1986. In general terms, it prevents third parties from enforcing their rights against the company during the period when the moratorium is in force.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para13"></a>Paragraph 12 of New Schedule A1 deals with the effects of the moratorium which substantially interfere with the rights of creditors. An administration order, of course, has similar effects. As the Minister is well aware, however, there is an important distinction. The moratorium which comes into effect in the case of an administration order is subject to the court's control within five days of the presentation of the petition. The moratorium under paragraph 12, by contrast, comes into effect on the authority of a person who is likely to have substantially less experience than an insolvency practitioner and perhaps less testing qualifications.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para14"></a>At the very least, the creditor must be entitled to apply to the court to take one or more of the steps referred to in paragraph 12, and not just in those instances where reference is made to the leave of the court. To save unnecessary applications to the court, the consent of the nominee should suffice as well. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-21_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The purpose of paragraph 12 of Schedule A1, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, rightly says, is to provide protection from legal action for a company which is subject to a moratorium. In particular, there is a general ban on other insolvency-related procedures being commenced during the period of the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para15"></a>If the court&#151;or the nominee, for that matter&#151;were able to grant leave to permit another insolvency procedure to be commenced during the moratorium, which would be the effect of these amendments, the situation would arise where two conflicting insolvency procedures could be on foot at the same time&#151;one, a company voluntary arrangement moratorium and the other, a liquidation. Those procedures would have competing and conflicting purposes and that would not be a situation we would want to allow. The objective of a moratorium is to give the company the opportunity to put a rescue plan to its creditors.

<P>

<a name="00615-21_para16"></a>We should not lose sight of the fact that the initial moratorium is very short. Any other co-existing or supplanting insolvency procedure would thwart that rescue attempt. For that reason we do not consider that the court should be able to permit other insolvency procedures to be commenced during a moratorium. The only exceptions to that principle should be where a petition is presented by the Secretary of State or the Bank of England in the limited circumstances specified in paragraph 12(5) of Schedule A1.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para17"></a>Clearly, where the nominee considers insolvency proceedings are appropriate, he can no longer be of the opinion that the voluntary arrangement has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented. It seems self-evident that he will have to withdraw his consent under paragraph 23 and bring the moratorium to an immediate end.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para18"></a>If a creditor considers another form of insolvency procedure appropriate he should tell the nominee who, if suitable, could withdraw his consent to act and, in that way too, bring the moratorium to an end. The meeting of the company's creditors would also provide the creditor with an opportunity to express his concerns and vote against any extension of the moratorium or approval of the proposed voluntary arrangement.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para19"></a>We do not consider it appropriate for the nominee to be allowed to authorise a breach of the statutory moratorium in respect of paragraph 12(1)(f)&#151;that is, leave to enforce security&#151;or paragraph 12(1) (g)&#151;that is, leave to take proceedings. These are matters which, in our view, the court should decide.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para20"></a>The situation is rather different, however, in relation to the calling or requisitioning of a company meeting. The members of a company may need to meet in order to satisfy certain obligations under the Companies Act. That is why we have made provision for a nominee to consent to such a meeting under paragraph 12(1)(b) or for the court to give leave for such a meeting.
<P>

<a name="00615-21_para21"></a>I am sorry that we are not able to support these amendments.

<A NAME="00615-21_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister for his brisk reply. Perhaps I should say that he seems to exaggerate the problem of two separate winding-up procedures. If a winding-up order is made, the moratorium would come to an end. There would then only be one insolvency procedure&#151;that of liquidation.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is why in those circumstances, we do not need the amendment. The other circumstances that I have outlined would bring the moratorium to an end. The moratorium comes to an end, most obviously, if the nominee loses confidence in it. It can, however, come to an end if the creditors' meeting votes against it and the nominee loses confidence in it&#151;if a significant shareholder indicates his objection to its continuation. If it comes to an end, naturally liquidation proceedings would <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>then be appropriate. If people are agreed&#151;if the shareholders, where appropriate, the company and the creditors are agreed&#151;by votes in both meetings that the moratorium should continue, it seems somehow wrong that there should be the alternative, destructive procedure starting in the middle of a moratorium. It is after all, rather a short moratorium.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   The noble Lord has, possibly, made my point for me; but I shall look carefully in Hansard to see whether or not that assessment is correct. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-22_para2"></a><P>

<a name="00615-22_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: There is another important difference between the moratorium in paragraph 12 and that which arises when an administration petition is presented; it relates to the position of a debentureholder. As noble Lords are by now aware, under paragraph 12 it is proposed that in some instances a third party can enforce its rights against a company if it obtains the consent of the nominee or the leave of the court.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para4"></a>The leave of the court can, of course, be granted on terms. For example, a landlord who wants to take proceedings to forfeit a lease can apply for the leave of the court. If he does, the court may give him leave and may impose terms, such as ordering that he can only take proceedings for forfeiture if the company does not pay the rent during the moratorium. Such an order would prevent a landlord from taking advantage of the past indebtedness but would give him priority during the course of the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para5"></a>In contrast, some third parties are not given the right to apply to the court for leave to enforce their rights. An example of this is a debentureholder who wishes to appoint an administrative receiver. Thus, there are two classes of rights: those which can be enforced with the leave of the court and those which cannot be enforced even with that leave. Rights that can be enforced with the leave of the court include calling or requisitioning a meeting of the company, taking steps to enforce security over the company's property, repossessing goods in the company's possession under any hire purchase agreement, commencing or continuing proceedings, execution or other legal process and levying distress against the company or its property.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para6"></a>By contrast, the other rights referred to in the paragraph cannot be enforced at all, even with the leave of the court: no petition can be presented to wind up the company; no resolution may be passed or order made for the winding-up of the company; no petition for an administration order may be presented; and no administrative receiver of the company may be appointed. However meritorious the claim, those rights cannot be enforced.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para7"></a>It is difficult to see any policy reasons for the distinction between the two classes. The distinction is also unreal if one considers the position of a <P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debentureholder with a debenture containing fixed and floating charges. A debentureholder will be able to enforce the fixed charges in the debenture with the leave of the court, but will not be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver under the floating charge. Why should that be the position?
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para8"></a>The position is particularly odd as regards a debentureholder who wants to appoint an administrative receiver under the floating charge. That is because the approval of the voluntary arrangement brings the moratorium to an end and the voluntary arrangement cannot prevent the debentureholder from appointing an administrative receiver. It seems extraordinary that a debentureholder can appoint an administrative receiver if a voluntary arrangement is approved but cannot do so before it is approved while there is a chance that it might be.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para9"></a>This strange situation is even more baffling when compared with the administration order procedure. Under Section 10 of the Insolvency Act 1986, there is a limited moratorium during the period beginning with the presentation of a petition for an administration order and ending with the making of an order or the dismissal of the petition. The hearing of the petition is usually within five days. During that relatively short period, there is a limited moratorium; however, it does not prevent the presentation of a petition for the winding-up of a company or for the appointment of an administrative receiver. A debentureholder has an absolute right to appoint an administrative receiver and, if he exercises that right, the court cannot make an administration order.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para10"></a>Effectively, the debentureholder has a veto on an administration order being granted. So far as concerns a creditor who presents a winding-up petition, he is entitled to be represented at the hearing for an administration order and can argue against an administration order. Those rights are abrogated by paragraph 12 without the protection of the court; neither the debentureholder nor the creditor who wishes to present a winding-up petition has any right to apply to the court for leave to appoint an administrative receiver or present a winding-up petition. That is manifestly undesirable.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para11"></a>As a general rule, company directors will, understandably, go to almost any lengths to avoid a winding-up order. If paragraph 12 is accepted in its present form, a petition can be prevented from being presented, simply by a nominee's recommendation under the provision in paragraph 7, however strong the grounds for a winding-up petition may be.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para12"></a>Similar considerations apply with respect to the appointment of an administrative receiver. Today, one has to apply for an injunction restraining the debentureholder from appointing an administrative receiver, usually with little chance of success. In future, all one will need to do is to find an insolvency practitioner and get him to obtain a moratorium under paragraph 7, and that will prevent the debentureholder from appointing an administrative receiver. The scope for abuse is immense.

<P>

<a name="00615-22_para13"></a>As I understand it, the Government's first response to this argument is to say that it would be unacceptable to have two insolvency procedures of the same kind; but if a winding-up order is made&#151;and I have made this point already in another context&#151;the moratorium would come to an end. There would be only one insolvency procedure thereafter, and that would be liquidation.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para14"></a>The Government also say that a creditor could apply to the court to challenge the nominee's decision not to withdraw his consent; but the test is likely to be stiff. It would probably be necessary to show, in these circumstances, that the nominee's decision is manifestly unreasonable, or based on a failure to consider relevant matters, or the consideration of irrelevant matters. That could be a formidable obstacle to surmount. Why should he have to negotiate simply to present a winding-up petition or appoint an administrative receiver?
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para15"></a>We have reflected on further amendments to this paragraph. The aim of the moratorium is the approval of the proposed voluntary arrangement under paragraph 29. It prevents creditors breaking rank. Sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 29 prevents a meeting of members or creditors approving any proposal or modification which affects the right of a secure creditor to enforce the security, except with his concurrence.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para16"></a>The approval of the voluntary arrangement which the moratorium was intended to facilitate will allow secure creditors to enforce their security. However, the effect of the moratorium in paragraph 12 is to prevent secure creditors from doing so. On the one hand that seems to us to be wrong; because success in the shape of approval of the voluntary arrangement is the result of allowing a secure creditor to enforce his security, which is a mark of failure. It is therefore in the interests of unsecured creditors not to approve the voluntary arrangement in order to prevent a secure creditor from enforcing his security.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para17"></a>On the other hand, it may be desirable to forestall the secure creditors while negotiations are conducted with them with a view to their concurring in the voluntary arrangement. Furthermore, if they are secured they should be protected during the period of the moratorium and are unlikely to suffer much prejudice.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para18"></a>The Minister will no doubt be relieved to hear that, on balance, we prefer the moratorium to prevent secure creditors enforcing their security except as regards debenture holders with power to appoint administrative receivers. As I have already explained, they fall into a different category because such debentureholder security usually extends to assets that can be easily disposed of during the course of a moratorium. Accordingly, we do not propose any amendment other than this. I beg to move.

<P>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>again. This is the same argument as applied to the previous group of amendments. The only successful outcome of a moratorium is that everybody is satisfied that the business carries on and that the directors are left in charge of the business and everyone, including the debentureholders, the floating charge holders, are satisfied with whatever arrangement is agreed to. That is the only way in which a moratorium can be successful.
<P>

<a name="00615-22_para19"></a>If that is to happen, one cannot have two procedures going on at the same time. That is the fundamental argument. The amendment would reduce the benefit for a company of obtaining a moratorium. Our intention is to give the company's management a short breathing-space in which to put a rescue plan to all its creditors. The amendment could make that pointless. The amendment would mean that would be nothing to stop a floating charge holder from appointing an administrative receiver during the moratorium. That would almost certainly be disastrous for any rescue attempt.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh: </B>   I will come on to the point about the leave of the court. If that happened, with or without the leave of the court, the receiver would be in charge of the assets of the company&#151;that is what happens with receivership. He would assume control of all the company's assets and he would then presumably proceed, as receivers do, to dispose of them with a view to repaying the moneys due to the floating chargeholder, the debentureholder. We cannot see why a debentureholder should be the only creditor whose actions should not be stayed by the moratorium. If we are serious about giving companies the necessary short breathing place to put a rescue plan to all its creditors, then we have to reject this amendment. If not, the legislation, frankly, becomes a "dead letter". This could easily be a wrecking amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para0"></a>We have provided that a company is only able to obtain a moratorium if the nominee is of the view that the directors' proposal for a voluntary arrangement has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented and also that the company is likely to have sufficient funds to enable it to carry on its business during the moratorium. Thus, any company that obtains a moratorium should stand a reasonable prospect of being able to agree and implement a rescue plan with its creditors. With the other safeguards in the Bill, that should give sufficient comfort to the creditors for the duration of the moratorium. If the debentureholder makes it clear to the nominee that the debentureholder, the floating chargeholder, is determined to go ahead and appoint a receiver and assume control of the assets of the company, I do not see how any nominee could have the necessary confidence that the proposal has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para1"></a>In any case, the moratorium will be of a maximum period of 28 days and there are limitations on it being extended. We intend to allow secured creditors&#151;which include the floating chargeholder&#151;to vote for the full amount of their claims on any proposal for an extension of the moratorium beyond that initial period. So they will be able to have their say on whether or not the moratorium should be extended by any period up to a further two months.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para2"></a>If this amendment were to be accepted it could give rise to two conflicting and competing insolvency procedures at the same time; that is, the moratorium and the administrative receivership. In view of what I have said about control of assets, it would effectively wreck the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para3"></a>If any creditor, and that includes a creditor who holds a floating charge, felt that a rescue via a moratorium would not work for some reason, he should express his concerns to the nominee. The purpose of that is to persuade the nominee that he must withdraw his consent to act and so bring the moratorium to an end. Under paragraph 23 of Schedule A1, the nominee is obliged to withdraw his consent to act if he forms the view that the proposed voluntary arrangement does not have a reasonable prospect of being approved or implemented or the company will not have sufficient funds to carry on its business throughout the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para4"></a>The floating chargeholder may, perhaps, make it plain that he fully intends to appoint an administrative receiver the moment the moratorium comes to an end, and that may in itself affect the viability of the voluntary arrangement, which in turn may cause the nominee to withdraw his consent and end the moratorium. However, in the event that the nominee declined to withdraw his consent to act and the floating chargeholder was dissatisfied with that decision, application could still be made to the court under paragraph 24 to challenge that decision. Among other things, the court could bring the moratorium to an end and then the appointment of an administrative receiver could go ahead. We would expect any floating charge holder, who viewed a moratorium as pointless as he fully intends to appoint an administrative receiver, to approach the nominee to make that point. Because of his potential ability to wreck the implementation of an approved voluntary arrangement, it may well be that the nominee will feel the need to approach such chargeholders at an early stage to sound out their views on the proposed rescue attempt.

The Minister was concerned about the destructive effect that accepting my amendment might have on the moratorium; but would that not equally apply to the forfeiture of a lease in the case of a landlord? A landlord is entitled to move in under the forfeiture rules in a manner which would totally destroy the moratorium. So why does he have a special privilege but not the debentureholder?

<a name="00615-23_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 14 I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 82 and 110. We are focusing here on what might be described as a long-standing omission or mistake in the Insolvency Act 1986. I refer to the ability of the landlord to effect peaceable entry during the period of a moratorium. We are very grateful for the discussions <P>


<a name="column_CWH15"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which we had with the Minister on this point following Second Reading. However, we continue to believe that there are insufficient reasons for the Government not to treat peaceable re-entry in exactly the same way as other proceedings. That said, were these amendments accepted they would be inconsistent with similar provisions in the Insolvency Act, and so would not of themselves cure the inconsistency.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para9"></a>We believe that this point must be carefully considered, as we discussed with the Minister. It cannot be ignored. We are therefore particularly interested to hear what the Minister has to say. On that basis we may or may not consider returning to the point on Report. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-23_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   This is clearly a very important matter. We discussed it between the Second Reading and the Committee stage and I acknowledged clearly enough that we take this very seriously indeed. Perhaps I may start by marking the distinction between forfeiture of a lease, a floating charge and an administrative receiver. If a landlord forfeits the lease then the company loses the lease. That may or may not be critical to its ability to do business. Some businesses can continue, particularly in this electronic age, without having a lease. They could retreat to the back bedroom. However, if a floating chargeholder appoints an administrative receiver then the company loses control of all of its assets and there is no possibility of it carrying on or making a rescue attempt.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para10"></a>Having made that distinction between the debentureholder and the landlord, we recognise the importance that this issue may have in determining whether or not a successful rescue is achieved. We can understand the need to bring forward these amendments and we are grateful to have the opportunity to debate them. There are, of course, implications for bankruptcy cases as well. This is potentially a very complex and controversial area, which needs careful consideration before we legislate. That is why we did not put it into this Bill. This is a very modest Bill about a moratorium rather than a review of the whole of insolvency legislation. It is also why the joint DTI/Treasury review of company rescue mechanisms was specifically asked to consider the area separately&#151;some months ago&#151;which it has done done.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para11"></a>It could be argued that there is no need to legislate to prevent landlords from effecting peaceable re-entry as steps can be taken to prevent that happening. For example, a landlord cannot effect peaceable re-entry if there is someone present at the premises at the time who opposes the re-entry. However, that may well involve incurring costs the company can ill afford. Additionally, a landlord who wishes to forfeit a lease by way of peaceable re-entry, other than for arrears of rent, must issue a notice under Section 146 of the Law of Property Act. A tenant then has the right to apply to the court for relief from forfeiture. As we understand it, relief is usually granted where the breaches are capable of remedy within a reasonable period.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH16"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para12"></a>However, that could also involve costs that the company cannot afford. Forfeiture is not a means of recovering outstanding rent but a longstanding right designed to allow a landlord to protect his interests in the property where there has been some act or omission on the part of the tenant. Furtermore, while other creditors can decline to offer further credit during a moratorium, if a landlord is unable to exercise his right to forfeiture where rent is not forthcoming he becomes an unwilling and involuntary creditor&#151;though clearly he would not be alone in that respect. For instance, owners of leased assets are currently unable to take action under their agreements without the leave of the court while a moratorium is in existence.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para13"></a>However, we recognise that, where exercised, this self-help remedy can deprive a company of its trading premises and, in certain circumstances, wreck its business. Consultation on this particular matter is, however, important. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, in her comments on consultation at Second Reading, suggests that she recognises that. Since Second Reading, therefore, we have put in hand a brief consultation on the point. We have requested views on the proposals that landlords should not be able to effect peaceable entry without consent or the leave of the court, while a company or individual is subject to a statutory moratorium in the context of an insolvency procedure.
<P>

<a name="00615-23_para14"></a>The closing date for responses to this brief consultation process is 7th July. We intend that the matter will be determined in the context of the passage of this Bill through Parliament. By this I mean that it is unlikely to be in this House but we will reach a conclusion on it before the Bill leaves another place. I hope that will reassure the Opposition that we have taken seriously the views that were expressed at Second Reading and that this amendment would not be appropriate at this stage.

It is a complex and controversial issue which deserves serious consideration. We take a number of the points that he has made&#151;particularly, for example, in relation to costs that would probably be incurred by landlords&#151;and obviously want to read with great care what the Minister had to say.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-24_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: The concept of a floating charge, as I have been calling it&#151;a debenture as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has been calling it&#151;is well known in this country, particularly to those who have needed to obtain financial support for their companies. Indeed, it is worse than that. Having run my own company for 30 years I am very familiar with the floating charge and, indeed, very familiar with personal guarantees, which go much further than the floating charge.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para5"></a>As the name suggests, the floating charge is a form of security which does not attach to a particular asset. It covers, like the Sword of Damocles, assets not subject to a fixed charge. Generally, it attaches itself only to those assets, or "crystallises", as it is usually called, when some specific event or events occur. What these events are is usually set out in the legal documents creating the charge. A consequence&#151;and a very desirable one at that&#151;of the charge floating is that the company is free to deal with the assets without constantly having to refer back to the chargeholder.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para6"></a>However, on Second Reading I referred to our concern that without this amendment the stay of creditors' rights contained in the Bill would not be fully effective against possible action by the holder of a floating charge. The intention is that we have an effective stay on creditors' rights and so give the company the breathing space it needs to put its rescue plan to creditors. We have therefore brought forward this amendment so as to prevent a floating charge from crystallising, or restrictions being imposed upon the company's ability to dispose of charged property during a moratorium. This leaves the company able to deal with its assets during the moratorium in the same way as it could before the moratorium was obtained. That is because if we permitted either of those events to occur during a moratorium it would be likely to result in a virtual paralysis for the company. To dispose of any goods covered by the charge if either of those events had occurred would need the consent of <P>


<a name="column_CWH18"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the chargeholder or the permission of the court under paragraph 19. That clearly would be impractical in a trading situation and make any rescue attempt very difficult to achieve, if not an impossibility.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para7"></a>However, we have also provided that the charge may crystallise, or restrictions be imposed on the disposal of assets, once the moratorium ends&#151;if that is what the floating chargeholder wishes. The reason is that the secured creditor's rights are only stayed during a moratorium and they should be reinstated as soon as the moratorium ends. That will be achieved by the chargeholder issuing a notice to that effect once a moratorium has come to an end. That will mean that the floating chargeholder will still be able to rely on an event which occurred during the moratorium, so as to crystallise their charge or impose restrictions. Without such a provision, in certain circumstances such an opportunity might otherwise be lost&#151;for example, where crystallisation is to be based on an event which cannot be repeated, such as the resignation of a specific individual.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para8"></a>This approach is consistent with the impact of a moratorium on the treatment of other creditors who are generally prohibited from taking action against the company&#151;other than with the leave of the court&#151;for the period that a moratorium is in force, and whose rights are restored once a moratorium ends, subject to their not being bound by an approved voluntary arrangement. A stay on creditors' rights is fundamental. Without it, the directors will not have the necessary short breathing space within which to put the rescue plan to creditors.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-24_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: Paragraph 13 of the new Schedule A1 provides that any security granted during the period of the moratorium can be enforced only if, at the time it was granted, there were reasonable grounds for believing that it would benefit the company. That provision will make it extremely <P>


<a name="column_CWH19"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH19</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficult to raise finance during the moratorium. Its validity would depend on whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that the security would benefit the company, and that is too demanding a criterion.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para13"></a>Instead, we suggest that the Bill imitates the provisions of Section 245 of the 1986 Act, which avoids floating charges created within a specified period before a company goes into liquidation. Such charges are invalid, save with respect to fresh money or the value of new goods and services provided after the security was granted. That test would, in our view, be a workable one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I would like to speak to Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 which stand in my name. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has already explained, there are concerns, which I share, about the ability to raise finance during the period of the moratorium, were paragraph 13 to remain unamended.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para14"></a>Amendment No. 19 effectively creates some sort of safe haven, albeit a small one, for a funder who acts in good faith in dealing with the nominee who, in his opinion, is taking the right action in accepting the security.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para15"></a>Amendment No. 20 seeks to clarify the issue but, of course, it is difficult, even in my judgment, for security to benefit an entity; it is the transaction which gives rise to the granting of security that should be the test in terms of benefiting the entity.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para16"></a>For the reasons outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the paragraph does need amendment. My own view is that it could be simply amended as I have set out in these proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I propose to speak to the three amendments together. I apologise for not having grouped them together when we first sent out the groupings list yesterday.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para17"></a>We can see that Amendment No. 18 would guarantee the enforceability of a charge taken where new moneys are advanced or goods or services are supplied on credit during a moratorium; that is clearly its intention. It is possible, however, that giving security for an existing debt may be necessary in order to, say, secure future essential supplies during the moratorium. This would not be covered by the amendment, but it would be for the benefit of the company.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para18"></a>The amendment would not ensure that the security could only be enforceable if there were reasonable grounds for believing&#151;at the time the security was taken&#151;that it would benefit the company. I remind the Committee that the phrase "for the benefit of the company"&#151;I am not sure whether the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Kingsland, thinks that it is not clear enough or not important enough, but in any case he does not think it is sufficient&#151;is absolutely critical to this part of the Bill. This pre-condition of benefit is essential. The position of the company's other creditors should not be prejudiced by the company giving new security over its assets to a supplier of new credit where no benefit will flow, as it is likely to reduce the amount of money available for them all. If a plausible case were put to a bank for credit and the directors went off on holiday with the money, clearly that is not an acceptable use of the moratorium, and the other creditors would have a right to feel aggrieved.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para19"></a>The company's "free" assets, which would be available to pay its unsecured creditors, may be depleted to no advantage. And that is why we have provided that security can only be enforced if there were reasonable grounds, when it was granted, for believing that it would benefit the company. We appreciate that this throws the onus on the creditor to satisfy himself, before taking security, that he will be able to enforce it if it is necessary to do so. But this should ensure the desired effect as no one is likely to lend on the basis of security unless there is a clear benefit to the company.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para20"></a>We can also see how this amendment might enable the company to obtain funding during a moratorium. But in certain instances we do not consider that what is proposed would be appropriate, for the reasons I have given, as equity to the other creditors. We consider it vital that security should only be enforceable where a benefit would flow to the company. We remain of the view that we need to consult fully on the issue of funding before we can find an effective solution to this complex and difficult problem. We should not overlook the fact that before entering the moratorium the nominee would need to have given his opinion that the company is likely to have sufficient funds to enable it to carry on its business during the short moratorium period.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para21"></a>As for Amendments No. 19 and 20, we consider it appropriate that the onus should be on a potential lender to satisfy himself, before he takes new security from a company during a moratorium, that he will be able to enforce it if necessary. By placing the onus on the creditor this should produce the desired effect as no one is likely to lend on the basis of security unless there is a clear benefit to the company; in effect, as if he had read the Bill or the rules which will be publicised if and when the Bill is enacted.
<P>

<a name="00615-24_para22"></a>We consider it undesirable for the nominee to be involved, particularly as, no doubt, lenders would want to satisfy themselves that their security will be enforceable if they need to take action to recover their debt by realising their security. We see that the granting of the security and the transaction leading to it is inextricably linked, so there is no real need to distinguish between the two as the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, suggested. Thus, alas, we are not able to accept these amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3>in so far as these things can be specific and measurable, they are unlikely to lead to an excess of ex post litigation.

("and for the purposes of this paragraph, "hire purchase agreement" shall not include conditional sale agreements, chattel leasing agreements or retention of title agreements").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-25_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: As I speak to move this amendment standing in my name, it is to help me understand what I saw as a potential conflict between the definitions of what constituted a hire purchase agreement. By virtue of paragraph 1 of Schedule A1 a retention of title clause comes within the definition of a hire purchase agreement. In paragraph 16(2)(a) we also refer to a hire purchase agreement, or a conditional sale agreement. However, the hire purchase agreement is defined in paragraph 1 as including a condition of sale agreement as well as a chattel leasing agreement and retention of title agreement. It is not clear to me whether paragraph 16(2)(a) is intended to encompass the latter two types of agreement. If it is then I believe it needs to be specific, and if it is not then perhaps some further clarification would be useful. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think I can answer the question simply. The current wording in paragraph 16 follows that used in the corresponding provision in Section 360 of the Insolvency Act 1986, with an extended definition of hire purchase agreement to include conditional sale agreements, chattel leasing agreements and retention of title agreements. The extended definition of hire purchase is to be found in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1A, and of course is the same as that which the noble Lord uses in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para5"></a>The offence of obtaining credit in paragraph 16 is explicitly extended by paragraph 16(2) to include,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where goods are bailed (in Scotland, hired) ... or ... agreed to be sold"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-25_para6"></a>
under the two types of agreement specifically referred to; namely, hire purchase for goods being bailed and conditional sale agreements for goods agreed to be sold. As it is not generally apt to refer to bailment in the context of a conditional sale agreement, it is necessary to make separate reference to the circumstances in which the goods are agreed to be sold under this type of agreement in order that this provision will have the effect we intend. Moreover, goods supplied under a chattel leasing or retention of title agreement will not be caught by paragraph <P>


<a name="column_CWH22"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH22</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>16(2)(a) for the same reason. The paragraph as drafted is beastly complicated but it is necessary to ensure that prosecution can be undertaken in appropriate circumstances.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para7"></a>Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, will allow me, while I am still in the mode of hire-purchase agreements, to say something about his Amendment No. 23 which I know he has not yet moved but which concerns the same issue.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para8"></a>A company that has entered a moratorium may have goods that are subject to hire-purchase, conditional sale, chattel leasing or retention of title agreements. Under paragraph 19, during the moratorium the company is able to deal with these goods within the terms of the relevant agreements because the company is, of course, carrying on business as usual. Paragraph 19 also provides that a company may dispose of goods, which are the subject of such agreements, provided certain conditions are first satisfied.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para9"></a>If we agree to Amendment No. 23 it would mean that the company's ability to dispose of goods under conditional sale, chattel leasing or retention of title agreements would be restricted to the company's ability to dispose of them under the terms of the relevant agreements. This would be, in our view, unduly restrictive, as the company may need to dispose of such goods in order to raise funds or reduce overheads. It might be a perfectly proper business decision. However, the rights of the holder of security, or the owner, as the case may be, are protected by sub-paragraphs (4) and (6).
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para10"></a>I hope that that anticipates the arguments that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, was going to use about Amendment No. 23 and I hope that what I have said about Amendment No. 21 will persuade him that our view is correct.

("(4) A disposal of the company's property to any person other than a person who is connected with the company shall not be avoided only on the ground that sub-paragraph (1)(a) was not satisfied, but any officer of the company who authorises or permitted the contravention, without reasonable excuse, is liable to indemnify the company for any loss or damage resulting from the disposal.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-25_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: Paragraph 17 of the new Schedule A1 restricts a company from disposing of its property unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the disposal would benefit the company and the disposal is approved by the moratorium committee or, where there is no such committee, by the nominee. It is not clear whether or not any such <P>


<a name="column_CWH23"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disposal is avoided if it should turn out that the grounds for believing that the disposal would benefit the company were not reasonable.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para14"></a>That must be clarified, we believe, because it is not acceptable for any disposal to someone who is not connected with the company to be avoided at a subsequent date. That would have a substantial effect on the price to be paid. Both the company and the purchaser would be prejudiced. The company would get a lower price for its property and the purchaser would obtain property which might subsequently be claimed back by the company. That would be particularly unacceptable for any purchaser because such a purchaser should not be put on enquiry as to the grounds for the belief that the disposal would benefit the company, particularly if approved by the moratorium committee or the nominee.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para15"></a>The point is that, as the Bill is currently drafted, when forming an agreement with a third party and entering into a contract with him where there has been a moratorium, the contract is going to be of dubious validity, unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that their disposal would benefit the company. What sort of a contractual restriction is that? Why should a third party be interested in or concerned with whether the transaction is going to be for the benefit of the company? We do not believe that this is realistic. Moreover, if there is a risk of the contract being avoided, why would a person enter into it in the first place? He would surely go elsewhere.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope the noble Baroness will forgive me on the basis that I am going to make a friendly response to the amendment. We recognise the concern that if disposal were made contrary to paragraph 17 of Schedule A1, they could be invalid and unenforceable. We have concluded that this is right. We see that it would be damaging to rescue attempts if third parties were reluctant to deal with a company which is in a moratorium because of doubts about whether the contract would be enforceable against the company. We agree that this issue must be addressed in the Bill. Unfortunately, the amendment does not fully achieve what is required.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para16"></a>The amendment also seeks to make officers liable to indemnify the company for any loss or damage they cause to it by permitting, or authorising, a disposal which is contrary to paragraph 17 of Schedule A1. Paragraph 38 of Schedule A1 provides that the court can make such order as it thinks fit when the actions of the directors are challenged. Such an order may require a director to indemnify the company where it <P>


<a name="column_CWH24"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had suffered a loss because he had caused the company to make a prohibited disposal. The Bill already deals with that particular point.
<P>

<a name="00615-25_para17"></a>The amendment would still leave a third party needing to satisfy himself as to whether the proposed transaction is in the ordinary course of the company's business, and if not, whether the appropriate consent has been obtained from the nominee or committee under paragraph 17(1)(b). These difficulties may still make third parties wary of dealing with the company. In my view the proposed Amendment No. 22 would not fully deal with the issue which concerns us all regarding the effect of paragraph 17 on third parties. However, we will be bringing forward amendments as soon as we can&#151;and I am not promising that it will be at Report stage&#151;to make it clear that contracts entered into in breach of paragraph 17 will be enforceable by third parties against the company.

He has to believe that the proposed voluntary arrangement has a reasonable prospect of being approved or implemented; and that the company will have sufficient funds available to it during the remainder of the moratorium to enable it to carry on business. If he does not hold that opinion he must withdraw his consent to act in accordance with paragraph 23.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para4"></a>Paragraph 22(3) provides that, in forming his opinion, he is entitled to rely on the information submitted to him by the directors under sub-paragraph (2),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless he has reason to doubt its accuracy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-26_para5"></a>
This provision is similar to the provision in paragraph 6(3).
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para6"></a>In our view, during the course of the moratorium a nominee should be under a duty to verify the information submitted to him by the directors from independent sources. When a company's financial affairs are so parlous that a moratorium is appropriate the directors are often desperate enough, no doubt frequently innocently, to mislead a nominee. We believe it is unreasonable for a nominee to rely upon the judgment of directors during the course of a moratorium; although at the beginning of the process there appears to be no alternative to this course.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para7"></a>We do not believe that, during the course of the moratorium, the nominee should only rely on the information submitted to him by the directors. He must obtain some cross co-ordinates. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is entirely right. We intend that during a <P>


<a name="column_CWH25"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moratorium the nominee should be entitled to rely on the information given to him by the directors, for monitoring purposes, unless he has reason to doubt its accuracy. There is a very good reason for that. If the nominee had to establish and/or verify the information for himself the process would be likely to be prohibitively expensive. These additional costs would probably deny those companies which need the new moratorium the most the opportunity to use it. If that were so, this would undermine our purpose in legislating in this area.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para8"></a>However, the Bill does address the concerns which lie behind this amendment. First, we have provided, under paragraph 23(2)(c) of Schedule A1, that the nominee must withdraw his consent to act and so end the moratorium if the directors do not supply the necessary information required of them under paragraph 22. Also, supplying incorrect information would mean that the directors have not complied with that obligation and on becoming aware of that fact the nominee would have to withdraw in that instance too.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para9"></a>Secondly, depending on the circumstances, a director may also have committed an offence contrary to paragraph 40 of the schedule if he fails to provide the nominee with the requisite information or submits incorrect information. We consider that that should discourage any misconduct in this area by rogue directors who hope to prevent a nominee from ending a moratorium by providing misleading information.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para10"></a>We therefore consider it essential that paragraph 22(3) of Schedule A1 is retained, rather than removed as proposed by the amendment. We also consider that adequate safeguards are in place to deal with the concerns which have led to this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am partially reassured by what he has said and will look again at the amendment to see whether or not there is another way to put the point. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-26_para12"></a><P>

<a name="00615-26_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 27, 29 and 34, which are grouped with it.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para14"></a>All of these amendments deal with the situation in which the nominee ceases to act or may be required to cease to act. Amendment No. 26 changes the obligation on the nominee from a mandatory obligation to an optional one. Given that the purpose is to create a relatively short moratorium, which should&#151;as the Minister has already said&#151;be flexible, it would be beneficial to give the nominee, who after all would be someone experienced in these matters, the flexibility, rather than the obligation to withdraw in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para15"></a>Amendment No. 27 also deals with the circumstances in which the nominee must or may withdraw his or her consent to act. It adds to the clause the obligation that the opinion on which that decision <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>might be founded should be a reasonable one. Circumstances could be envisaged in which it would be unreasonable for somebody to state a particular opinion in these circumstances and the requirement that it should be based on reason is necessary.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para16"></a>Amendment No 29 deals with the circumstances in which a nominee may wish to withdraw his consent to act, which fall outside the terms as set out currently in paragraph 23. Paragraph 23 provides for very specific circumstances in which a nominee may withdraw his or her consent to act. It would be good to have an all-encompassing provision, where the nominee could apply to the court for reasons based on circumstances that fall outside those relatively narrow definitions. Amendment No. 29 seeks to do just that.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para17"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 34 extends the remit in paragraph 26 of Schedule 1 to allow, by the application of a creditor, for the replacement of a nominee who has failed to carry out any of his or her duties. I will return to the issue of the fundamental duty of the nominee later in our discussions. However, on Second Reading I made the point that I was concerned that there needed to be an understanding of where the duty of the nominee fundamentally lies. Is it a care to the creditors, to the court, to the company, or to the directors? I believe it is necessary that the creditors should have the right to apply for the removal of a nominee who has failed to comply with the duties imposed on him in this Schedule. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I shall deal with each of these amendments in turn. To accept Amendment No. 26 would give the nominee discretion to withdraw his consent to act, rather than being obliged to do so.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para18"></a>If it becomes clear that the voluntary arrangement is unlikely to be approved and implemented, the moratorium should be brought to an end. If no rescue is in prospect we consider that the company should not have the protection afforded by a moratorium and so the nominee must withdraw his consent to act.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para19"></a>Similarly, we consider that the nominee should have no option but to withdraw his consent to act if he becomes aware that when the company filed for a moratorium it was ineligible to do so. A company should not have the continuing benefit of a moratorium if it was not entitled to the moratorium in the first place.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para20"></a>Similarly, again, if the directors do not provide the information the nominee requests, so that he can monitor the company's affairs during the moratorium, we consider he must also be required to withdraw his consent to act. Monitoring is an important safeguard in the moratorium period. If the nominee cannot monitor the company's affairs as he thinks fit the company should not continue to have the benefit of the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para21"></a>The circumstances set out in paragraph 23(2) requiring a nominee to withdraw are such that he should have no option but to withdraw if he forms the opinion that one or more of them applies. We <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore do not consider the nominee should have the discretion to remain in office under these circumstances and we cannot support this amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para22"></a>Amendment No. 27 would require that the nominee must only withdraw his consent if he forms the reasonable opinion that, first, the proposed voluntary arrangement no longer has a reasonable prospect of being approved or implemented or, secondly, the company will not have sufficient funds available to it during the moratorium to enable it to continue in business.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para23"></a>We agree that where the nominee does form an opinion under paragraph 23(2) it should be reasonably held. However, inserting the additional requirement that his opinion should be reasonable is not necessary in this paragraph. If the nominee acts unreasonably then his decision can be challenged by an application to the court under paragraph 24. It follows therefore that, where challenged, if a nominee withdrew his consent to act under paragraph 23 on the basis of an unreasonable opinion the court can make an appropriate order which would provide the remedy which I think the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is seeking.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para24"></a>It seemed to be suggested that there is a conflict of roles for the nominee during a moratorium&#151;that of an independent office holder with a duty to the general body of creditors and that of a professional adviser with a duty of care to his client. We do not see any conflict of role for the nominee. His role is set out in the Bill and that role determines his duties and responsibilities. He has functions to fulfil under Schedule A1. For example, before a company can obtain a moratorium he is required to express his opinion on various matters. He will either consider that he can make the required statement set out in paragraph 6, or not. In certain instances he is required to give notice to various individuals and in other instances he is required to approve certain transactions which the company may only enter into if they satisfy certain requirements. He will either be content that they satisfy those requirements, or he will not. He has to monitor the company's affairs so that, if the circumstances require, he will withdraw his consent to act and bring the moratorium to an end.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para25"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 29, this amendment seeks to give the nominee an ability to withdraw his consent to act&#151;thus bringing the moratorium to an end&#151;by way of obtaining leave from the court. But the Bill already provides enough flexibility to enable him to withdraw his consent where appropriate. We have provided that he must withdraw his consent to act at any time during a moratorium, if he forms the opinion, which I have already set out in my response to the earlier amendment, that the voluntary arrangement, as proposed or with modifications no longer has a reasonable prospect of being approved or implemented, or that the company will not have sufficient funds available to it to enable it to continue to carry on its business during the remainder of the moratorium.
<P>

<P>

<a name="00615-26_para26"></a>He must also withdraw his consent to act if he becomes aware that when the company filed for a moratorium it was ineligible to do so, or if the directors fail to provide him with the necessary information.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para27"></a>One or other of these grounds would provide for the nominee to withdraw his consent in any appropriate circumstances and that would bring the moratorium to an end. These are decisions for the nominee and not for the court and we would not wish to provide further that the nominee could withdraw his consent to act with the leave of the court. I believe case law shows that if a nominee went along to the court in those circumstances the court would be likely to say "It is nothing to do with us, go back and do your job". Under those circumstances, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, not to press this amendment.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para28"></a>On Amendment No. 34, in our view it would be inappropriate to extend the scope of paragraph 26 to allow creditors to apply to the court to replace a nominee. A creditor who is not satisfied with the conduct of a nominee can already apply to the court under paragraph 24 and the court can make any order it thinks fit to deal with the situation complained of.
<P>

<a name="00615-26_para29"></a>Alternatively, the replacement of the existing nominee by another nominee could be made a condition of any extension of the moratorium under paragraph 31, or approval of a voluntary arrangement under paragraph 29. We think nothing further is needed.

I should like to read it carefully in Hansard and reflect upon it, but I do see a fundamental difference of view between us. That is the difference between an individual having a number of different roles and an individual having a different duty of care. In many cases one can carry out different roles, but one's duty of care very frequently can become conflicted if it is to more than two or three people.

<FONT SIZE=3>well be there to supervise a moratorium for a limited period of time, but it will be found to be almost impossible to attract professionals into this function unless there is a clear definition of the duty of care.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 30 and, with it, Amendments Nos. 31 and 32. We are in considerable agreement with regard to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman&#151;to the extent that we agree that the nominee should be able to apply to the court for directions in respect of any matter arising in connection with the performance by him of his functions. However, we do not agree to the extent that the noble Lord seeks to remove lines 36 to 48. It is our view that a creditor would then be unable to challenge the nominee's decision. We cannot believe that that is the noble Lord's intention. It would be unrealistic for creditors to be allowed the right to challenge the decision of the nominee. There is common ground between us and we should be happy if Amendment No. 31 were accepted. However, the removal of lines 36 to 48 would present a problem. The nominee should have the right to ask the court for directions. This jurisdiction has always been given to office-holders in the position of the nominee. The original right was that of a trustee to apply to the court for directions, and that right has been given to all office-holders who do not act in self-interest, or similar office-holders.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para5"></a>We cannot support the noble Lord's second amendment on this point, Amendment No. 32. It seeks to remove a further right from the creditor; namely, the right of the creditor, and others, to take proceedings against the nominee. Would that have the effect of granting immunity to nominees&#151;many of whom are likely to be accountants?

<P>
<A NAME="00615-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Amendments Nos. 30 and 32 are "ferocious" amendments which would remove from creditors a considerable element of the protection which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has rightly pointed out, is carefully provided for in this part of the schedule.

<P>

<a name="00615-27_para11"></a>I repeat the warning that I gave about applications to the court. Courts are quite unlikely to entertain such applications and Mr Justice Neuberger in a recent case expressed the view that the courts should not be used by the administrator in relation to an administration order as a way of avoiding commercial and administrative decisions which are properly for him, and to enable him to obtain the court's endorsement of his intended course of action. The judge said that the court was not there to act as a bomb shelter for the administrator. The case was T&D Industries plc v Another&#151;and, as he is nodding, it seems that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, knows the case.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para12"></a>I do not believe that the duty of care issue is as the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, described it. There is only one possible successful outcome of a moratorium, and that is an agreed voluntary arrangement. That cannot be achieved without a duty of care to all the parties; they all have to accept that the voluntary arrangement is agreed to. However, these "ferocious" amendments would remove the important safeguards provided by paragraphs 24 and 25 for those affected by a moratorium which enable interested parties to challenge a nominee's actions. They are replaced with a provision that the nominee may apply to the court for directions in respect of any matter arising in connection with the performance by him of his functions. That provides no safeguard for interested parties, but offers a nominee the means to seek directions from the court, which, as I have indicated, is unlikely to be successful. The nominee should be accountable for his actions; that is why we need paragraphs 24 and 25.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para13"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 31. We do not consider that the nominee should be given the power to apply to the court for directions, for exactly the reason I gave in response to other amendments. The nominee's role in the moratorium is such that he should not be in a position where such an application is appropriate. We must not lose sight of the fact that the nominee will not have any of the company's assets in his possession nor will he be running its affairs.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para14"></a>Commercial and administrative decisions are for the nominee, not for the court. We do not consider that the courts should be used to provide the nominee with a way to avoid taking decisions which are rightly for him and to enable him to obtain the court's endorsement of his intended course of action. That is what I believe Mr Justice Neuberger was saying.

<a name="00615-27_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: Paragraph 25 of new Schedule A1 gives the creditor the right to apply to the court where the company has suffered loss as the result of some act or omission of the nominee. On such application, the court can authorise the creditor to pursue a claim in the name of the company. In our view, the court should have power to direct the company to fund the creditor in bringing the claim.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para19"></a>In essence, where the company has suffered loss as a result of an act, omission or decision of the nominee, and where the company has no intention of pursuing a claim it may have against the nominee, we believe that not only, as the Bill provides, should the creditor be able to apply to the court for authorisation to pursue a claim and direct the company to assist in the pursuit of a claim; we believe it only reasonable, only equitable, that the company should fund that claim.
<P>

<a name="00615-27_para20"></a>That approach is in accordance with numerous decisions, including, for example, Wallesteiner v Moir and subsequent cases. Where a minority shareholder wishes to bring a minority shareholder's action in the name of a company, he can apply for an indemnity against the costs of that action. We feel that a similar opportunity should be provided here; otherwise, the creditor is paying for litigation for the benefit of the company&#151;in which case, the Bill as drafted discourages any such creditor. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness. The amendment indicates a concern that the court may not be able to order the company to fund a claim where it authorises&#151;as it can do under 25(3)&#151;a creditor to pursue a claim against a nominee under that paragraph. Paragraph 25(4) gives examples of matters which may be covered by an order made under sub-paragraph (3). It is clear from the words "among other things" in sub-paragraph (4) that matters which may be covered by such an order are not limited to those set out in sub-paragraph (4). Therefore, if the court thought it appropriate to order the company to fund pursuit, by a creditor, of the company's claim against the nominee, it could do so without the further words being added.

<a name="00615-28_para7"></a>Subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 4 create a new type of insolvency practitioner who can act as a nominee or supervisor of a voluntary arrangement. Subsection (4) envisages such a person being authorised by a body recognised by the Secretary of State satisfying certain security requirements and not being ineligible on certain, specified grounds. These persons need not be insolvency practitioners.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para8"></a>As we said at Second Reading, that is worrying because it is inherently likely that an authorised person will be someone who has not made it as an insolvency practitioner and who has therefore become an authorised person instead. There would be no need for him to be an authorised person if he were already an insolvency practitioner. The result would be that an authorised person could in practice be less able than an insolvency practitioner.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para9"></a>This is particularly dangerous because of the new procedure for a moratorium, which cuts out the role of the court. Under existing law, a company can obtain a moratorium if it petitions the court for an administration order. The petition is usually heard within five days. The court can then continue the moratorium by making an administration order. An individual can obtain a moratorium if an interim order is granted by the court. The court is, therefore, closely involved at a very early stage. This is an important safeguard, since a moratorium imposes extreme restrictions on creditors, so the courts police these moratoria carefully.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para10"></a>The Bill as currently drafted will get rid of this important safeguard. A company or individual will be able to obtain a moratorium without any involvement by a court. To allow mere authorised persons, who may not be insolvency practitioners, to be the only real safeguard is unacceptable.

<P>

<a name="00615-28_para11"></a>In discussions with the Minister, following Second Reading, he made quite clear that the Government see no reason for standards to drop. However, I believe we should reflect upon the fact that, thanks to the Insolvency Act 1986, standards for insolvency practitioners have risen. We see the introduction of this new animal, this new style authorised person if you like, as a dumbing down of those standards. At the moment to be an insolvency practitioner and have a licence one must pass exams and have experience, and one is regularly policed by the joint monetary unit inspectors, with the threat always hanging over one of disciplinary tribunals and fines.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para12"></a>It is our belief that a further important point must also be taken into account with regard to these amendments. These authorised persons will only be able to handle a voluntary arrangement. It is our belief that they will inevitably recommend a voluntary arrangement, because otherwise if they recommend, for example, a bankruptcy in practice they will not be able to act and so they will not receive a fee.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para13"></a>Perhaps I may offer an example. Take someone who is in considerable debt and has no assets. He goes to a "new style" insolvency practitioner, an authorised person, who then will draft a voluntary arrangement proposal. He is bound to get it through the practice. Creditors would be paid, say 10 pence in the pound over the next five years. The fees of the insolvency practitioner for this would be, for example, &#163;5,000. If the individual went bankrupt he would be much better off, but then, of course, the authorised person would not receive his fee.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para14"></a>As we speak, bankruptcy registrars who police the situation are trying to stop this practice. If we have individuals who are only licensed to handle a voluntary arrangement then this is bound to happen. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendments No. 98 and 99 which stand in my name and are grouped with this amendment. I agree with the noble Baroness about the enabling aspects of this legislation. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that enabling provisions are contained in this Bill, and that we should wait and see.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para15"></a>There are two conflicts here. First, it is my judgment that the process by which a moratorium may be selected will inevitably be dominated by insolvency practitioners. I cannot envisage circumstances in which the directors of a company, with the duty of care they have to their shareholders and the provisions for failing or becoming insolvent, would think it sensible to take advice from anybody other than a practitioner in insolvency. It may be difficult to see this group of persons, whomever they may be, emerging. Nevertheless, if it is desirable that this enabling provision be included in the Bill then the body so recognised must have proper ethical standards, proper training and so on.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 seek to add the words "regulated professional" to the clause so that we are talking about "regulated professional bodies". That would require that any body falling into that category <P>


<a name="column_CWH34"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was subject to regulations, proper rules of ethics, and appropriate training and development for the task they would be carrying out. That would be a sensible provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-28_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   I hope that I may speak to Amendments Nos. 96 and 97, although we are straying into Clause 4. I have some sympathy with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, although this is not a subject on which I have had any expertise, or even familiarity, up to now, except in the context of Third World insolvency, in which the Minister also has a special responsibility. By chance I have been in conversation with a friend who is an insolvency practitioner who has privately expressed concerns about this Bill to me. I decided they were important enough to bring them before the Committee. I know from reading the documents that all noble Lords are aware of these in general, but I will not repeat them in detail since they were aired at Second Reading. As we have heard, they enabled the Secretary of State to recognise bodies and to authorise persons to act as nominees or supervisors not otherwise authorised to act.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para17"></a>I know enough about the professional status of other professions to be genuinely surprised by this clause, which appears to threaten the integrity of a highly respected profession in which much public confidence is vested. We have seen, for example, that the proposed nominees, albeit on a temporary basis, would not just be acting as practitioners but be defined as such, although evidently not qualified to make judgments on other kinds of insolvency procedure. This is where I support the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and I understand that it lies at the heart of concerns among the practitioners as well as their professional body, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. They argue that there is a clear risk that these acting practitioners will tend to recommend the voluntary arrangements where another process might be more appropriate. This could alter the whole direction of an insolvency procedure.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para18"></a>I know the Minister sought to answer this point during the Second Reading debate. He suggested (at col. 1271 of the Official Report of 4th April 2000) that the ABRP has already allowed some of its members to qualify through business rescue experience, but he will know that such company reconstruction work is carried out outside the formal procedures whereas in this case we are talking about formally appointed practitioners.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para19"></a>The Minister admitted that he did not know how this new role would work out and that the Government were in no hurry to implement the measure; so why is it necessary? Are there not enough fully qualified professionals? Will this clause not give the public and the profession a sense of unease and uncertainty about the value and status of the insolvency practitioners and even about their credibility.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para20"></a>I understand the profession as a whole supports the general direction of the Bill, but this clause causes professionals, such as my friend, much concern and I would like to pass the Minister's comments and assurances to him.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para21"></a>I am also interested to know whether the Minister has considered the question of a name for the new type of practitioner should this clause remain in the Bill as there is likely to be much confusion about it.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para22"></a>Finally, I also support the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in his amendment to the new section, which requires the nominee to be a member of a body recognised.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para23"></a>It clearly follows from what I have already said that this needs to be a professional body and that the wording should at least be in line with Section 390(2) of the Insolvency Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am glad to have had the opportunity to listen to this useful debate. At present, only licensed insolvency practitioners may act as nominees and supervisors of voluntary arrangements. I have no hesitation in acknowledging that their skills, education, training and experience make them particularly suited for this and I have no doubt they will continue to undertake these roles.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para24"></a>However, that is not to say that there is, or could be, no other body whose members might also be capable of acting as nominees or supervisors or that such a body might not emerge in the future. That is particularly true in relation to the new moratorium.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para25"></a>We are not alone in recognising that. The insolvency practitioners have already recognised that people other themselves might have relevant skills. The trade association, formally the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, is now called the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. Membership of that body is open to others with expertise in financial rescues. Those skills may prove very useful in achieving rescues by way of voluntary arrangements. If a body exists or is formed whose members are capable of acting as nominees and supervisors we see no good reason why its members should be prevented from playing a part in the rescue process, and that is why the power to recognise such a body was included in the Bill. Put another way, it is not essential that a nominee or supervisor need have the skills of an "undertaker" which is the way of commonly characterising an insolvency practitioner, as well as those of a "doctor"; he only needs those of the "doctor" to achieve the rescue.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para26"></a>It is clear that the Secretary of State would only recognise bodies which have in place suitable regimes to ensure that their members are up to the required standards. That regime will, of course, include suitable provision for recognition and measurement of skills, education and training, experience and so on. I do not see why any nominees or supervisors who could have been authorised in this clause should be thought to be "not up to the mark", as the noble Baroness, Lady <P>


<a name="column_CWH36"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Buscombe said, just because they do not choose to become insolvency practitioners but choose to specialise as doctors rather than undertakers.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para27"></a>We should not ignore the fact that some voluntary arrangements never get off the ground because the company or debtor concerned cannot afford the fees of the insolvency practitioner. If these amendments are passed it will prevent people coming into the marketplace who are capable of doing those jobs of nominee and supervisor to a satisfactory standard and perhaps at a lower cost. However, I cannot over-emphasise that the reason for taking this power is to ensure that we can harness skills which, but for Clause 4 in its original and unamended form, would not be available to those attempting a rescue. We see no reason why standards should drop if the Secretary of State is allowed to recognise new bodies under new Section 389A.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para28"></a>From what was said on Second Reading, and here again today, it is clear that noble Lords are content with the Secretary of State's ability to recognise bodies to authorise insolvency practitioners. It will therefore be understood that we are slightly puzzled when it is suggested that the new class of nominee and supervisor will not be up to the mark. For that to be the case, it has to be assumed that the Secretary of State would recognise a body which did not have in place an appropriate regulatory regime meeting the requirements of Clause 4. That will simply not be the case&#151;if a body cannot come up with a suitable regime to ensure that those it would authorise are up to the mark, it will not be recognised under Clause 4.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para29"></a>The regime of a body recognised under Clause 4 may, of course, be different from that of a body recognised under Section 391, since the members of a body recognised under Clause 4 will only be authorised to act as nominees and supervisors and not as insolvency practitioners generally.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para30"></a>I do, however, recognise that a difference between Section 391(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986 and what will be new Section 389A(5) may have caused some of the concern regarding standards. That may have resulted in the two amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, has spoken. Section 391(2) refers to the recognition of a body which "regulates the practice of a profession" whereas new Section 389A(5) does not. But nothing of significance should be lost by that difference.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para31"></a>If it is suggested that the new breed of nominee supervisor would only recognise a voluntary arrangement, I would reply that the recognition of bodies under Section 391 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is only for the purpose of authorising individuals to act as insolvency practitioners, say as the liquidator and administrator of a company, or as a trustee in bankruptcy; or, indeed, as a nominee or supervisor. Thus recognition of a body under Clause 4 is only for the purpose of authorising individuals to act as nominee and supervisor. Neither power purports to regulate the provision of advice to a company or debtor that is in financial difficulties.
<P>

<P>

<a name="00615-28_para32"></a>Such companies and debtors should seek advice from those they consider most suited to give it. That may or may not be an individual authorised by a body recognised under Section 391 or Clause 4. We simply do not accept that this point is valid. We consider that it is important that those who have the skills to achieve a rescue by way of a voluntary arrangement are able to assist companies and debtors in this way. Even the Association of Business Recovery and Professionals recognises that people other than insolvency practitioners already have skills which can usefully be brought to bear in achieving a rescue.
<P>

<a name="00615-28_para33"></a>We consider that the Secretary of State will be able to ensure that recognition is only given to a body under Clause 4, where it can ensure that its members are up to standard and conduct themselves in an appropriate manner. Any concerns about the ability of those authorised by virtue of Clause 4 to do their job properly as nominee or supervisor should be unfounded. If standards are not maintained, the Secretary of State can revoke an order recognising a body under Clause 4. Under those circumstances, we cannot accept these amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response but ask him to clarify a point that I may not have quite right. Is he saying that I am wrong in suggesting that an authorised person is licensed only to handle a voluntary arrangement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   He is licensed only to act as a nominee or supervisor in a moratorium.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   In which case, is he therefore not able to suggest other routes which might in fact be more beneficial to the person who has gone to him? I made the point about the small man who is in debt but would actually be better off going bankrupt than having a voluntary arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   He can do that, of course, and he can give the advice. However, the successful outcome of a moratorium&#151;that is what a moratorium is for&#151;is a way in which the business carries on trading with the agreement of its creditors. The form that takes, whether it is a formal, voluntary arrangement, is open. A failure of a moratorium, however, is where the business goes bust and the creditors decide they would rather the business go bust than that it should be allowed to continue. That must, however, be their judgment and the nominee or supervisor is there to seek to achieve the continuation of the business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. I am still unhappy with regard to the point we have made; namely, that whatever the circumstances the authorised person is almost bound to recommend a voluntary arrangement even where other procedures might be more appropriate. Indeed, in a sense I am saying that it is much less expensive. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that directors of the company are not likely to go to an authorised person. I thank him for his support.

<a name="00615-29_para0"></a>However, I return to my example of the individual, the small man, who is in debt without any assets, and take up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. He is unlikely really to know who he is going to. The point made by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, is very important in that there is some confusion as to the role, and indeed the credibility, of these new authorised persons. They are not just acting as insolvency practitioners but, in a sense, holding themselves out as insolvency practitioners.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think I understand the difficulty we are having. The point being made by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is about pre-moratorium advice: in other words, whether or not we should go into a moratorium. I now understand and I am sorry to have been slow on the uptake. Neither the power under Section 391, which is the insolvency practitioner power, nor the power under Clause 4, purports to regulate the provision of advice to a company or a debtor that is in financial difficulty. That is not restricted to an insolvency practitioner or an authorised person, or anybody.
<P>

<a name="00615-29_para1"></a>Companies or debtors seek advice from the people they consider most suited to give it. That could be their auditors, their bank managers, their brothers-in-law, or whoever it might be. What we are doing is nothing to do with advice before considering whether or not to go to a moratorium. We are looking at the qualifications for being a nominee or supervisor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   We made this point because an authorised person is only able to handle a voluntary arrangement; he is almost liable to recommend a voluntary arrangement. This may be cynical, but it will happen in practice because that is the only way he is going to get paid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   He gets paid as a nominee also, but as a supervisor, of course. If the phrase "voluntary arrangement" is being used as an alternative to "moratorium", anyone can advise on whether a moratorium is a good idea, and both creditors and the company have to agree to it&#151;I stress "anyone", not merely an authorised person or insolvency practitioner. The nominee comes in when a decision has been taken in principle to go for a moratorium and he is paid as the nominee or the supervisor of the moratorium.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. The exchange on this point has been helpful. Again, I shall read the noble Lord's remarks with care.
<P>

<a name="00615-29_para2"></a>I should like to return briefly to the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, in regard to naming the authorised persons. It is important, particularly in relation to the "small guy" who is in difficulty and who needs help, that he should understand clearly, up front, whom he is approaching and what advice they are able to give. I thank the Minister. We shall read with care all that has been said and we may return to this point at Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   Under the Bill as drafted, the meeting can resolve to extend the moratorium. However, the wording does not necessarily have that effect. It is a question of semantics. We do not question the purpose of the clause; both amendments merely propose a drafting point. A meeting can resolve itself to do anything, but that does not necessarily mean that it gives effect to that resolution. We believe that the wording should be the other way round: that the moratorium should be extended if the committee so resolves. The same is true of Amendment No. 39, which states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A committee shall be established if, with the consent of the nominee, a meeting summoned under paragraph 27 resolves that the moratorium be extended ... and resolves that such a committee be established; and such a committee may exercise the functions conferred on it by the meeting".

<A NAME="00615-29_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has taken these two amendments together, because I can give the same happy reassurance on both of them. We are convinced&#151;and we have taken further legal advice on the matter&#151;that the amendments do not change the substance of paragraph 30(1) or paragraph 33(1) in any way. Amendment No. 37 merely re-states the content of paragraph 30(1) in different terms. The meaning of paragraph 30(1) is perfectly clear. It provides that where a meeting of the company or its creditors convened to consider the approval of a proposal for a voluntary arrangement is to be adjourned, the meeting may also resolve to extend, or further extend, the moratorium period, subject to any conditions the meeting may impose.
<P>

<a name="00615-29_para7"></a>Amendment No. 39 relates to paragraph 33(1). The meaning of the paragraph is perfectly clear. It provides that if a meeting of the company or its creditors resolves to extend, or further extend, the moratorium, it may also, with the consent of the nominee and subject to paragraph 33(2), resolve to establish a committee to exercise the functions conferred on it by that meeting. Those seem to us the objectives of the amendment. We are convinced that our wording achieves those objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   We are going to have to agree to disagree at this point. Amendment No. 39 seeks to amend paragraph 33 of New Schedule A1, which merely gives a meeting summoned under paragraph 27 <P>

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="00615-29_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is the meaning of "dissolve"!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   The Oxford Dictionary states that "resolve" means to disintegrate; that is one meaning. I think that I will have to return to this matter at Report stage. However, I press the point that if one resolves to do something that does not give effect to it. It is a great idea; you can resolve to do all sorts of things, but it does not necessarily mean that they will happen. I should have thought the Government intend that the measure should have the effect of summoning a committee.

<P>
<A NAME="00615-29_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness and I have no doubt spent far too much of our lives in committees.

<FONT SIZE=3>afraid to start to implement the voluntary arrangement because a member of the company may apply to the court in instances where the decision of the creditors and company meetings are at variance. However, supervisors should not be hesitant about implementing voluntary arrangements in these circumstances.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para3"></a>Paragraph 34 of Schedule A1 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 both make it clear that if the decisions of the two meetings are at variance, the decision of the creditors' meeting is the one that has effect. So those concerned may rely on that decision and act accordingly. That would continue to be the case until such time as the court ordered otherwise. For that reason the timing of any application by a member of a company is not critical for the nominee or supervisor, so we do not see any reason to restrict the time period in which a member of a company can make such an application, particularly as we have given the court adequate powers under paragraph 34(5) to deal with the situation where it sees merit in an application by a member. Indeed, a member may well need considerably more than seven days to consider his position.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para4"></a>However, if a member was concerned that prompt implementation of a voluntary agreement, as approved by the creditors and rejected by the members, was damaging to his circumstances, he would need to make an early application to the court in order to protect his interests. He would do that promptly because it is in his interest to do so, irrespective of any time limit.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para5"></a>In addition, the amendments do not work on their own terms. They require an application to be made to the court within seven days of the decision of the creditors' meeting which is at variance with that taken by the meeting of the company. But the company meeting which takes that decision may take place, say, 10 days after the decision taken by the creditors' meeting. Where that happens the time limit for making an application to the court will have expired before it is known that the two decisions are at variance.

<A NAME="00615-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am perfectly happy to accept that amendment to my amendment. The point I am making is that we need a clear rule. I shall return to this matter at Report and meanwhile beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="00615-30_para9"></a>Paragraph 35 of the new Schedule A1 deals with the effect of the approval of a voluntary arrangement. Sub-paragraph (2) provides that a voluntary arrangement binds those who are entitled to vote at a creditors' meeting and those who would have been so <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>entitled if they had had notice of it. However, a creditor would still be entitled to vote at a creditors' meeting even if he had not had notice of it. Sub-paragraph (2)(b)(ii) has no effect because no creditor would have been entitled to vote if he had had notice of the creditors' meeting. Notice is irrelevant for the purposes of entitlement to vote. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   These amendments certainly address real issues, which we do recognise. Firstly, they replace the word "would" with "could" and secondly replace "if he had had" with "but did not have".
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para10"></a>If these amendments were to be accepted we consider that, in relation to the first issue, on occasion they may have the unfortunate consequence of the "unknown creditor"&#151;that is, the one who had not had notice of the meeting to consider the voluntary arrangement proposal&#151;being bound by that arrangement when he should not be. We only want a voluntary arrangement to bind those who would have been entitled to vote at a meeting if they had had notice of it. We do not want a creditor who could have been entitled to vote to be bound by a voluntary arrangement in the event that they would not have been so entitled at the meeting once the votes had been determined.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para11"></a>What we do intend to do&#151;and I hope this will reassure the noble Lord&#151;is to make provision in the Insolvency Rules to define in which circumstances an unknown creditor would have been entitled to vote at the creditors' meeting if he had had notice of it. This will make it possible to say with certainty whether a creditor would have been entitled to vote and therefore whether he is bound by the arrangement. I think the Red Queen would have one or two things to say about this issue.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para12"></a>With regard to the amendments which address the second issue, these may be consequential on those which address the first, but we do not see that they would change the substance of relevant paragraphs in any way. The amendments only restate the contents of those paragraphs in different terms. We are satisfied that the meaning of those paragraphs is perfectly clear.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para13"></a>As the case may be, they either provide that a voluntary arrangement binds every person who in accordance with the rules would have been entitled to vote at the meeting to consider a voluntary arrangement proposal if he had received notice of it; or provide that such a person may apply to the court to challenge the decisions taken at those meetings.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that notice is not relevant as to the entitlement to vote, but Rule 1.17 of the Insolvency Rules says:

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-30_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 72 and 90. All three of these amendments concern the position of creditors who may have rights under the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para19"></a>As we have just discussed, paragraph 35 binds creditors into the terms of a voluntary arrangement. However, that could have the effect of prejudicing their position against a third party insurer. Such creditors should not be bound by those arrangements if it prejudices those rights to recover their claim from the insolvency insurer. In the case of Sea Voyager Maritime Inc and others v Bielecki, the court held that a creditor who was bound by an arrangement was unfairly prejudiced because the compromise of his debt prevented him from proceeding against the insurer. This problem would be exacerbated by the proposed new provisions unless we made a specific exemption for creditors who have such claims.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para20"></a>The amendments to the three pieces of the Bill provide just that. They provide statutory protection solely for the purpose of enabling the creditor to proceed against an insurer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Again, I think I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, on this point. I understand the concern that the noble Lord has expressed and I sympathise with it, but we do not consider the amendments are necessary. We take the view, and there is case law which supports it, that creditors who are able to make a claim under the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930 and who find themselves bound by a voluntary arrangement should be able to seek relief from the court on the grounds of unfair prejudice under either paragraph 36 of Schedule A1 of the Bill, or Sections 6 or 262 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para21"></a>It was decided in the case of Sea Voyager Maritime Inc and others v Bielecki that a person who is bound by a voluntary arrangement is prejudiced as a creditor by the terms of the arrangement if that person is not able, or at the very least, may not be able, to proceed to judgment for the full amount of any claim that it may <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have against the debtor and thus cannot, or may not be able to, recover in respect of that claim against the insurer under the 1930 Act. The application for relief in that case was made under Section 262 of the Insolvency Act 1986, because it relates to individual voluntary arrangements. That section is reproduced in paragraph 36 of Section A1 and Clause 6 of this Bill, and Section 6 of the Act.
<P>

<a name="00615-30_para22"></a>Thus, a person who suffers unfair prejudice because their rights under the 1930 Act have been impaired may apply to and should be granted relief by the court under either paragraph 36 of Schedule A1 to the Bill, or Sections 6 or 262 of the Act as appropriate.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-31_para1"></a><P>

<a name="00615-31_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: With this amendment I speak also to Amendments Nos. 44, 73, 74, 91 and 92. These amendments relate to the company voluntary arrangement procedure, with or without a moratorium, and to the individual voluntary arrangement procedure, with or without an interim order, respectively. They are taken together as they address an identical point.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para3"></a>Paragraph 35 of Schedule A1, paragraph 6 of Schedule 2, and paragraph 9 of Schedule 3 all provide for "unknown creditors"&#151;that is, those creditors bound by a voluntary arrangement even though they did not receive notice of the meeting to consider the proposal&#151;to receive any "dividend" to which they would have been entitled. But the word "dividend" carries the connotation that it is a sum calculated at a rate of so many pence in the pound. However, a voluntary arrangement can provide for different creditors to receive varying amounts which might be calculated in different ways. For example, it could provide that each creditor should receive a specific sum, say &#163;1,000, irrespective of the amount of individual claims, or, say, 10 per cent. in the pound on the amount of his claim; or perhaps a sum calculated by way of reference to the sum paid to a class of known creditors. We do not intend to fetter those proposing voluntary arrangements in such a way that proposals can only provide for the position of unknown creditors to be addressed in only one way, so the amendments will replace "dividend" with "amount" to achieve that result. I beg to move.

<a name="00615-31_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I speak to Amendments Nos. 47 and 48, extremely tersely. In paragraph 36(5) of new Schedule A1, the reference to paragraph 30 should be a reference to paragraph 34. We also think it would be appropriate for the court to have a discretion as to whether or not it revokes and suspends any decision as proving the voluntary arrangement which has effect on paragraph 34. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Paragraph 36(5) largely replicates Section 6(5) of the Insolvency Act 1986, which deals with company voluntary arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para10"></a>In both cases the effect of the provision is that, where the court is satisfied that a revised proposal will not be submitted for consideration by the meetings which the court has directed to be held, it is required to revoke the direction and revoke or suspend any decision approving the voluntary arrangement which has taken effect.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para11"></a>If this amendment were to be agreed to, an inconsistency would be introduced between the procedure leading to a company voluntary arrangement which is preceded by a moratorium and one which is not. That is to say that where the arrangement is preceded by a moratorium the court may revoke or suspend any decision approving the voluntary arrangement. But where there is no moratorium the court must revoke or suspend the decision. This inconsistency would not be appropriate. It is our intention to insert a moratorium into the existing company voluntary arrangement procedure&#151;that is what this Bill is about&#151;and the existing procedure should only be modified where the existence of the moratorium requires it, which is not the case here.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para12"></a>Some people might suggest that it is Section 6(5)&#151;that is, the original scheme&#151;which is wrong and that the court should be able to exercise its discretion in these circumstances in relation to both Section 6(5) and paragraph 36(5). However, that would be inappropriate as well. The challenges we are concerned with here arise from situations where the court has accepted that some form of unfair prejudice or material irregularity has taken place and where the court has directed that further meetings be held but is satisfied that the directors do not intend to submit a revised proposal. In such circumstances, it is clearly appropriate that the court should either suspend the decision approving the voluntary arrangement or revoke it, thus giving relief from the effects of the unfair prejudice or the material irregularity concerned.

It is more appropriate&#151;and more consonant with modern practice&#151;for such applications to be made in accordance with the system in Part 7 of the Insolvency Rules 1986, which set out how court applications are made in insolvency cases.

( ) In relation to any time when an administration order is in force in relation to the company, or the company is being wound up, in pursuance of a petition presented before the moratorium came into force, no application for an order under this paragraph may be made by a creditor or member of the company; but such an application may be made instead by the administrator or (as the case may be) liquidator.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-31_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: Paragraph 38 of Schedule A1 enables any creditor or shareholder of the company to challenge the acts or omissions of the directors of the company during the moratorium. They can do this either during the moratorium or after it has come to an end. When dealing with such an application the court can make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of the matters complained of. It could, for instance, order a transaction to be reversed or compensation to be paid by whoever the court decided.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para23"></a>On Second Reading it was suggested that third parties might be discouraged from dealing with a company during a moratorium period because of fears that the transaction in which they were involved might later be overturned by the courts. It is probably <P>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unlikely that a court would upset a transaction to the detriment of a third party who dealt with the company in good faith and for value. However, we recognise that a fear of that possibility could act as a real disincentive for people to deal with a company during a moratorium, so we have brought forward this amendment, first, to make it clear that when a court is considering giving relief in respect of a complaint under paragraph 38, it must safeguard the interest of persons who have dealt with the company in good faith and for value.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para24"></a>The second part of the amendment addresses the position under paragraph 38 when an administration order or winding-up order is made against the company on a petition which had been presented to the court before the moratorium was obtained. This situation necessarily implies that no voluntary arrangement has resulted.
<P>

<a name="00615-31_para25"></a>Both administration and liquidation are collective insolvency procedures; that is, they operate so as to affect the interests of all the insolvent's creditors who are then dealt with in accordance with the statutory schemes in the Insolvency Act. It is therefore appropriate that when one of those procedures is invoked on a petition which was presented before a moratorium was obtained, but was then stayed by it, the right to make an application under paragraph 38 should be exercisable by the administrator or liquidator rather than by individual creditors or shareholders, otherwise there would be an unacceptable conflict.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para2"></a>Section 206&#151;Members of the Committee will like this part&#151;is derived from the Companies Act 1985, which was derived from the Companies Act 1948, which, in turn, was derived from the Companies Act 1929. The section in the 1929 Act seems to have been based on another provision in the Bankruptcy Act 1914, which, in turn, was derived from the Debtors Act 1869. All of these sections refer to a company officer, or the debtor, as the case may be, being guilty of an offence if he is, or is privy to another, concealing, destroying or mutilating or falsifying relevant books or papers, making a false entry in such books or papers or fraudulently parting with or altering or making omissions from such books or papers. However, none of those other sections provides for an officer, or a debtor, to be guilty of an offence if they are privy to another concealing, fraudulently removing or pawning any of the company's or debtor's property. However, that is not a difficulty as existing legislation already allows for the prosecution of directors who are privy to others dealing with the company's property in a way which constitutes an offence under Section 206 of the Act and paragraph 39 of Schedule A1. Officers might be prosecuted in this regard under, say, The Accessories and Abettors Act 1861.
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para3"></a>Accordingly, if this paragraph were to be amended as is proposed, it could cast doubt on the meaning of the existing provisions on which it was modelled and also on the use of other legislation to prosecute those officers who are privy to offences by others in relation to company assets.

<a name="00615-32_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 64. The point I make here is brief. It may have been relevant to the previous amendments. We can see no justification for the limit of &#163;500 in sub-paragraphs (4)(a) and (b). Any officer who conceals any part of a company's property, even if worth under &#163;500, should be guilty of an offence. I am aware that this goes back to 1914 but should that alone allow people to remove, for example, a second-hand lap-top, something which is eminently stealable? Surely this is why we have a Parliament so that we can make and change laws, otherwise what are we here for? We have an opportunity to make sure that this does <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I like the idea of using a legislative opportunity to improve the law. However, I would like to point out, first, that the two offences where this limit will apply are very specific offences which can only apply in insolvency situations; in this case, during the 12 months immediately before the moratorium commenced and during the moratorium itself. These two offences are concealing any part of the company's property or fraudulently removing any part of the company's property. If misconduct which could amount to theft has occurred&#151;or any other type of offence&#151;it could be considered for prosecution as such and no minimum financial limit prescribed by the Bill would apply to that. Secondly, similar offences exist elsewhere in the Insolvency Act 1986; for example, in Section 206, which deals with offences in relation to companies that are would up and, in Section 354, relating to bankruptcies. Both have a &#163;500 minimum limit and offences of this kind have had a minimum limit at least as far back as the Bankruptcy Act 1914, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, referred, when the figure involved was &#163;10.
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para8"></a>Thirdly, if we discovered that we could not prosecute individuals for these two offences in cases where we thought we should be able to, we would review the &#163;500 minimum limit and we would not need primary legislation to do so. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 gives the Secretary of State the power to vary the minimum value of the property for the purpose of these offences and we would have no hesitation in reviewing that level if we felt it was appropriate. However, experience in relation to both Sections 206 and 354 suggests that &#163;500 is the right cut off point and it seems a perfectly reasonable assumption that it will be the appropriate level here too. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-32_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I hear what the Minister has said but cannot agree with him. I think it is "broke" and that we should fix it, in which case we will consider what he has had to say today but may well return to this at Report stage. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-32_para11"></a><P>

<a name="00615-32_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 57 I shall also speak to Amendment No. 59. Paragraph 41 of the new Schedule A1 renders any provision of a floating charge void if a moratorium, or a preliminary step, should be a crystallising event. The Opposition <P>


<a name="column_CWH50"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe, with the greatest possible respect, that this paragraph needs refining which is what these amendments seek to do. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-32_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It is standard practice for a debenture creating a floating charge to identify certain events, the occurrence of which will trigger the floating charge to crystallise and/or the right to appoint a receiver. In practice, a debenture may cross-refer to the events of default set out in the documentation for the loan which the debenture is securing because those events of default will commonly be events which will trigger crystallisation of a floating charge and/or the right to appoint a receiver. This device avoids the need for these events of default to be set out in full in both the document creating the floating charge and the loan documentation.
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para13"></a>The fact remains, however, that the provision which provides for or will trigger crystallisation will be contained in the debenture itself and not elsewhere. That will be so even when crystallisation is triggered by cross referencing to events contained in other documentation. Paragraph 41, therefore, properly targets provisions contained in an instrument creating a floating charge. I urge the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to withdraw these two amendments.
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para14"></a>At the same time, I wish to speak to Amendment No. 58, which is in the same group. On Second Reading I said that we had a concern that without an amendment the stay on creditors' rights contained in the Bill would not be fully effective against possible action by the holder of a floating charge. This was dealt with by Amendment No. 17. I said also that we would bring forward an amendment to ensure that provisions that might be included in charge documents, which would allow restrictions to be imposed on the company's ability to deal with assets covered by a floating charge, could not be triggered either because a moratorium had been obtained or because of anything done to obtain a moratorium. This amendment deals with the latter point.
<P>

<a name="00615-32_para15"></a>Paragraph 41 already provides that a provision in the document allowing a floating charge to crystallise&#151;that is, become a fixed charge&#151;if a company obtains a moratorium or takes action with a view to obtaining a moratorium, is to be void. Otherwise, such provisions might become commonplace and make rescues very difficult. This amendment provides that a provision in the floating charge document, which would allow restrictions to be imposed on the company's ability to deal with its assets, is also to be void if triggered by a company obtaining a moratorium or taking action to obtain a moratorium. Without this amendment, such provisions might also become a standard feature of floating charge documents and mean that a company would not be able to deal with its assets in the way it could before it took action to obtain the moratorium. Obviously, if as a consequence of such a provision, a company had to seek leave of the court or permission of the chargeholder under paragraph 19 of Schedule A1 before it could deal with its assets during a <P>

<a name="00615-33_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: With this amendment we are responding to the proposed additional grounds for a winding-up petition in paragraph 6 of Schedule 1, which we believe to be a waste of time. If the company is insolvent, a petitioner can rely upon paragraph (f) in Section 122(1) of the Act. If the company is not insolvent, there is no reason for the ground. Why should a moratorium come to an end with no voluntary arrangement being approved, to give a right to a creditor to wind up a solvent company? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Where a company has not been able to reach an accommodation with a creditor, it will almost certainly be in considerable financial difficulty. Cessation of business is probably almost inevitable and liquidation is highly likely&#151;and probably appropriate. In such circumstances, what <P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be the point of requiring a creditor intent on winding up the company to suffer the delay and expense in establishing the company's insolvency to the satisfaction of the court as would otherwise be required of him by Sections 122 and 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986? It is far better to allow that creditor to petition on the grounds that no voluntary arrangement had been agreed when the moratorium ended.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para11"></a>However, even that does not mean that liquidation is inevitable. The court will, of course, retain its discretion on whether or not to make a winding-up order on such an application. If it did not consider it appropriate to exercise its discretion to make a winding-up order, then no order would be made, notwithstanding the fact that the company had failed to secure agreement of a voluntary arrangement following a moratorium.

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-33_para13"></a><P>

<a name="00615-33_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 95. Both amendments seek to clarify the position of claims by creditors arising in the case of voluntary arrangements. Paragraph 42(9) provides that the effective date of these claims should be that of filing. There can be a delay between filing and the date on which the arrangement takes place. I believe it is important that the claims of creditors arising in the period between filing and the approval of the arrangements should be included in those arrangements. That is what Amendment No. 63 seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para15"></a>In the case of Amendment No. 93, paragraph 12 of Schedule 3 deals with the situation where claims arise between an interim order and the approval of a voluntary arrangement. With this amendment I am seeking to ensure that the claims of creditors which arise in the period between that of an interim order, where there is one, and the approval of a voluntary arrangement are included in that arrangement. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, on this point. The effect of paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 will be that when a company voluntary arrangement is approved following a moratorium, the date by reference to which any preferential debts are to be established will be the date of the commencement of the moratorium. In insolvency legislation this reference date is described as the "relevant date".
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para16"></a>This proposal will be consistent with a consequential change which we propose to make to the Insolvency Rules 1986. This concerns the calculation of the amount of creditors' claims for the purposes of both <P>


<a name="column_CWH53"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>voting on and being bound by a proposal for a voluntary arrangement involving a moratorium. Under existing rules 1.17, to which I have already referred, and 5.17 creditors' claims are usually calculated as at the date of the meeting. But we believe that, where a moratorium is involved, they should be calculated at the date the moratorium comes into force and we propose to amend the rules accordingly.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para17"></a>As a result, only those creditors for debts outstanding when the moratorium is obtained will be eligible to vote on and be bound by any agreed voluntary arrangement. Those creditors for debts incurred after the start of the moratorium will not be eligible to vote on and will not be bound by the voluntary arrangement and will, once the moratorium comes to an end, be able to pursue the company or debtor for those debts in the normal way. Accordingly, debts arising during a moratorium will be dealt with on a different basis from pre-existing debts.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para18"></a>In non-moratorium cases the date for calculating creditors' claims will remain the date of the meeting to approve the arrangement and that is why the relevant date for calculating preferential debts in those cases will be the date on which the voluntary arrangement takes effect, as provided in Schedule 2 paragraph 11 and Schedule 3 paragraph 13.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para19"></a>If the amendments proposed to paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 were to be accepted the result would be that preferential creditors would be placed at a disadvantage in relation to other creditors.

<a name="00615-33_para35"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 79 to 81 and 101 to 105. As your Lordships are aware Clause 10 amends Section 219 of the 1986 Act by restricting the use of evidence obtained in an investigation under Section 218(5) in criminal proceedings. This amendment is made because of the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para36"></a>In our submission, the same issue arises with respect to evidence obtained under Section 133 and Section 236 of the 1986 Act. Following the decision of the European Court of Justice in the case of Saunders v the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State has developed and applied a policy of not using against an accused in criminal proceedings a transcript of his compelled evidence.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para37"></a>As far as insolvency proceedings are concerned, evidence is compelled from office holders pursuant to the powers contained in Section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or by inspectors appointed under the Companies Act. In a case called ex parte McCormick, a judicial review over the use of compelled evidence failed. However, it was by definition, a case that took place before 2nd October 2000, the date when the Human Rights Act comes into force; and the narrow principles of Wednesbury, unreasonableness and irrationality, are likely to limit the usefulness of this precedent for the future.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para38"></a>There are associated two issues here, issues with which the Minister will by now be extremely familiar as a result of his experiences in taking through your Lordships' House the Financial Services and Markets Bill, now the Act, and the Utilities Bill. The first of these issues concerns whether or not, in effect, the procedures to which I have already referred under the 1986 Act are essentially criminal.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para39"></a>In deciding whether a given charge is criminal under the Human Rights Convention, the first matter to consider is how the offence is described in the domestic system of law. If it is described as criminal that is the end of the matter. If it is not, that is not the end of the matter because then the court must consider the nature of the offence and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person accused is likely to incur.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para40"></a>In the opinion of the European Commission for Human Rights, it is relevant if the measure complained of affects the general interests of society normally protected by the criminal law. In a recent case called Soci&#233;t&#233; Stenuit v France, the European Commission for Human Rights held that a ministerial power to fine a company for anti-competitive practices did, indeed, involve a criminal charge. Although disqualification proceedings are not criminal proceedings according to domestic law, they have many characteristics which would align them to criminal penalties.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para41"></a>The proceedings are undertaken on the initiative of the authorities. The allegations are instituted following a formal investigation undertaken by officials invested with special powers. The penalties are really severe if the party investigated is found to have offended. The investigations involve considerable interference with the freedom of the individual. And the penalties involved impose a heavy costs burden and affect the status of the individual as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para42"></a>For all those reasons, I believe there are sound grounds for arguing that, in effect, these offences are criminal offences. If that is so, any individual pursued under them would be entitled to the full protection of Articles 6.1 to 6.3 of the European Convention. It is clear that that protection is not reflected in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para43"></a>Even if I am wrong, these offences still attract substantial protection for the individual under Article 6.1; because the protection under Article 6.1 applies to civil as well as criminal offences. The European Court of Human Rights has held in a number of cases that in determining the civil rights of an individual, the principles of "equality of arms" and "fair balance" apply between the parties.
<P>

<a name="00615-33_para44"></a>This is not an appropriate moment to develop this point any further. I believe I know what the Minister is going to say in response to what I have said; if I do not then I have cautious grounds for optimism. I look forward with great interest to hearing what he has to say. I beg to move.

<A NAME="00615-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 101, which is included in this group, and by comparison with the recent exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is a modest contribution to the debate. It seeks to clarify what evidence the prosecution would be capable of leading to, or introducing into, criminal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para0"></a>The term "relating to" used in Clause 19 is a wide one. As presently drafted, it seems to prohibit the prosecution from taking any evidence related to the terms of the reply, including the circumstances surrounding the making of the reply. That is too wide. While on the one hand compelled evidence is clearly not something that one would want to see used in prosecution, it should be possible to ensure that the privilege of non-self-incrimination is maintained while allowing the prosecutor to bring in other competent evidence. Therefore, replacing the words "relating to" with the word "of" would achieve that objective.

<a name="00615-34_para1"></a> And battles long ago".
The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, knows perfectly well that we believe that these human rights issues are important. That is why Clause 10 of the Bill amends Section 219 of the Insolvency Act. Clause 10 provides in terms that answers obtained using the powers exercisable under Section 218(5) of the Act&#151;namely, those exercisable under Sections 431 or 432 of the Companies Act 1985&#151;cannot be used in evidence in criminal proceedings against the person who gave those answers other than in very limited circumstances. Similar provision is made in relation to new Section 7A(6) of the Act by paragraph 10 of Schedule 2.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para2"></a>However, it is already the case that answers given at an examination under Section 133 and 236 of the Insolvency Act cannot be used in evidence in criminal proceedings against the person concerned, again, subject to limited exceptions. That is because, on 14th April of this year, paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 came into effect amending Section 433 of the Insolvency Act.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-34_para20"></a><P>

("( ) It shall be competent for a director to object to proceedings being retained in the wrong court and to apply to the court to transfer proceedings to the proper or more appropriate court for determination; and if the court is satisfied that proceedings should be transferred, they shall be transferred to a specified court for determination.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-34_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to make clear that a director can object to proceedings being retained in the wrong court and seek to have them transferred to the proper or more appropriate court. Under the Bill as drafted, proceedings could be raised in the wrong court, to the prejudice of a respondent director. If the director should be given an opportunity to address this issue, then it is appropriate that he or she be afforded the opportunity of making representations in the proper form. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It is not necessary to make this provision. The court already has the power to transfer proceedings to another court when it considers it appropriate to do so. Therefore, it is open to a party to the proceedings to apply to transfer those proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response, on which basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="00615-34_para30"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment refers to a matter to which I spoke at Second Reading, dealing with the position of insolvent estates. It is necessary that there should be no retrospective effect on any third party who might have acquired property in good faith. This is why the amendment states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection 5 shall not apply in relation to the estate of a person who died before the coming into force of that subsection".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, which he also raised at Second Reading. We agree that, left as it is, this clause could prejudice the marketability of property where the deceased's interest in jointly-owned property has passed to the survivor on death, irrespective of whether the deceased is solvent or not. We would not wish an arm's length disposal of a <P>


<a name="column_CWH58"></a>

<B>15 Jun 2000 : Column CWH58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>property by a surviving partner to be made unnecessarily difficult because prospective purchasers were concerned that they might find they did not have good title if the deceased's estate became insolvent.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para32"></a>However, we are not in a position to put down an amendment to deal with this point at this stage. We are in the process of preparing one which should deal with this concern and we will bring this forward as soon as it is ready.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para33"></a>We also propose that the new provision will apply only in those cases where the petition for the insolvency administration order is presented after the new provision has come into force. We recognise that this will not go as far as the proposed amendment. However, on that point I would have to say that we are not convinced that the creditors of an insolvent estate should be in a worse position if the debtor has died than if he is living. We think that limiting the application of the new provision in the way I have just described strikes an appropriate balance.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para34"></a>We are also looking at how we might protect the position of innocent third parties where there have been dealings in the property between the date of death and an insolvency administration order. I hope that reassures the noble Lord, Lord Sharman.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615-34_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am much reassured and I look forward to seeing the amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="00615-34_para39"></a><P>

<a name="00615-34_para40"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 109. The amendment provides that the consent of Scottish Ministers must be obtained before the Secretary of State makes regulations extending to Scotland giving effect to the UNCITRAL model law on cross-border insolvency under this clause. This is appropriate as implementation of the model law is likely to touch on matters which have been devolved to that jurisdiction. Additionally, the amendment makes it clear that the agreement of the Lord Chancellor is only necessary where such regulations are to extend to England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="00615-34_para41"></a>Perhaps I may refer to Amendment No. 108. In that amendment the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, proposes that regulations under Clause 13 should be made with the agreement of the Advocate General for Scotland as well as that of the Lord Chancellor, but we propose by amendment of this clause that regulations be made, in so far as they extend to Scotland, with the agreement of Scottish Ministers. That has been done with the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Furthermore, the clause, as we propose it to be amended, will mean that regulations extending to England and Wales will be made with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor. I beg to move.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Answer by the Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 20 March (H.L. Deb., cols. 7-9), whether their feral cat control programme for Ascension Island has been put into operation; if so, what are the results; and, if not, by when they hope to have it completed.[HL2710]<P></UL>

<A NAME="00615w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  The Ascension Island feral cat programme (funded by the FCO) started on 29 May. It is proceeding satisfactorily. We are receiving weekly reports from the Administrator of Ascension. The programme should be completed by October. This timing should ensure a successful breeding season for Ascension's colony of sooty terns, which has suffered heavily from predation from the feral cats.

<A NAME="00615w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The United Kingdom has played a leading role in the European Union in calling for free and fair elections in Peru. We discussed the issue with our European partners in Brussels on 31 May and 7 June and member states released a statement on 9 June reaffirming our continuing concerns over the irregularities and anomalies in the election process. We fully support the decision by the OAS to send a mission to Peru to examine ways of strengthening democracy. At present, there are no plans to invite Alejandro Toledo to the United Kingdom, but he would of course be welcome if he were to come.

I am satisfied that the substance of the existing guidance, which is of long standing, remains basically sound. It is necessarily of a general kind, for application in individual circumstances. I am satisfied that it strikes an appropriate balance in discouraging activities or interests which may be seen to undermine judicial impartiality, or conflict with judicial office, without being unduly restrictive. I have at the same time made a number of detailed changes in the text and added a statement of general principles. I will wish to keep the new guidance under review in the light of experience. The general guidance on outside activities and interests is separate from any question of conflict of interest arising in individual cases on which the Court of Appeal recently gave further authoritative guidance in its judgment in the case of Lockbail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd.

<A NAME="00615w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton:  </B>  The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis included performance data for the first 11 months of the last financial year, and projected performance in its final month, in his Policing and Performance Place for 2000&#150;01, which he published on 31 March, on the Metropolitan Police Webside http://www.met.police.uk.

<a name="00615w02_para0"></a>The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis tells my right honourable friend, the Home Secretary, that he expects to publish a hard copy version of the Plan on 21 June. This will include full-year performance data for 1999&#150;2000. These data confirm, I understand, the provisional out-turns included in the version of the plan published on 31 March.

<P>
<UL>Whether they will publish the terms of reference to the consultation in respect of additional airport runway capacity in the South East; and which bodies they have invited to respond.[HL2756]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  Terms of reference for the South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study were published, after public consultation, on 9 February. Copies are available from the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="00615w02_para3"></a>The commissioning of the SERAS study, and the consultation on the proposed appraisal framework to be used in that study, has resulted in a wide range of organisations making representations.
<P>

<a name="00615w02_para4"></a>We are currently in the early stages of assessing options, at both existing airports and possible new sites. We will proceed through successive sifts to narrow down options to a final shortlist, on which there will be a full public consultation before Ministers come to decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="00615w02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   As the then Minister for Transport announced on 11 March 1999, the South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study will examine a wide range of options and has started from the position that nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out.
<P>

<a name="00615w02_para5"></a>Options will be appraised through a process of successive sifts. A very large number of options will be considered during the sifting process, which is designed to reduce the options to a manageable number, so that those can be appraised in sufficient detail to support a meaningful public consultation at the end of the study.
<P>

<a name="00615w02_para6"></a>Until then, it would be premature to comment on the status of any option.

Between the late 1940s and late 1970s schools such as that attended by the Lord Privy Seal were known as direct grant grammar schools.
