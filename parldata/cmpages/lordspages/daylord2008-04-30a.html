I will have to make it up. Confronted with a missing Answer I have no choice but to say that we are confident that when there is an opportunity to review sanctions, the UN Security Council will, if necessary, strengthen them with regard to Iran&#146;s nuclear programme.</p>

Let us hope that he is right. I hope that he does not look at his papers and find the opposite in a few moments&#146; time, but then it will be too late. Meanwhile, I am sure that my noble friend will agree that there is deep concern that Iran continues openly to defy the will of the international community. Indeed, earlier this month it announced the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges at its nuclear plant in Natanz, which doubled its previous capacity and ensured that it comes ever closer to possessing nuclear weapons. Given that, does my noble friend&#151;whether he has his notes or not&#151;share my great alarm, especially at the Iranian president's continuing anti-Semitic attacks on Israel, calling it &#147;filthy bacteria&#148; and questioning its right to exist? What specific measures will Her Majesty's Government now propose to the Security Council to increase the weight of sanctions imposed on Iran? Is my noble friend confident that there is sufficient consensus within the Security Council further to strengthen the sanctions so that they will become effective?</p>

The IAEA&#146;s most recent report raised a number of issues of great concern about its compliance with the Security Council resolutions. We are appalled by the statements made by the President about Israel and its right to exist. As for the future, we have already seen the overwhelming support of the international community for the E3+3 dual-track policy reflected in four UN Security Council votes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08043096000041"></a>As for what happens next, much depends on how Iran chooses to comply or not with its international obligations, but we believe that if further measures are required, the international community will continue to support them.</p>

In 2003, the Iranian Government asked for a wider discussion about security in the region. The United States vetoed that. Iran has been mildly helpful in Iraq and considerably helpful in Afghanistan. Is there not a case for a wider framework for discussions within which we can then make progress on the nuclear issue?</p>

However, it is very difficult to reward non-compliance by formally broadening the dialogue at this point. If Iran complies with the Security Council resolutions, a broader dialogue will follow as part of the careful set of incentives that have been constructed to reward compliance.</p>

Is not the right answer to the thoroughly justifiable unease and alarm expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Janner, that there is no consensus in the Security Council? Russia and China are not playing along with the aim to squeeze Iran; in fact Russia is trying to supply further nuclear equipment to Iran. Is not the basic economic reality that with $120 oil Iran is doing quite nicely thank you and the sanctions are having minimal and probably zero effect? Is not the need now, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, indicated, to bring the Russians and even the Chinese into the discussion, although it may be distasteful to our American allies, rather than trying to penalise them as well? Without those two, the chances of any serious global pressure on Iran are zero, and it is bound to head for both a civil nuclear and a weaponised nuclear programme.</p>

China and Russia are part of this negotiation, and we hope that they are very much committed to this process.</p>

They are stepping up the enrichment. Those reports come from the resistance body that told the world five or six years ago about the Iranians&#146; illegal nuclear activities.</p>

My noble friend is right that the IAEA inspectors still cannot get the access that they seek. Nevertheless, the very nature of this problem&#151;a diversified, decentralised programme across Iran&#151;does not lend itself to a military as against a diplomatic solution. We are convinced that the right set of incentives and punishments available diplomatically and through sanctions to force and encourage Iranian compliance remains the safest way forward, although it is certainly not assured of necessary success.</p>

The remuneration of the directors of such defined publicly owned companies is a matter for the remuneration committee of those companies, whose recommendations are submitted for approval to the Government as a shareholder.

How is it possible that, in the case of Northern Rock, the chief executive gets a massive pay-off in return for the total failure of the company and, in the case of Network Rail, the directors get large bonuses at the same time as Network Rail is being fined &#163;34,000 for incompetence? These are difficult issues to understand. Most people in Britain are asking whether those people who have accepted the money have no shame.</p>

At the end of the day, it is very difficult to say to a small businessman in Birmingham, &#147;By the way, the bank which asks you for a lot of information when it is about to lend you some money to do something and then judges your judgments accordingly, will be seen to be remunerating its directors substantially, despite big errors of judgment having been made&#148;. I want to live in a society which says, &#147;The sky&#146;s the limit; you can come to Britain and earn as much as you possibly can, but just be aware that you function in democratic capitalism because of the will of the people and if you do not deal with the perception you create you will pay a price&#148;.

If you want the best managers, you have to pay the going rate. Sometimes that is unpalatable to me and I am sure it is to my noble friends but, at the end of the day, if you want the best you have to pay for it. Thirdly, we should remember that if such people are paid the going rate, they must suffer the consequences of incompetence and errors of judgment.

Timing is so important. You can see an announcement of something like a fine, which has probably come after two or three years of investigation, and very soon after you see the remuneration paid, but that might be in relation to a completely different period. That is a fact; it might be unpalatable, but it is true. You have to get to the essential element of when the contract was entered into and ensure that the methodology will accommodate my noble friend&#146;s absolutely valid point.

There have been a number of tragic deaths of civilians and politicians in recent months in Sri Lanka. There has been a pick-up in violence, which is extremely alarming, and targeting of political leaders. We have been pressing&#151;most recently in my speech to the Human Rights Council&#151;for the High Commissioner for Human Rights to be allowed to open an office in Sri Lanka because we think it is enormously important to keep human rights observers and a broader international presence in that troubled country.</p>

I and other noble Lords in this House are all too aware of the divisions among the Sri Lankan communities in this country. I fear that the issue may go beyond the capacity of the Minister for social cohesion, as it is so deeply rooted in the conflict in Sri Lanka.

Cutting funds from Noraid to the IRA ensured that both parties came together.

It is for the UN to investigate individual allegations of misconduct and to ensure that the troop-contributing country concerned deals with any substantiated allegations. The UN&#146;s Office of Internal Oversight Services investigated the allegations on weapons and ammunition trading but did not find sufficient evidence to substantiate them. I might add that MONUC&#146;s peacekeepers play a vital role in resolving the conflict in the DRC.</p>

Does the Minister agree that the General Assembly&#146;s recent criticisms of the OIOS&#146;s investigations methodology indicate the need for urgent reform of the OIOS; and because it has an interest in exonerating the peacekeepers from criticism, can the Minister ensure that any such reforms include an external oversight of the OIOS by the equivalent of non-executive directors who are appointed from outside the UN system?</p>

The allegations were also, it might be added, localised and specific to one unit rather than widespread throughout the mission. Two witnesses from the militia changed their evidence in the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme from what they had said in the investigation, so it is difficult to know the veracity of their subsequent claims. However, the head of UN peacekeeping has made it clear that if the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme or anyone else has fresh evidence, that, too, will be investigated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08043096000081"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s second point, the OIOS is largely independent of the UN and reports directly to the General Assembly. There is also a new oversight body for audit matters of the General Assembly itself. The head of the OIOS is a former auditor-general of both Sweden and Kosovo, so she is quite a crusader for justice in the fight against corruption. I therefore suspect that this has been well investigated.</p>

However, 95 per cent of all weapons going into Africa are manufactured outside of Africa.

The good news about the Congo is that, for now at least, the violence is behind us. The peace agreement and elections, all of it policed and supported by MONUC, has led to a much more stable situation.

Without in any way condoning the reported malpractices, which of course, we must take very seriously, is not the bottom line that the 17,000 UN troops, or many of them, are really making some progress in bringing stability to this area which is so full of bloodshed and atrocities?

The great majority of the world&#146;s 110,000 UN peacekeepers are extraordinary people taking on difficult work under very difficult circumstances. Where there are allegations of corruption or of sexual exploitation, which has been another major issue, they are to do with a very small minority. I am confident that the United Nations and the troop-contributing countries are working hard to improve disciplinary and investigation arrangements to make sure that even these handful of cases, which tarnish the reputation of peacekeeping as a whole, are brought to a resolution and that those who are offenders are removed from any peacekeeping role.</p>

It is mainly insiders who, responding to that pressure, will have to strip out the layers of regulation and bureaucracy that make registering a company so difficult. The best pressure comes from seeing that countries such as Mozambique that have done so have been rewarded by high rates of economic growth and high rates of inward foreign investment.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08043096000095"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have tabled Amendment No. 1 in response to concerns raised in debate in Committee on pre-sentence reports for young offenders aged under 18. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 makes provision for oral reports to be made to a court. That enables cases for relatively minor offences to proceed where the offender is already known to the court representative and where, in most cases, a pre-sentence report will have been prepared on a previous recent occasion. It is right that a young person should be dealt with promptly when charged with a criminal offence if the case is proven. It is known that speedy intervention has the greatest effect on preventing reoffending. That is why we have focused on reducing the time for persistent young offenders to be brought before a court.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08043096000096"></a>The majority of pre-sentence reports, 80 per cent, will be full written reports, 11 per cent will be oral reports given to the court and the remaining 9 per cent are described as specific sentence reports&#151;shortened, written pre-sentence reports. Where the offence is fairly low level and the court has a recent full report before it, or where the offence is very minor, we believe it is in the young person&#146;s best interests that the case is proceeded with promptly. By way of example, where the young person has committed an offence of shoplifting of a low value item or minor criminal damage with no aggravating circumstances&#151;for instance, there is no associated drug abuse problem&#151;and the court is content that a full report is not required, we believe that an oral report may be appropriate. Similarly, an oral report on the current offence may be provided where the young person is a repeat offender and a written pre-sentence report was prepared for the previous offence and remains valid. In those cases, we think it

However, I acknowledge the concerns that were raised earlier about the need to ensure that where custody is being considered the court has the full background information before it in a written pre-sentence report.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08043096000097"></a>In Committee, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, expressed concern, as did other noble Lords, about the possibility of a young person being sentenced to custody without the court having a written report before it. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has expressed similar concerns. I can confirm that this possibility is not excluded, either in existing legislation, or the national standards for youth justice services. I acknowledge the concerns of noble Lords. Amendment No. 1 will ensure that the court has a written pre-sentence report when considering sentencing a young offender to custody.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08043096000098"></a>I will also deal with Amendment No. 2, which will be moved in due course by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. We are very grateful to the noble Lord for giving us the opportunity to discuss his amendment and our amendment with him this morning and earlier this afternoon. I think we understand his concern correctly: it is that Amendment No. 1 would mean that the court would have to decide that custody was appropriate before requesting a written pre-sentence report. He rightly pointed out that, in many cases, the court would not be able to come to such a view until it had seen the pre-sentence report.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08043096000099"></a>We have considered the matter further since the noble Lord&#146;s observations of earlier today. We can reassure the noble Lord that this is not the effect of Amendment No. 1. Section 156(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires that a court must, in respect of a person under the age of 18, obtain a pre-sentence report before reaching an opinion. Under Section 152(2) of that Act, the offence, or combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it, must be so serious that neither a fine alone, nor a community sentence, can be justified. In other words, the court must obtain a pre-sentence report before reaching a decision that the custody threshold has been met. In practice, this means that where the defendant pleads not guilty, but is convicted after a trial, the court will have to adjourn, and a pre-sentence report be prepared, in a case where custody is a possibility. I repeat those words: where custody is a possibility.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08043096000100"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 1 is that a written pre-sentence report will have to be prepared in those circumstances. The court will then be in a position to come to a view as to whether the offender has reached the custody threshold. The amendment will mean that the court cannot come to such a view without a written pre-sentence report. It also means that, as at present, written pre-sentence reports will be prepared in many instances where the court decides, in light of that report, that custody is not appropriate. I hope that answers noble Lords&#146; concerns, particularly those of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. There is no difference between us or around the House. A young person should not be sent to custody without a full written

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08043096000264"></a> After Clause 11, line 11, leave out &#147;156(3)(a)&#148; and insert &#147;156(3)&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08043096000102"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for his opening remarks. He will recall that, in Committee, widespread concern was expressed by many noble Lords about the absence of an obligation on a court to require a written report before a custodial sentence was passed. I would like to think that it was that strength of opinion that has led the Government to come forward with the amendment now before your Lordships. I am extremely grateful to the Government for responding in this manner.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08043096000103"></a>I do not think that the Government have gone quite far enough, which explains my amendment to their amendment. I would require written reports in all circumstances, whether the likely sentence was going to be custodial or some form of community sentence. It seems to me that particular care should be taken in respect of offenders aged under 18. I do not see why as much care should be taken in relation to those who are going to receive a community order of one sort or another as a custodial sentence; but I readily admit that our prime concern is with custodial sentences.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08043096000104"></a>I was extremely grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath and Lord Bach, for listening to my more technical preoccupations with their amendment. What exactly is meant by the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000285"></a>&#147;a pre-sentence report which is required to be obtained and considered before the court forms an opinion&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08043096000251"></a>mentioned in Section 156(3)(a)? It is quite clear that under that section a court must obtain and consider a pre-sentence report before forming an opinion as to whether, under Section 152(2), the custodial threshold had been reached. The difficulty is that a judge will not reach a conclusion on whether the custodial threshold has been reached until he has read the pre-sentence report. This means that the judge will have to take a view immediately after a defendant is convicted about whether there is the slightest chance that, following receipt of a report, he will pass a custodial sentence.</p>

<a name="80430-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08043096000105"></a>My understanding of what the noble Lord, Lord Bach, has said to the House is that it must be clear that if there is the slightest possibility that a custodial sentence might ensue&#151;only the judge will know that&#151;he must require the report to come to him in writing. In a sense, this amendment is saying that whether or not it is in writing is entirely up to the judge: at the end of the day, it is his subjective judgment to determine whether the report is required to be in writing or whether it can be an oral report.</p>

It is very important that Parliament is clear about what it is doing before it does it.</p>

One of the most important conclusions that a court can ever arrive at is to deprive a young person of his or her liberty. However, I am not sure that I entirely agree with the argument put forward so clearly and fairly by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.</p>
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="80430-0003.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08043096000299"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08043096000108"></a>There are two stages to the judge&#146;s consideration. First, and this follows rather slavishly the wording, if I remember rightly, of Section 152 of the 2003 Act, it must be considered whether the threshold for custody has been crossed&#151;in other words, whether the seriousness of that offence, with one other offence, at least, taken into consideration, is such that anything other than the custodial disposal would not be justified. That is not the exact wording but would be near to it.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08043096000109"></a>Therefore, there is a preliminary decision as to whether that threshold has been crossed. The learned judge then says, &#147;If that has been crossed, I will have to consider all the other considerations, including, of course, the offender&#146;s antecedence and, no doubt, all the information that can be given in either a written or an oral report&#148;. What is concerned here is not so much a final decision by the learned judge, but a preliminary one as to the crossing of that threshold line.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08043096000110"></a>My other point is that although a written report is always to be preferred to an oral one, I would like to pay the highest possible tribute to those hardworking probation officers in daily attendance at the courts who, sometimes at very short notice, will produce a most incisive and comprehensive report on an offender&#146;s situation. They can be helped, of course, by the learned judge having had the papers the night before and digested them and, having warned learned counsel before 10.30 am, informing that person that he would like that report done. Sometimes&#151;and I am afraid that I was guilty of this from time to time&#151;it might be at 12.45 pm that one would ask for that report by 2 pm.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08043096000111"></a>However, my own experience was that these reports were prepared with very great conscientiousness, dedication and thoroughness. Almost invariably, a person asked to conduct such an inquiry would first get in touch with the probation officer who had written the last report and, if that was not possible, to have the matter adjourned for a few hours until that report was available. Therefore, one should not demote the verbal report too much, because in most cases, it will be of a very high standard. It will enable the judge, once there has been a preliminary decision under Section 152, as a crossing of the threshold, to be able to review that situation in the light of all the information that the court will then have.</p>

I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan. If there is any real likelihood of a young person, usually a man, under the age of 18, going to prison, it would be most unlikely that the judge would not want, in any event, a written report and consideration of a great deal of what would come into such a report.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08043096000114"></a>This is a moment at which one can really leave it to the judge to decide what more he needs. I would like to pay tribute to the excellent oral reports that are given, but, where you are likely to go to prison, you are entitled to have a written report. I would have expected that to be provided in a case where a young person is likely to go to prison.</p>

We are very grateful to the Government for listening and for bringing forward this amendment. Unfortunately, I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, about the value of an oral report. Probation officers have in the past done their very best but I have always thought it unsatisfactory that they should be required at very short notice to take upon themselves the production of a report. Normally, these reports require inquiries and consultation with the family. It is far better that that be a considered process&#151;very much more so when the defendant is under 18.</p>

I argue that with Amendment No. 1, we have come up with the right answer. The only thing about which I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is whether there should necessarily be a written report in each case where a community sentence is imposed. We certainly agree with the view that was expressed around the House that there should be a written report in cases where a custodial sentence is or could be imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08043096000118"></a>The noble Lord is pressing me, quite rightly, to be as clear as possible. As I said when moving the amendment, in practice this means that where the defendant pleads not guilty but is tried and then found guilty, after conviction the court will have to adjourn and a pre-sentence report will be prepared in a case where custody is a possibility. I do not think that we can be much clearer than that. After that, it will be in the hands of the judge, who is the sentencer. </p>

It is a different argument for a written report but, I believe, an equally powerful one. Nevertheless, the Government have come forward with their amendment; it meets us at least halfway. In those circumstances, I shall not press my amendment this afternoon. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08043096000265"></a> Clause 16, page 11, line 18, leave out from &#147;is&#148; to end of line 37 and insert &#147;repealed&#148;</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08043096000125"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, the object of the amendment is to repeal Section 229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I should first explain why I did not press this amendment to a vote on Report. Section 229 of the 2003 Act contains the statutory definition of dangerousness. By subsection (3), which is the crucial subsection, the court is obliged to assume dangerousness if the offender has been convicted on two or more occasions of certain specified offences commonly known as the &#147;two strikes and you&#146;re out&#148; provision.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08043096000126"></a>That subsection is to be repealed by the Bill as it stands and I am very grateful to the Government that they are taking that course. All that will then be left of Section 229 is subsection (2). All that subsection (2) will say is that the court in assessing dangerousness,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000286"></a>&#147;must take into account of all such information as is available to it about the nature and circumstances of the offence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08043096000252"></a>and may take into account previous convictions. That is all Section 229 will then provide.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08043096000127"></a>On Report, I pointed out that the courts have always taken previous convictions into account. What else can they take into account more obviously than previous convictions? They really do not need to be told by Parliament that they may do that. I think that is now accepted by the Government, at least to that extent, that Section 229 is covered by the existing practice.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_251"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80430-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08043096000128"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, argued that the reference in Section 229 to information about the offence, or information about the offender, adds something that the courts have not always taken into account and he referred to the case of Considine in support of that argument. I was unfamiliar with that case so I needed to look at it before asking the House to express a view. I have now looked at it. It turns out that, so far from helping the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Bach, it helps mine. Indeed, I would go further than that and say that it is absolutely conclusive in favour of my argument. In an earlier decision, in the case of Johnson, the court said that subsection (2),</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000287"></a>&#147;adds nothing to the approach which the sentencer would normally take, that is, to consider all the information available to the court ... it is difficult to see how any sentencer, properly forming his judgment, would properly fail to take all matters of possible relevance into account&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08043096000253"></a>I say amen to that. That sentence in Johnson was expressly approved by a five-judge Court of Appeal in the case of Considine, the case on which the noble Lord, Lord Bach, relied.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08043096000129"></a>In the light of my looking at that case, I wrote to the noble Lord and to the Lord Chancellor to ask them to reconsider Clause 16. Once subsection (3) has gone&#151;and it is going&#151;to retain Section 229 is pointless. It is saying only what already happens. Hence my amendment to repeal Section 229 of the 2003 Act. In his letter of reply the Lord Chancellor makes three points. He accepts now that subsection (2) does reflect the existing practice of the judges in assessing dangerousness. But he says that the statute got there first. It is only in 2007 in Considine that the case law caught up with Section 229.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08043096000130"></a>It may be that that sounds odd, but it seems to me that that is what the Lord Chancellor is saying in this sentence of his letter:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08043096000266"></a>&#147;The fact that the courts did in fact, by a process of case law development, confirm by the end of 2007 that the statute reflects case law derived in other contexts as to assessing dangerousness is helpful&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08043096000254"></a>As I understand it, the argument is that the courts might have taken a different view in assessing dangerousness in relation to the new, indeterminate sentence than they have always done in relation to the ordinary life sentence. If that is the meaning of that argument, I suggest in all seriousness that it is scraping the very bottom of the barrel. It suggests that, in interpreting this new provision covering indeterminate sentences, the court might have excluded all together what is relevant in assessing dangerousness. In any event, what might have been the position no longer matters, because we now know as a result of Considine that there is no difference between Section 229 and the practice which the judges have already adopted. So I say to the House that Section 229, consisting of what it will consist of unless my amendment is adopted, is wholly otiose and should be repealed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08043096000131"></a>I can deal with the second and third arguments of the Lord Chancellor quite simply. The second argument was that it might imply an intention to repeal or alter the law substantially if we repealed Section 229. But we are of course altering the law substantially in the  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_252"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill by repealing subsection (3). That is the subsection which has the teeth, as I have tried to explain. We are not surely implying anything by repealing Section 229 about the information which courts ordinarily take into account in assessing dangerousness, because, as I have said, we now know that subsection (2) adds nothing to the existing practice.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08043096000132"></a>Finally, the letter states that Parliament can, if it wishes, embody case law in legislation, to which I say, &#147;Of course, it can&#148;. But there is surely no point in stating the obvious. It is surely our duty to shorten, so far as we can, and simplify legislation. We have an opportunity of doing that now by repealing Section 229, which if it remains, will simply be a blemish on the statute book. I invite the House to do that and beg to move.</p>

This Government have had the tendency to look overseas to the United States of America and adopt its practices. That is a country where 750 out of 100,000 people are in prison, as opposed to 150 out of 100,000 in this country and an average of about 70 or 80 in the rest of Europe. For that reason, they introduced as a good wheeze the idea of &#147;two strikes and you&#146;re out&#148;. The Government have recognised that that has done nothing to assist the administration of justice in this country. All it has done is serve to fill our prisons and produce the ridiculous anomalies of people being given indeterminate sentences, but with the proviso that they can apply for parole after 28 days. The end of that is very welcome to us. But we are now left with nothing, other than simply a repetition of what already has been the practice, as the Lord Chancellor has recognised in his letter. I urge your Lordships not to make nonsense of the criminal law in this way. The Government should go the whole hog.

Those, as the noble and learned Lord said, are set out in Section 229(2), which refers to previous offences and says that the court must take into account as well,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000288"></a>&#147;all such information as is available to it about the nature and circumstances of the&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="08043096000256"></a>any of the offences mentioned in its paragraph (a) or new paragraph (aa)<I></I>form part, and, lastly,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000290"></a>&#147;may take into account any information about the offender which is before it&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80430-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08043096000137"></a>We believe it is important to retain that statutory basis for the assessment of risk because it clarifies that the courts may look not just at the circumstances of the trigger offence, but take into account all such information as is available about the pattern of behaviour of which the offence formed part. That matter is of particular relevance to a court with a special responsibility for assessing an offender&#146;s prospective dangerousness, and a hallmark of public protection sentencing.</p>

I know that learned judges do that up and down the country. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, will hear me out before interrupting. In passing the Criminal Justice Act 2003, Parliament created a specific task for courts of assessing the dangerousness of sexual and violent offenders. The decision on risk would be made in the context of a new sentencing regime&#151;one that has particularly serious ramifications for offenders who fall into its scope. I think we agree that those ramifications can be extremely severe. We believe that it was important to have clarity, from the beginning, on the breadth of information and evidence that a court can consider in assessing dangerousness in this new context.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08043096000140"></a>On Report, I referred to the case of Considine, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Berwick, has made his analysis of it. That will perhaps teach me better, as a mere ex-junior member of the Bar, about trying to cross swords with the noble and learned Lord. If I were to have appeared before him in days gone by, the thought of that would have terrified me for the weekend before, but in what I hope is the safety of the House of Lords I will make my point on Considine.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08043096000141"></a>The noble and learned Lord asked whether we agreed that the Considine judgment showed that the new Section 229 would add nothing to the factors that a court would normally consider. The answer to that, to be absolutely blunt with the House, is that I do not think that it is particularly relevant to the issue that the House may have to decide in a few minutes whether we agree to that or not.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_254"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80430-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08043096000142"></a>As I explained, it would have been an omission for the Government to have failed to cover that point of the legislative scheme when we set up the legislation in 2003. The alternative would have been to trust the case law developed in other contexts in which dangerousness needed to be assessed and that that would be assessed and applied in the new context. We did not want to do that at the time because we wanted the new system to be clear from the very beginning, in view of the novelty and seriousness of the new sentencing proposals. As the noble and learned Lord told the House this afternoon, the courts did, in fact, by a process of case law development, confirm subsequently that the statute reflecting case law, derived in other contexts as to assessing dangerousness, is helpful. But does it follow that, because that is what the cases have decided, the statute is dispensable? We argue not. We do not believe that it is right to repeal the statute on the basis that subsequent case law would give courts the guidance that they need.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08043096000143"></a>It is, we think, particularly the case&#151;although I think that the noble and learned Lord disagrees with us on this point&#151;that a repeal of Section 229 would imply an intention to alter the law substantively. It has not been suggested that there is any need to change the position regarding the breadth of information that may be considered in the changes that we have made in this Bill. Indeed, we would argue that, given the wider changes that we are making to the public protection legislation, it is more important than ever that it remains in place. We think that repeal of Section 229 would therefore create a doubt where currently there is none. It is there in statute.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08043096000144"></a>For whose benefit will that be done? It is not necessarily for that of the learned judges who will of course have to pass sentences. However, I remind noble Lords that soundings that we have made suggest that a number of very senior judges who work in the criminal field are of the view that it would be helpful to keep this section in. We think that there are also significant presentational advantages in making it clear to criminal justice agencies and, perhaps, even to the general public, that previous convictions and the other kind of information that is relevant and lawful to be taken into account by a sentencing judge are very relevant to the assessment of risk. We believe that it is transparent&#151;it is there in the statute&#151;and we believe that it encourages confidence.</p>

<a name="80430-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08043096000145"></a>Those are the arguments that the Government put in suggesting that, on balance, it would be advisable to keep this part of Section 229 on the statute book.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08043096000267"></a> Clause 28, page 20, line 9, at end insert &#147;subject to the agreement of a Crown Court judge&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08043096000155"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6 to 10. Amendments Nos. 5 to 9 refer to what is now Clause 28, which must be one of the most opaque clauses in the Bill and, when the Bill becomes law, it will become one the most opaque sections on the statute book. It deals with three distinct classes of offenders.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08043096000156"></a>The first group concerns offenders serving a determinate sentence for offences that are neither violent nor of a sexual nature. The second group concerns those who have received determinate sentences where they are serving sentences for crimes of a sexual or violent nature, or have been assessed as unsuitable for automatic re-release because they present a risk of serious harm. The third and final category covers those offenders who have committed sexual or violent offences and who are serving extended sentences.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08043096000157"></a>In the case of the first category of offenders, if they have been assessed as not presenting any risk of harm to the public and are recalled, the Bill stipulates that they will be in prison for a fixed period of 28 days, at which time they will automatically be re-released. Clause 28 gives the Government power by statutory instrument to alter the figure of 28 days. Two of our amendments seek to remove the power that is available to the Government in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08043096000158"></a>In the case of the two other categories of prisoner to which I have referred, the Bill gives the Secretary of State and, in certain circumstances, the Parole Board the power to take decisions about the prisoner&#146;s release. Other amendments in our group affecting Clause 28&#151;Amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 8&#151;seek to insert an extra decision-maker in decisions about release; a Crown Court judge. We believe that it is wrong that decisions about the fate of such prisoners should lie solely in the hands of the Executive. We believe that someone who is properly qualified, outside the Executive, should also play a part in the decision-making process. That is why we propose to add to the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000291"></a>&#147;subject to the agreement of a Crown Court judge&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80430-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08043096000159"></a>There is one other amendment in the group, Amendment No. 10; it refers to Clause 30. It concerns the recall of those offenders who have received a life sentence but who are now out on licence. Once again, the Bill gives the discretion to recall those former prisoners to the Secretary of State and, in certain circumstances, to the Parole Board. A recent decision of the Court of Appeal suggested that the Parole Board, at least in certain circumstances, is not independent of the Secretary of State. Once again, we believe that another party should be involved in decisions about those who have received a life sentence but who are now out on licence. In this case, our amendment inserts a reference to the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08043096000160"></a>The background to these amendments was very fully debated in Committee and I do not propose to say anything further in support of them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="08043096000161"></a><a name="80430-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80430-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08043096000852"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for tabling the amendments. These are important matters and they allow us to debate the provisions of the Bill relating to the release and recall of prisoners. Amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 8, amending Clause 28, have the effect that, where recalled determinate-sentence prisoners have been assessed by the Secretary of State as safe to re-release, there would be a requirement for their cases to be referred to the Crown Court so that the court could review that decision.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08043096000162"></a>Our main concern at this proposal is that it would place a substantial added burden on the Courts Service. To give some indication of the scale of this burden, in 2007-08 the Parole Board conducted over 14,000 recall reviews. We are also of the opinion that the process for dealing with such referrals would be slow and bureaucratic. Prior to 1999, all recalls in respect of prisoners serving less than four years had to be pursued through the courts. It was a more complex process which was rarely used, but it was one of the reasons why we extended executive recall provisions in the first place. We are not convinced that the proposal would enhance public protection in any significant way.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08043096000163"></a>I remind the House that prisoners serving sentences for sexual or violent offences are automatically precluded from being given a fixed-term or 28-day recall. Those serving sentences for offences other than sex or violence can be given a fixed-term recall only if they are assessed as not presenting a risk of serious harm.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08043096000164"></a>I also remind the House that all recalled prisoners have a right to have the recall decision reviewed by the independent Parole Board, thus providing offenders with a means of redress. Our recall provisions are designed, frankly, to reduce the burden on the Parole Board and on the Prison Service and will assist in achieving our objective to focus prison and the Parole Board&#146;s resources on the most dangerous offenders. We have carefully considered the noble Lord&#146;s amendments but I am afraid we cannot accept them.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08043096000165"></a>Amendment No. 10 seeks to amend Clause 30 in respect of the recall of life and indeterminate-sentence prisoners. I can assure the House that we recognise that recalling a life-sentence prisoner has potentially serious consequences. It could result in the offender spending the rest of his or her life in custody. That is why such decisions are not taken lightly and why all such decisions are subject to review by the Parole Board. Amendment No. 10 requires all recalls of life or indeterminate-sentence prisoners to have the approval of a judge.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08043096000166"></a>We fear that this amendment would build a potential source of delay in the recall process, during which further serious crime could, unfortunately, be committed. The purpose of recall action is to enable the Secretary of State to take swift and preventive action in removing potentially dangerous offenders from the community. We think it is a crucial means of public protection. The current provisions for the recall of a life-sentence prisoner&#151;this is an important  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_259"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue but I shall be as quick as I can&#151;are to be found in Section 32 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. That section provides two routes for recall. Section 32(1) enables the Secretary of State to recall, having first consulted the Parole Board and received a positive recommendation. But Section 32(2) enables the Secretary of State to recall a life-sentence prisoner without prior consultation with the board where it is,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000292"></a>&#147;expedient in the public interest to recall that person before such a recommendation is practicable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08043096000257"></a>The clear inference of the statute as it now stands is that in the majority of cases a lifer recall will be pursued through the Section 32(1) route&#151;the Parole Board route&#151;and that the Secretary of State will recall a lifer without prior consultation with the Parole Board only where such consultation is not possible in an individual case.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08043096000167"></a>The House will know that for life-sentence prisoners released into the community on life licence, the threshold for recall is high. An increased risk of reoffending by itself is not sufficient to warrant recalling them to prison. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the prisoner presents an unacceptable risk to life and limb. To warrant a life or indeterminate sentence it follows that a prisoner will have been convicted of the most serious sexual or violent offences. When their conduct has deteriorated to such a degree that they are assessed as presenting an unacceptable risk to life or limb, it is invariably in the interests of public protection that the recall process facilitates their swift removal from the community.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08043096000168"></a>In practice therefore, nearly all recalls are effected administratively as we speak. We accept that there is no limit on the number of cases that may be decided under the public expediency recall procedure&#151;that is, Section 32(2), which gives the Secretary of State his powers. However, the spirit of the legislation leans towards the primary mechanism for deciding to recall a lifer through a Parole Board recommendation. But in the period from October 2002 to March 2007 more than 80 per cent of decisions to recall lifers were made without a Parole Board recommendation. I can reassure the House that those decisions have been entirely correct in law on the basis that it was expedient in the public interest for the Secretary of State to exercise his power of executive recall without consulting the Parole Board.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08043096000169"></a>Nevertheless, we are concerned to ensure that the statutory framework reflects current operational practice, and that the operational practice could not be seen as undermining Parliament&#146;s intention. For that reason, Clause 30 places our current operational practice on a firm statutory footing. We also recognise that it is critical that there are strong and effective safeguards in place to ensure that the decision taken by the executive is open to challenge by the offender, and even if not challenged, is open to robust scrutiny by an independent body. That is what the review by the Parole Board achieves.</p>

<a name="80430-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08043096000170"></a>The Parole Board will invariably have an oral hearing to consider the representations of life-sentence prisoners. Such hearings are normally chaired by a judicial member. The prisoner is entitled to be present, legally represented, and to call witnesses. The board has the power to direct the prisoner&#146;s immediate re-release if it is satisfied

This is a question of balance and we recognise that it is important to strike the right one between being able to take swift, preventive action to protect the public on the one hand, and ensuring that such decisions are subject to robust scrutiny. That is why we believe that putting Clause 30 into the Bill is the appropriate measure to achieve that balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08043096000171"></a>I can be shorter and more helpful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on his two remaining Amendments Nos. 6 and 9. They would remove the power to amend the period of time an offender must serve before being automatically re-released if given a fixed-term recall or the period other recalled offenders must serve before the Secretary of State must refer their case to the Parole Board.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08043096000197"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, there are many things in these clauses about extreme pornography with which we on these Benches remain deeply unhappy. On Report, the Minister did not explain why he could not move at least a little nearer the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Linking these clauses to that Act would have made the measure more objective, and less subjective, and would have had the other strength of targeting the producers of such material rather than the end user. It would target those who are making vast amounts of money out it.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08043096000198"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, had a suggestion, but the Government did not take up, to make it illegal for credit card companies to allow the spend on extreme porn sites. I thought that was a constructive suggestion that the Government had not chosen to pursue.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08043096000199"></a>The other reason to link these clauses to the Obscene Publications Act is that that is a tried and tested definition in court. It talks of material that tends to &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; as opposed to &#147;extreme&#148;, which the Minister admitted at Report stage is a very subjective judgment. It is something that he does not like.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08043096000200"></a>I appreciate that the Minister feels that &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; is old-fashioned language and not suitable, but it has stood the test of time in court for printed material and it addresses what the Government say they are trying to do with these clauses. The Government want to stop people becoming depraved and corrupted and therefore more likely to commit criminal acts. I will come back to whether there is enough evidence of that&#151;and I will contend that anyway. The legislation as drafted does simply allows the word &#147;extreme&#148;. Although theBill defines that word, when a case comes to court it is going to give juries a great deal of difficulty when they start to look at it in any detail.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08043096000201"></a>The legislation allows the police to pick up someone watching this material before they commit any crime, before they actually cause any harm to another person. The Government may be right that the person might have gone on to commit such a crime, but often they may be arresting somebody who has strange tastes, ones we might find repugnant, but who is never going to harm anyone else and is no threat to society. Their life is likely to be ruined by the subsequent court case, even if it fails or if the accused is successfully produces one of the defences. That is truly the domain of the thought police. These clauses are the state entering the bedrooms and minds of citizens before they commit any crime that involves harm to another human being.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08043096000202"></a>I know that the Minister will again quote the evidence. However, the academic world is not of one voice on the effects of this material. A number of academic studies quoted by the Minister show that extreme pornography may affect violent criminals&#151;people who had criminal intent in the first place. On the other hand, he could have chosen to quote from Professor Todd Kendall who presented his paper to Stanford Law School. It showed that as the United States brought in access to the internet at a different rate in  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_264"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 50 states&#151;not intentionally&#151;a 10 per cent increase in internet access yielded a 7.3 per cent decrease in reported rapes. The purpose of quoting that is to show that different academic studies show different things.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08043096000203"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 15, which concerns the tariffs. Will the Minister explain why the tariffs are as they are for simply watching an act, when committing the act results in a lesser or equal tariff? Surely it is much worse to commit an act under the Sexual Offences Act than to watch it on the internet. I want also to ask him about the guidance that he will issue to the police. How on earth are the police going to enforce this law? Will it be by random raids on people&#146;s bedroom, by reports from neighbours or by trawling through hacked internet access? Policing this area will be a nightmare when it comes to otherwise law-abiding citizens watching alone or with their partners things that we may find distasteful or even disgusting. This affects an awful lot of British citizens. I have no way of telling whether extreme or just ordinary pornography is involved, but internet service providers estimate that about &#163;1 billion a year is spent on pornography.

It would have been to set up a government website that allowed the reporting on non-consensual abusive acts, slightly along the lines of Crimestoppers. That would have allowed users to report anything truly criminal or suspect and would have led to the arrest of genuine sexual offenders from whichever country they originated. That idea could be put into practice and would be very cost-effective.</p>

On Report, I spoke about the Video Recordings Act 1984. I did not repeat one of the juiciest pieces about it. Until that time, we had a British Board of Film Censors, which was not a censorship board. It classified films, and if it refused to classify them, they could still be shown with the permission of local authorities. The Video Recordings Act 1984 changed the board from being a classification board to being a censorship board because if a video recording was not approved by the board, it could not be shown at all. From being a classification board, it became a censorship board, but its name changed from being a censorship board to a classification board. George Orwell would have been proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08043096000208"></a>I am enthusiastic about Amendment No. 13 because it seeks to get round the horrible situation which the Government are putting us in by adding an extra gloss to the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08043096000209"></a>I am less enthusiastic about Amendment No. 15, not because it is not right in itself, but because I simply do not believe that any jury will convict a citizen of this country for possessing what it is not illegal to produce. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, gave the reason of needing inspectors with the right of entry to people&#146;s homes, sitting rooms, bedrooms, video machines and DVDs. Is that really what the Government are proposing? There is no other way of enforcing it. If they succeed in doing it, however they succeed in doing it, what jury is going to convict people for possessing what it is not illegal to produce? The Government, despite all the sincerity of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, have failed to answer any of these arguments.</p>

In other words, they should be taken out of the Bill. I hoped that your Lordships would have had an opportunity to debate both sides of the concern that lay behind those amendments.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08043096000211"></a>The human rights aspect was rightly aired. However distasteful to many, including myself, if people choose to watch extreme or kinky pornography in the privacy of their own home, and that is not breaking the law, the state should not be involved. It was argued by the organisation backlash, among others, that this law as currently drafted is likely to criminalise hundreds of thousands of people who use violent pornographic images as part of consensual sexual relationships. It also argues that some of the RAE research was inaccurate and biased. The other, equally important, concern is whether extreme pornography could be harmful, in the sense of generally brutalising, to citizens. I am reminded of when I was asked to watch an experiment at the LSE with two groups of undergraduates. One group watched some rather violent material, and the other was shown, gradually, up to a point, fairly placid stuff. At that point, they were both shown some pretty violent stuff. The first lot, who had got used to seeing what they were shown&#151;rather more violent stuff&#151;did not react at all, while the other group was horrified. That is quite important.</p>

<a name="80430-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08043096000212"></a>Of far greater concern, as has been mentioned, is the possible effect on sick or vulnerable people who might fantasise about what they are viewing and go on to commit violent crime against members of the public. That was argued forcefully in the other place by Martin Salter MP, quoting the case of Jane Longhurst. In most cases, as we know, these offences are committed against women. Both areas of concern combine to make a strong case for a far more professional look at this whole subject, not least in view of the growing use

No doubt, if we had followed the Minister&#146;s advice and gone to the police station to see the evidence that he had to endure, that would have graphically confirmed my view.</p>

It is a growth area of citizen concern which will not go away.</p>

Was it to discourage criminal sexual acts being filmed, or was it to discourage people from watching porn? The Minister&#146;s answer was something of a surprise: he wished to criminalise the gratification of the individual in watching pornography in the privacy of his own home. That is one thing, but it seems completely illogical to make that a more serious offence than the act which&#151;if it is criminal&#151;the individual is watching. I ask the Minister to reflect on whether he can in any form of logic maintain his opposition to these amendments.</p>

I think that the law will be brought into disrepute if the Government persist. I, too, support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.

I can almost guarantee that after the next general election, when I might be sitting on that side of the House and other Members might be sitting on this, I will make exactly the same criticism of an incoming Conservative Government. It is a habit which Governments find it irresistible to resist. But the logic of what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, and the expressed views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I have the honour to sit, support that position.

As a member of Oxford City Council in the 1970s I well recall Alderman Fagg chairing a sub-committee of the estates committee which viewed these films on Monday morning at 10 o&#146;clock. I confess that we debated these matters and that I argued that there should be no censorship of any film and it was all unnecessary. Well, I have changed my mind.

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08043096000230"></a>The noble Baroness asked me to explain in detail why the Obscene Publications Act and its definitions were not used in the formulation of this clause. This legislation has been proposed because the controls in the Obscene Publications Act are much more easily evaded these days by the use of modern technology, namely the internet, which makes it much easier to use and distribute and therefore easier to possess. As most such extreme material is hosted abroad, controls on publication and distribution are no longer sufficient.</p>

I was trying to answer the first question posed as to why we are bringing forward this legislation at all. The second question, relating to the noble Baroness&#146;s first group of amendments, is why we have not we have not used the Obscene Publications Act. Her amendment removes the element of the offence which requires that an extreme pornographic image depicts an extreme image and replaces it with a reference to the definition of &#147;obscene&#148;; namely, the &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test, which, as she says, is found in Section 1 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Her amendment also has the effect of rendering redundant subsections (6) and (7). Those subsections set out the,</p>
<ul><a name="08043096000293"></a>&#147;grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene nature&#148;, </ul>
<p><a name="08043096000258"></a>test and the list of extreme acts. The amendment has the effect of opening up the offence to all obscene pornography. It would no longer be limited to certain specified depictions of threatening, violent, bestiality or necrophilia images.

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08043096000233"></a>My officials and the department, when considering this matter over the months that it has taken to prepare the Bill, saw the initial attraction of linking this possession offence to the existing publication offence. Under the Obscene Publications Act, whether material is obscene depends on whether it would deprave and corrupt those most likely to read, see or hear it. That &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test works by reference to the likely audience. In the context of possession there is no audience. Directly importing the deprave&#151;</p>

The possible perverse consequence of that could be that less sexually aware members of society become more at risk of committing an offence than habitual users of pornography. So it is clear that the test would have to be adapted. It is not a simple case of referencing. We explored the feasibility of adapting the Obscene Publications Act but concluded that our approach is to be preferred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08043096000236"></a>The Obscene Publications Act offence is not limited to specified material, but, rather, catches anything which passes the &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test.

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08043096000237"></a>As the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has the effect of rendering redundant the subsection (7) list of specified acts, it opens up the clause to cover a much broader range of pornography&#151;anything which could pass the &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test. I am advised that it could catch the depiction of degrading sexual acts such as drinking urine or smearing excrement on a person&#146;s body. In that respect, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment might widen the offence significantly.</p>

<p><a name="08043096000259"></a>are synonymous with the wording of the &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test. Rather&#151;I repeat the points that I have made at earlier stages&#151;it is that the three elements of the offence, the &#147;pornography&#148; test, the &#147;explicit realistic extreme act&#148; test and the &#147;grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character&#148; test, when taken together, should ensure that the offence captures only material which it would be illegal to publish by virtue of the &#147;deprave and corrupt&#148; test within the Obscene Publications Act.</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08043096000239"></a>Amendment No. 15 would reduce the maximum prison sentence available to Crown Courts to deal with the possession of material described in Clause 62(7)(a) and (b) from three years to two years, making it the same as the maximum penalty proposed for bestiality and necrophilia material falling under Clause 62(7)(c) and (d). I have listened carefully to the points raised on this. In considering the penalties for these offences, it is clear that we have considered carefully proportionality with regard to existing criminal offences. We certainly think it right that the maximum penalty for possession of extreme pornographic material should fall below that available for the more serious offence of possession of indecent photographs of children, which is five years maximum. It should fall below also that available for publication, distribution and possession for gain offences under the Obscene Publications Act, which in Clause 69, as your Lordships will be aware, we are raising from three to five years. These are also more serious offences. Further, the penalties should

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08043096000240"></a>The sentencing levels that we propose are proportionate, bearing in mind the high threshold levels for this offence. I stress that we are not talking about the kind of soft porn to which many noble Lords have referred and which has been referred to in the letters and e-mails that I have received in the past few weeks. It is material that should not be in circulation in this country. I say again that the increased availability of this material is a direct result of the impracticality in the internet age of controlling its circulation by targeting the publishers under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. We think it right to give the courts the means to reflect greater concern about the material featuring extreme sexual violence, whether real or simulated, than is the case for material which is degrading but non-violent. That is the reason for the distinction in the maximum penalties between the categories set out in Clause 62(7).</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08043096000241"></a>There are two other points to be made on the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment to the penalty provision. First, her amendment removes, perhaps inadvertently, the capacity of the Crown Courts to impose a fine. Secondly, it deletes the transitional provision of subsection (4), which is required to provide for future changes to the sentencing powers of magistrates&#146; courts in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08043096000242"></a>On the issue of policing, I hope that I can reassure noble Lords. The police have welcomed this offence. They see it as a further means to take illegal material out of circulation and an additional tool to deal with individuals whose behaviour may be causing concern. This is not, I suggest, a case of policing the bedroom. It is intended to target only the most extreme pornography. We believe that the number of prosecutions will be relatively small, but my understanding&#151;from advice that I have received&#151;is that the offence will be a valuable additional resource for officers already working on protecting the public in this area. I also give an assurance that this offence will not be commenced before a full explanation of it is given to the police and to the courts.</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08043096000243"></a>I am aware that this area is controversial. We discussed the principle on Report, and I hope that I have, at the very least, provided some explanation to the noble Baroness of the approach that the Government have taken. She will now have to consider her position.</p>

This difficult area is one that I would have found it lonely to do alone, so I particularly thank your Lordships for expanding&#151;better than I can, in all cases&#151;on why these clauses are, in our view, particularly unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08043096000245"></a>As the Minister says, we dealt with the principle on Report, so the point of coming back at Third Reading is to offer the Government a small chance to make these clauses slightly less unworkable&#151;and slightly

I am particularly glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, has joined the House at this point. She has spoken before about how difficult juries find this issue, and obviously has wide experience of why that is so.</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08043096000246"></a>This really comes down to the contention that these clauses are, as the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, said, put there to send a signal more than anything else. There was great consensus that they are really unworkable and do not address the issue that the Government are trying to address here. Perhaps the most chilling point in the Minister&#146;s summing up&#151;I thank him for going into some detail&#151;was that when it came to policing this it was for dealing &#147;with individuals&#148; who are &#147;causing concern&#148;. Well, that is pretty difficult. How are they causing concern if they have committed no crime yet? They might be causing concern in all sorts of ways; they might be individuals whom the police do not much like, for a number of reasons, but then they get raided. Again, that really makes me feel worried. This is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, said, all to do with human rights. It would have been better to look at this in the cool light of day. I am sorry that the Minister has resisted the idea. I know that he cannot call for it, but he could put on the pressure to create a Select Committee to look at the whole issue of violence in the media. That, I think, is what really concerns noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80430-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08043096000247"></a>I hope that, in this instance, the Conservative Benches will indicate whether they support these poorly drafted and unworkable clauses. I have a feeling that, should I test the opinion of the House, they will simply abstain. That would be a pity, as they are usually strong on trying to improve a Bill as the Liberal Democrat Benches are trying to today. It is quite clear that we feel there is still room for improvement. For that reason, I beg leave to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<a name="80430-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080430104000022"></a>To address the concerns raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, I made a commitment on Report to bring forward amendments so that an interim order could be made only in the absence of the individual in respect of whom the order has been applied for, if the court is satisfied that the individual has been given reasonable notice of the application and the court hearing date. Such a requirement would ensure that the individual could attend the hearing or make representations on that day if he or she chose to do so. Amendment No. 20 fulfils that commitment.</p>

The amendments also ensure that hospital orders, restriction orders and supervision orders made by the courts under all relevant legislation are included in the definition of these terms.

It is perfectly true, of course, that the more serious offences&#151;we know that many such offences are committed on NHS premises and against NHS personnel&#151;can be dealt with quite adequately under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The beauty of Clause 117 is that one can intervene at a much earlier stage to prevent what might be a very serious fracas developing. I welcome, as does the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, the fact that this measure has now been extended to Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080430104000038"></a>Whether this is NHS legislation that borders on the criminal, or criminal legislation that borders on the NHS is a somewhat moot jurisprudential point. It does not really matter. Massive executive responsibilities in relation to the NHS have been with Wales ever since the devolution process of 1964 began. They were devolved, after 1998, to make this matter the prerogative of the Welsh Assembly in relation to executive decisions. Now we have Part 3 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, in Schedule 5 of which NHS functions belong to an area where the Welsh Assembly could initiate a procedure that would enable an Order in Council to grant it a swathe of authority and jurisdiction. As yet, it has not done so. In a perfect world, I would love to have seen the Welsh Assembly take this initiative, provided of course that the provisions came into force no later than the provisions in this Act. There is no earthly reason why NHS personnel in Wales, vulnerable as they are, should not have the same protection as they have in every other part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80430-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080430104000039"></a>I make a slightly technical, constitutional point here. During the passage of the 2006 measure through this House, an undertaking was given which, I think, was the equivalent of an undertaking given in the context of Scotland: that there would be a convention whereby this House, although of the parent Parliament, would have absolute sovereign authority to intervene in any matter relating to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but would not do so in regard to any function that either had been transferred or was intended to be transferred. Therefore, in future, I very much hope that the initiatives will come from the Welsh Assembly Government themselves. I think there are three matters in the pipeline now, one already having been passed by this House. Under Part 3, I understand there are about 20 more on the shopping list, and they take quite some time to be heard. I very much hope that the Welsh Assembly will, in so far as it is practicable, take those initiatives. I trust that this House will be loyal&#151;I am certain that it will be&#151;to that undertaking that it will intervene in such matters only at the request of the Welsh Assembly.</p>

These amendments, tabled by the Government, are extremely important because they ensure that the Assembly will have parity with the powers that will exist in England. They also have the sophistication to allow the powers to be triggered at the decision of the Ministers in the Assembly.

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="080430110000018"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we come to the special immigration status which is dealt with in Part 10 of the Bill. If I may, I will first get it on the record that the amendments that were moved in Committee and on Report were not for the exclusive benefit of the Afghans but for everybody who is to be consigned indefinitely to the special immigration status defined in this part of the Bill. We were concentrating mainly on the Afghans because they were the people on whom we had detailed information. Of the other 38 people who are likely to be designated under the special immigration status, their cases were not in the public domain. The Minister raised the curtain briefly to allow us to glimpse the particular case of Mr A of the Justice and Equality Movement in Darfur who may, or may not, come under Article 1F. But neither he nor Mr B, a former member of the AWB in South Africa, had been tried. In the case of Mr A, the &#147;serious reasons for believing&#148; that he had done any of the specified acts in the exclusions appeared to rest on his standing in the JEM, which had committed war crimes in Darfur. It is an extension of Article 1F to say that it is going to apply to every single individual who is taking part in an organisation that has been labelled as having committed war crimes.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="080430110000019"></a>My approach today is not to cross swords with the Minister on the interpretation of the convention of one Act in particular, but to try to see if we can reach an accommodation by looking at this status from a common-sense point of view. A person who is designated will be denied the right to work and access to mainstream benefits&#151;to the end of his life in many cases, because the situation in his country of origin will make it impossible for him ever to be returned for ECHR reasons. That may continue not just for a few years but, as we see from looking at the examples&#151;particularly for the Afghans&#151;more or less into the indefinite future.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080430110000020"></a>These amendments say that in passing this indeterminate sentence, the Secretary of State will have to consider whether the person constitutes a danger to the community in this country. If not, he is able&#151;as we have discussed already on two occasions&#151;to grant six months&#146; leave to remain. That can be renewed from time to time, until a final decision can be made. But after a number of years, when it becomes clear that there is no prospect whatever of returning the person, and even more that he has become settled in the UK with a wife and children who would also be exempted from designation by these amendments, it would be reasonable to grant him indefinite leave to remain.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080430110000021"></a>The Minister said that, in the case of the Afghans, although the wives were to be treated in line with the principal applicant, it was open to them to apply for asylum separately. As he knows, they have done so without getting responses for several years. Meanwhile, children have been born here and, in many cases, have acquired British citizenship. The longer the families are here, the closer their ties with the UK and the more intolerable it would be to pack them off to Afghanistan, or wherever, in the improbable event that circumstances there would make it possible for them to be returned without ECHR risk. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="080430110000022"></a><a name="80430-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80430-0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080430110000730"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for bringing the House&#146;s attention back to the provisions relating to the special immigration status. The first of these amendments would introduce an additional condition which would have to be satisfied in order for someone to be treated as a foreign criminal for the purposes of Clause 128. In addition to being someone who has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or who has been given a custodial sentence of any length for one of the offences listed in the order made under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, or who is excluded from refugee status by virtue of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention, a person would be a &#147;foreign criminal&#148;, and hence liable to designation, only if, in addition, the Secretary of State certifies that he or she constitutes a danger to the community. I do not consider that additional restriction appropriate, and I am therefore unable to accept this amendment.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080430110000023"></a>Why? I remind noble Lords that the new special immigration status is intended to apply primarily to foreign criminals as defined in this clause who are liable to deportation, but who cannot currently be removed for human rights reasons. They are people who we would want to remove from the United Kingdom if we possibly could. We would seek to remove the person concerned whether or not he or she represented a continuing danger to the community. Special immigration status, as the phrase suggests, is an immigration measure. It is not about public protection.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080430110000024"></a>The test for deportation in Section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Immigration Act is that the Secretary of State deems the person&#146;s deportation to be conducive to the public good. That test can be met on the basis of the person&#146;s past conduct alone, irrespective of whether or not they represent a continuing danger to the community.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080430110000025"></a>Let us take the hypothetical example of someone who has committed a serious offence and has served a lengthy custodial sentence well in excess of the two-year threshold. It may be that on their release they are no longer a danger to the community. Indeed, if the person concerned has been given a life sentence, the Parole Board will not recommend the person&#146;s release if they consider that he or she is still a danger to the community. We might nevertheless wish to deport that person, and, if we are unable to do so for human rights reasons, we would wish to be able to designate them under this part of the Bill. In the case of someone who is excluded from refugee status by virtue of Article 1F, the point may be even more starkly defined.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080430110000026"></a>Where a person is guilty of a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, their ability to commit the crime is quite often linked to their status or position in the country where the crime occurred. Once they are in the United Kingdom, they will normally have lost that status or position, and, even if they have not, they are very unlikely to constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom. For example, Mr A&#151;mentioned by the noble Lord&#151;the founder member of the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement whose case I mentioned on Report, posed no danger to the community of the United Kingdom. Again, it is  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>likely that we would wish to deport such a person. If we are unable to do so for a human rights reason, we would want to be able to designate them under these provisions.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080430110000027"></a>The Government&#146;s position is that it should be possible to deny foreign criminals as defined by this clause immigration leave, and prevent them establishing ties which may make their removal at a later date, when things change, more difficult, whether or not they constitute a current danger to the community. Their past actions alone would be sufficient grounds for taking deportation action. However, since they cannot be deported at the present time, we say that the same test&#151;that is, the individual&#146;s past actions, without any attempt to assess whether or not they continue to pose a danger to the community&#151;should apply to designation for the purposes of special immigration status.</p>
<a name="time_14"></a>
<a name="80430-0008.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="080430110000198"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080430110000028"></a>I am aware that the provisions of Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 require there to be consideration of whether the person constitutes a danger to the community. While we have drawn on the provisions of that section to set the threshold for some of the conditions which may result in a person being designated under Part 10, the two are not an exact parallel. It is important to note that their position is very different from those who would be liable for designation for special immigration status.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080430110000029"></a>Section 72 applies for the purpose of the construction of Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention, and it is Article 33(2) which requires this assessment to be made. The reason for that is that Article 33(2) permits signatory states to return a refugee to a country where he fears persecution. That is obviously a serious step to take, which is why Article 33(2) requires that the refugee must not only have been convicted of a particularly serious crime but must constitute a danger to the community in the country of refuge in order for removal to take place.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080430110000030"></a>In the case of special immigration status, we would not be removing an individual to face possible persecution. The status is designed for those who we accept can not be removed for human rights reasons and does not apply to recognised refugees. That is fundamentally different from the application of Article 33(2).</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080430110000031"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 46 relating to the introduction of an appeal mechanism. I have technical concerns about the operation of the proposed appeal arrangements, which I will cover briefly before turning to issue of principle.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080430110000032"></a>First, any appeal against certification would be to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. There is no provision for an appeal to be transferred to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, as might happen in the case of an appeal against an immigration decision.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080430110000033"></a>Secondly, as drafted, the amendment provides for an appeal against certification and for an appeal against a refusal to revoke the certificate. There would be nothing to prevent someone who had been designated appealing against certification, losing that appeal, and applying immediately for the certificate to be revoked with a further right of appeal if that is refused. If that  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_285"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appeal is also unsuccessful, there would be nothing to prevent a further application for the certificate to be revoked. Even though we have said that we expect the number of cases where the new power will be used to be small, the possibility of successive applications and appeals represents a potential waste of resources in terms of time, money and people.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080430110000034"></a>It has been the Government&#146;s position throughout the passage of the Bill that a free-standing right of appeal is unnecessary and that judicial review provides an appropriate vehicle for challenging any decision to designate. Under the provisions as currently drafted, once the Bill comes into force a person who has been designated will be able to bring a judicial review on the grounds that the decision to designate is unlawful, unreasonable, procedurally unfair or incompatible with their ECHR rights. In our view, this provides an adequate safeguard and is preferable to introducing a new appeal mechanism with multiple layers of litigation.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080430110000035"></a>My principal objection is not to the deficiencies of the proposed appeal mechanism. The Government have made their position clear: we believe it should be possible to designate people with the new status simply on the grounds of what they have done in the past, and that it is unhelpful and unnecessary to introduce the additional requirement to assess whether or not they currently represent a danger to the community. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="080430110000036"></a><a name="80430-0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80430-0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080430110000731"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, the Minister addressed the question of appeals as if Amendment No. 46 referred to appeals against designation whereas it is, of course, related to Amendment No. 45, which provides for certification. The appeal in Amendment No. 46 deals with the appeals on the Secretary of State&#146;s certification in Amendment No. 45. I hope that the Minister will recognise that his argument did not apply pari passu to what we are proposing under these two amendments.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080430110000037"></a>All that is not really the point because we are talking about whether there should be that procedure for certification in addition to any other conditions that are imposed. I must say that we have not been successful in trying to compromise, as I had hoped.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080430110000038"></a>The Minister did not address what I had said about families, particularly wives and children, who are left in a state of limbo indefinitely under the proposals in the Bill. The Minister knows that we have had reason to complain several times because his assurances that they had power to appeal, and that they would be considered in the normal way, have not been satisfied in practice. The four wives and children whose applications were treated in line with those of the Afghan hijackers&#151;we are using them as examples and not as exclusive cases that we mean the decision to rest on&#151;have not been considered properly as individual applicants but are still waiting after eight years for several cases to be considered.</p>

<a name="80430-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080430110000039"></a>I am dissatisfied with the Minister&#146;s answer and, although I accept that the drafting is not perfect, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080430110000047"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s amendment proposed changing the definition of industrial action from action that affects,</p>

<p><a name="080430110000133"></a>to action that puts,</p>

We have tabled the amendment as it its now drafted to resolve any uncertainties resulting from generic terms such as &#147;staff&#148;, but in substance the amendment reflects the proposals of the noble Earl. It redefines industrial action as,</p>

What I must do is say thank you to the noble Lord.

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080430110000052"></a>The three services&#151;the Armed Forces, the Prison Service and the police&#151;are all the subjects, or will be by the time this legislation goes through, of mandatory no-strike agreements. Therefore, there is an onus on the Government to ensure that their interests, which are held by the independent review bodies, are protected. The review bodies already have a clear remit as to what they have to take into account in coming to their decisions. That includes affordability, as defined by their funding departments. The Minister will recall that last year the Government staged the implementation of a pay review. This was the first time that they had not followed the review body&#146;s recommendations. We argue that the consequence of short-changing members of these vital services is very serious indeed. The actions last year resulted in the threatened prison officers&#146; strike later this month, and the highly unusual police march on Parliament. The Government need to put themselves in a position of explaining their actions to Members of Parliament and having those actions approved by them by a formal resolution. I beg to move.</p>

Independent arbiters, as we have heard, awarded a 2.5 per cent pay award and the Home Secretary can have been left in no doubt about the anger of police officers on the day of their massively successful, well-ordered and well-mannered protest march on 23 January 2008. It was attended by 25,000 off-duty officers. We know that the Police Federation has gone to judicial review; we await the outcome of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="080430110000054"></a>The office of constable is a protected one and has been for almost 100 years since police officers accepted a no-strike clause. How that office has been badly used by the Home Secretary&#146;s decision to override years of clear understanding on all sides that an agreement made by an independent body should be binding. It always was and it always should be. When I was a member of the Police Negotiating Board, some years ago in the time of the previous Government and this one, we all worked hard to maintain that position. It is desperately sad for me to see how this long-standing agreement has been completely overturned without any consultation and absolutely no real understanding of the views of front-line police officers who, day to day, give their services to protect us all.</p>

Effectively, a police officer is always on duty. Officers do lots of horrible work. They are hands-on at accidents, deaths and assaults on themselves and others. They really do not feel that

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a><a name="080430110000174"></a>&#147;The appointment of a pay review body has been used over and again to take the sting out of an industrial conflict.

My noble friend Lady Hanham mentioned the disturbing sight of the police demonstrating. That sight terrified me because it brings the forces of law into political play. That is very dangerous. One of the reasons for the 1688 glorious revolution was the fear of standing armies. That is the flipside of the coin when police or soldiery take political action. For that reason, above all, with the police, the Prison Service and the Army, the Government ought to accept binding arbitration. If they are not going to accept binding arbitration, they should explain to the House of Commons why they have not done so. To think otherwise is extremely dangerous.</p>

It gives me no pleasure to say this because I am a government Peer. Having said that, the amendment seems to be a matter for resolution in the House of Commons, not this House. For that reason alone, I shall abstain. I would have voted against the amendment. It is a financial matter and should properly be dealt with in the other place. I shall abstain on this basis, but I agree entirely that the Government have not taken the high ground on this. The right to strike was taken away, quite rightly, in 1919. The police are in a special position as are the other services. We should value that and honour independent arbitration. For that reason, I shall abstain.</p>

One of the reasons for doing that was that the police had indeed gone on strike in various places, notably London and Liverpool, but in a number of other urban areas as well. This country was faced with the vision and reality of troops with fixed bayonets going onto the streets of Liverpool and a warship sailing up the Mersey and training its guns on the rioters on the shore in Liverpool. That is the sort of horror story that the 1919 Act sought to remove. We have moved very fast away from that to a position where the police serve this country loyally and steadfastly, despite the fact that their pay and allowances have oscillated over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080430110000060"></a>In 1979 the Lord Edmund-Davies review, looking at the parlous state then of police pay and allowances, brought in for the first time the concept of a basket of  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_291"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occupations, as it was called in those days, against which police pay and allowances should be measured on an annual basis. From that time until very recently, police pay and allowances have been good and have been reflected in the way recruiting is carried out. I will set out what has happened quite recently. In 1979 there was the Lord Edmund-Davies review, with the basket of occupations. That basket of occupations was changed arbitrarily by the Government in, I think, 2006, changing the occupational constitution of that basket to something which, quite clearly, would produce a lower pay review. That review, on the most recent sounding, produced a 2.8 per cent increase. That was not good enough for the Government, who went to arbitration. Both sides signed up to binding arbitration and the arbitration level, if I remember rightly, was 2.5 per cent. The Government settled at 1.9 per cent. We are really slicing this; the principle is not about the amounts involved, which were quite small. They would have been nice to have, but it was not that much of an issue. The issue was the fact that the principle, which has already been spoken about very eloquently in your Lordships' House, had been breached.</p>

<a name="80430-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080430110000061"></a>The Government&#146;s action on this last occasion drove a coach and four straight through all those principles of trust, respect and support, which a uniformed service has had and needs to have in the Government of this country. The police feel deeply let down and believe that they have been thrown to one side. I am sorry to give marginal percentage points, but the 1.9 per cent sits very uncomfortably with the 2.5 per cent that was given to police support staff. So, in this philosophical way, you have police officers walking on the streets with civilian police support officers who are getting more money because they have the right to strike. The principle speaks for itself. I warmly and wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

Clearly, I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter again, which we last debated in Committee.

That is very simply the Government&#146;s position. Although the focus of the amendment and the debate is on the police and prison officers, they are not alone in having independent pay machinery which makes recommendations to Ministers. I emphasise the words, &#147;recommendations to Ministers&#148;. This process has been developed over more than 35 years and has for a number of workforces, including groups without the right to take industrial action, stood the test of time and has been seen to deliver a fair and effective mechanism for determining pay awards.</p>

I see in your Lordships' House at least two former distinguished Secretaries of State for Health. The doctors and dentists pay review body pay awards were staged four times&#151;in 1984, 1990, 1991 and 1996. The pay award was deferred twice&#151;in 1985 and 1986. In 1993, a pay limit was imposed.

That is the difference. It is as simple and as clear as that. I am delighted when the present Government use the Conservative Government to pray in aid for their errors. On occasions, my Government made just as many errors as the present one. There is no need to pray in aid their errors.</p>

I would caution that party against it. Of course, the noble Earl is right that some of the pay groups I have mentioned are not subject to restrictions on taking industrial action. That is one distinction. But, none the less, I seek to demonstrate that the party opposite has not been reluctant to stage pay awards in the light of recommendations made by independent review bodies. The fact is that the noble Earl might have given me just one or two more seconds to list the times that pay awards were staged in relation to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body&#151;in 1984, 1990, 1994 and 1996. The previous Government deferred an Armed Forces Pay Review Body recommendation once and in 1993 a pay limit was imposed. I could go on.</p>

<a name="80430-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080430110000073"></a>Obviously we have considered the amendment and the impact that it would have. Our conclusion is that the Government have an established responsibility for managing public finances. We do not think that it is appropriate to subject to parliamentary approval the Government&#146;s discretion to regulate an important factor in those finances. Parliament already has the overriding oversight of departmental expenditure, which we think gets the balance right. But, at the end of the day, the Government must reserve the discretion to make the final decision, which is why we cannot support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

These two bodies cannot strike. There is a review body, which always has access to information before it makes its recommendations. If the Government seek to change that, as the Minister says, they have discretion. In the light of what they have done, we say that that discretion is too great. Therefore, it should be controlled and made responsible to Parliament. I do not accept the Minister&#146;s reply and I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="080430110000105"></a><a name="80430-0010.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80430-0010.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="080430110000759"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill has two purposes. First, it allows us to deliver the NICs aspects of the personal tax package announced during Budget 2007. By allowing the upper earnings limit to be aligned with the point at which higher rate tax starts to be paid, the Bill will allow regulations to simplify the UK&#146;s tax and NICs system significantly. From April 2009, there will be just two main rates of income tax, and they will apply to the same bands of earnings as the two rates of NICs, creating one of the simplest personal tax structures of any developed country.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080430110000106"></a>Secondly, these proposals maintain the settlement achieved in the Pensions Act 2007 which are central to the Government&#146;s commitment to provide a solid and simpler state pension. By bringing forward the introduction of the upper accrual point, the Bill maintains the timetable for the removal of earnings-related state second pension to that recommended by the Pensions Commission. That will mean that by around 2030, the very complex earnings-related structure of the state second pension will be withdrawn, leaving behind a wholly flat rate scheme that will be simple to administer and simple for contributors and pensioners to understand.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080430110000107"></a>I would like to explain each of those purposes in more detail, starting with the changes to the upper earnings limit. This is part of a package of reforms to the personal tax system announced at Budget 2007. That package is not for parliamentary debate today, as the majority of the changes are being legislated for in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. Noble Lords will be aware of the broad thrust of the package and of the proposal for further measures following debate around the withdrawal of the 10 per cent income tax band. However, I remind the House that the reforms will take 600,000 more pensioners out of income tax, and 200,000 more children out of poverty.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080430110000108"></a>A central part of the package is to align the national insurance upper earnings limit&#151;the point at which Class I NICs become payable at 1 per cent rather than 11 per cent&#151;with the level at which higher rate income tax becomes payable. The same will happen to the upper profits limit, which is the equivalent point for the self-employed&#151;the point at which NICs become payable at 1 per cent rather than 8 per cent.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080430110000109"></a>As announced, moving both limits will be a two-stage process. In this tax year, the upper earnings limit&#151;the UEL&#151;will be increased to &#163;770 per week. In 2009-10, it will increase again to be aligned with the level at which higher rate income tax becomes payable. It is the second stage of that increase which requires the change to primary legislation under the Bill. At present, the maximum level of the UEL is restricted to seven and a half times the primary threshold, the point at which NICs start to be paid. To align the two systems from 2009-10, that link needs to be removed, which is what the Bill makes possible.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80430-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080430110000110"></a>I am sure that the House will want to know that there will be effective parliamentary scrutiny of the level of the UEL once the restriction of it being no more than seven and a half times the primary threshold is removed. The setting of the UEL is currently subject to the negative resolution procedure. However, I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the annual regulations for setting the level of the upper earnings limit will now be subject to affirmative resolution procedures, so that for the first time noble Lords and Members of the other place will have the chance to debate any changes. This approach is consistent with the way in which changes to upper profits limit and lower profits limit for class 4 National Insurance contributions paid by the self-employed are made. They, too, are able to be set without restriction, but are subject to the affirmative procedures. It will also be consistent with the setting of the lower earning limit once it is no longer linked to the level of basic state pension when that becomes earnings linked. The Delegated Powers Committee, which examined the Bill and the powers it contains, did not make any comment. Therefore, I feel sure that these clauses guarantee a fair compromise between allowing detailed legislative scrutiny without imposing excessive burdens.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080430110000111"></a>The Bill&#146;s second purpose is to maintain the policy position on S2P that was settled in the Pensions Act 2007. S2P grew out of SERPS but with significantly improved coverage for lower-paid workers and people with parenting or caring responsibilities, typically women. Currently around 2.1 million carers, over 90 per cent of them women, and about 6.1 million low earners, almost 60 per cent of them women, are accruing entitlement to S2P. As a result of reform, around 1 million more people will accrue S2P from 2010, and approximately 90 per cent of them will be women.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080430110000112"></a>The Pensions Act 2007 reformed S2P. It greatly simplified the first element of the pension which was designed with particular emphasis on the low paid and carers. It also made provision gradually to withdraw the second element of S2P, the earnings-related component. It may be helpful to recap briefly the background to that policy development, and to do so I need to take you back to November 2005 and the second report of the Pensions Commission. The commission analysed the advantages and disadvantages of a single-tier state system, folding basic state pension and S2P pension in together, but found that the transition between now and a simple single-tier pension was too complex and that buying out that complexity was unaffordable.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080430110000113"></a>Instead the commission reasoned for an earnings-uprated basic state pension supported by a second-tier state pension and looked at three options for that second tier. The first option was that new accruals to S2P would cease immediately with an earnings-related national auto-enrolment scheme taking its place. The second option was to carry on as now under the current structure of S2P where the earnings-related element will be gradually eliminated by the mid-2050s. The commission&#146;s third option was to accelerate elimination but still maintain some earnings-related compulsion for a transition period.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_300"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80430-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080430110000114"></a>The commission recommended the third option as the best way forward, and in our Green Paper of May 2006 we accepted the commission&#146;s recommendation on the withdrawal of earnings-relation. Our reasoning, drawn from the commission&#146;s, was that a simpler flat rate S2P, combined with an earnings-uprated basic state pension, will provide the solid foundation that will give people the confidence to save in personal accounts. It also avoided a sudden reduction in the contracted-out rebate and with it a reduction of support for defined benefit schemes that an immediate end to earnings-relations might cause.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080430110000115"></a>The Pensions Act 2007 introduced a device for withdrawal: we would freeze the upper point for accruals in S2P. This new upper accrual point would be set at a time and a rate which would mean that earnings-related accruals within S2P would cease around 2030, keeping to the commission&#146;s proposed timetable. The upper accrual point replaces the upper earnings limit in both S2P and rebate calculations and was planned for introduction from 6 April 2012 at the earliest. However, the upper accrual point now needs to be introduced earlier in order to ensure that our S2P reforms can be delivered as intended with a fully flat-rated S2P from around 2030.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080430110000116"></a>The Bill therefore implements the Chancellor&#146;s announcement in the Pre-Budget Report in October 2007 that the introduction of the upper accrual point would be brought forward to 6 April 2009. The need for this change results from the above-inflation increases in the upper earnings limit which we have just been discussing. If introduction of the upper accrual point is not brought forward, there would be knock-on effects to the pensions reforms introduced in last year&#146;s Pensions Act. These knock-on effects would include delays to the timetable for delivering a flat-rate state second pension because, if left to 2012, the upper accrual point would have been introduced at a higher point than was originally expected. The above-inflation increase in the upper earnings limit would also have meant higher earners potentially making small but nevertheless unintended gains in their pensions over and above the pension White Paper reforms because S2P accrues on the portion of earnings between the lower and upper earnings limit, a band which will become wider.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080430110000117"></a>A further effect would have been a larger than expected increase in the band of earnings on which contracted-out rebates are paid. This is because the rebate reflects the S2P forgone and is, again, paid on earnings between the lower and upper earnings limit. The group that would have benefited from this increase in the rebates would have been higher earners accruing higher pension entitlements than intended under the pension reforms. By introducing the upper accrual point in 2009 rather than 2012, the Bill prevents most of these anomalous gains as well as returning the timetable for the removal of earnings-related state second pension to that recommended by the Pensions Commission. While the proposal to introduce the upper accrual point in 2009 will affect some high earners, S2P accrual and rebates for this group are still expected to be higher than those envisaged in the pension White Paper reforms. They will still see significant gains from our overall package

In future, someone earning at the level of the UEL today will be gaining around &#163;45 a week in state pension. Those are the outcomes we promised under the White Paper and those are the outcomes we will still deliver.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080430110000118"></a>This new point, the upper accrual point, will be introduced at the level of the upper earnings limit for 2008-09, which is &#163;770 per week. From April 2009, the upper accrual point will replace the upper earnings limit as the threshold for the calculation of both S2P and contracted-out rebates. It is proposed that it will be frozen in cash terms at its introductory level, while the lower earnings limit and lower earning threshold will continue to increase annually, as now, in line with prices and earnings respectively. The combination of all three thresholds will mean that the band of earnings on which the current earnings-related state second pension and contracted-out rebates are based will reduce year on year. As a result, future accruals of S2P will be wholly flat-rated with no earnings-related element.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080430110000119"></a>This change will mean that from 6 April 2009 all employers will need to calculate, record and report additional information for employees with earnings above the upper accrual point. Although this will require changes to their payroll records, the information is essential for both S2P purposes and the calculation of contracted-out rebates and was something that was already on the horizon with the intended introduction of the upper accrual point in 2012.</p>

<a name="80430-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080430110000120"></a>In conclusion, this is both an important and a necessary Bill. It helps us to implement a personal tax package that increases simplicity while reducing child poverty and removing many pensioners out of income tax. It also allows us to return to the timetable for the introduction of a simple flat-rated state second pension scheme. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

It is narrowly drawn, but it has wide-ranging implications, or so I shall seek to suggest. I shall not go into the flattening of S2P&#151;I understand the logic of that and think it is sensible. Instead I shall raise two issues. The first is some issues concerning the alignment of NICs and tax bands. The second, which will not surprise my noble friend, is the issue of buy-back.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080430115000004"></a>NICs and tax thresholds have always been curiously connected. It was not until 1975 that we constructed LELs and UELs, as we currently understand them, as a self-enclosed system with a crude ratio in which LELs were about a quarter of average earnings and UELs at about one and a half of average earnings. In 1985, the then Government removed UEL for employers but not&#151;although it is often suggested by those to the left of me, and perhaps even by those to the right of me&#151;for employees as well. A few years back, the Government also separated the LEL from the tax threshold. I cannot find out when, but it may have been when we introduced tax credits to replace family credit. I am not sure about that. We now have a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_302"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary tax threshold that is &#163;10 or so higher than LEL, which itself is now quite arbitrarily attached to the level of the basic state pension, which is a benefit. Finally, in a move which separates the national insurance upper limits from benefits, we are reconnecting UEL to the upper tax threshold. So we now have alignment of the tax and benefit system at the top but some rather curious connections at the bottom, where LEL runs. It is those connections that I want to explore now, particularly as they very much interact with those who are also experiencing the loss of the 10p tax band.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080430115000005"></a>It is even more complicated than that. At the bottom, we have a tax credit threshold at 16 hours&#146; work, which gives you tax credits. It is different from the LEL because you can run several small jobs together to qualify, but if you do get tax credits, that passports you through to national insurance, notwithstanding your being below the LEL on all other grounds. LEL is still for some arbitrary reason attached to the basic state pension and gives entitlement to contributory benefits. The question I want to ask my noble friend&#151;as I gave the department notice of it yesterday, I am confident he will have an answer to it&#151;is whether this LEL will rise with earnings from 2012 as will pensions, rather than with RPI as at present. At the bottom is the primary threshold, PT, at which point you pay tax.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080430115000006"></a>If the LEL rises with earnings, because it is attached to the basic state pension which will rise with earnings, the gap between it and the primary tax threshold, which I presume will be largely RPI&#146;d, will narrow over time: LEL will rise faster than the primary threshold. Equally, if average earnings rise faster than the minimum wage, an increasing number of people will fall below the LEL, though working 16 hours a week at minimum wage, and lose entitlement to contributory benefits.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080430115000007"></a>In discussion on the Bill in the Commons, everybody fretted about what was happening at the top; nobody looked at what was happening at the bottom. I am sure that my noble friend can allay my fears. However, if LEL rises with basic state pensions and its earnings links, what are the implications for those, especially women whose earnings are rising less fast, who are on the minimum wage or who work part time? Will they become progressively disfranchised from contributory benefits? If the primary threshold remains RPI&#146;d, does it mean that LEL and primary threshold will, as with the UEL, again become realigned over time, reconnecting the lower earnings limit with the tax threshold, both at bottom and at top?</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080430115000008"></a>It is clear that the higher that the LEL rises, the more people, such as partnered women in part-time jobs and disabled people in part-time work, are potentially excluded from contributory benefits. The simple answer would be to break the link with the basic state pension level and allow LEL to remain below that at which the BSP rises, because people would otherwise drop out of the contributory system. My noble friend may be able to give me other reassurances about the distributional effects. Real issues surrounding who will be eligible for a contributory system will arise if we do not think ahead about what is going to happen to LEL if it continues to be connected to a BSP that will be earnings-linked rather than RPI-linked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080430115000009"></a>My second point is that those who are currently disconnected from contributory benefits, especially for BSP, have an incomplete national insurance record. I rather doubt that my noble friend can give me the reassuring reply that I would like also on this. </p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080430115000010"></a>Those who are savvy or well-heeled, or who have parents or husbands with the same fortunate attributes, can buy back their missing national insurance contributions as they go along, back to a further six years. But poorer women may well have missing years long before their previous six years. They may have had children before 1978; they may have dovetailed together several part-time jobs&#151;if they are not eligible for tax credit, they do not get into the NI system; they may be service wives accompanying husbands abroad; or they may have extended caring responsibilities for older people. As a result, they would have a shortfall on their record which they could not cover under existing rules, meaning that only a quarter of women, compared with 90 per cent of men, currently retire with a full BSP. The Government&#146;s figures are higher only because widows inherit a full BSP from a contributory husband. Therefore, the relevant statistics are about not when they retire but what they currently enjoy on average during their retirement.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080430115000011"></a>The situation of those pensioners will improve from 2010, and dramatically so from 2020, thanks to the Government&#146;s Pensions Bills, but in the mean time there will be a sandwich generation which as it retires is dependent on the support of partners or the state to fund their retirement even though they would like to help themselves by co-purchasing missing years back beyond the six-year rule. We are talking about women who, as we have argued previously in this House, keep several generations afloat: their own older children, their grandchildren, their partner or husband and often elderly parents as well. By supporting others they will often have lost the chance to support themselves, at least with a pension of their own.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080430115000012"></a>We debated this matter very fully last summer. I am considering tabling similar amendments to this Bill to allow buy-back beyond six years by amending the 1992 social security Act. I hope that if I do so the House will be minded to support me as fully and extensively as it did last summer when the Government faced their biggest defeat since 1997. I am sure the House would forgive me if the amendment introduced delays to the passing of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080430115000013"></a>If I propose such a measure, I hope that my noble friend will not tell me on behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury that it cannot be afforded. The cost of such an amendment, with sensible hurdles in place, would run on average at about &#163;25 million a year, declining sharply after 2030. The current Exchequer contribution to class 3 buy-back contributions is of the order of &#163;450 million for the last year for which I have figures. Each and every year it fluctuates by more than the cost of this would-be amendment. That fluctuation in contribution, and its scale, seems to bother nobody one bit. We cannot suddenly start to worry about the cost only when it comes to helping poorer women help themselves.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080430115000014"></a>As those missing years are bought by all and sundry, including by Ministers and ex-Ministers, I hope we will not be told that it is poorly targeted. We do not  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_304"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>know. I have asked and been told that the Government do not collect information about who currently receives this benefit by way of class 3 contributions. I suspect that it is poorly targeted. If we do not ask the questions, we cannot be seriously worried about the issue. Therefore, suddenly to put it on the back of some poorer women is inappropriate.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080430115000015"></a>The third argument that has been run is that of risk: if poorer women knew that at the end of their working lives they could buy back missing years they would not do it during the course of their working lives. This is to presume a rationality which is sadly missing from the lives of women who possibly in many cases do not even understand the reduced married women&#146;s stamp. In any case, we are dealing with a transitional generation, those who from about 2105 to 2020 will certainly enjoy the benefits of the Pensions Act and the reduced number of contributions they will need to make&#151;only 30 years. Therefore, those women who are now 50 to 60 cannot revisit their past behaviour and change it in perverse ways that my noble friend or HM Treasury might think unacceptable. That behaviour is already there; we need to be able to help them to help themselves.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080430115000016"></a>Finally, relevant to affordability&#151;I have a couple of remarks on this&#151;is the state of the National Insurance Fund, which can only be used for contributory benefits, apart from the NHS supplementation. Obviously that fund does not sit there as a piggy bank; it allows for reduction of the borrowing requirement which in turn is a form of not-so-hidden subsidy to other services. The guidelines from GAD are for a 16.7 per cent balance, which I calculate as about &#163;12 billion on current levels of contributory benefit expenditure. The balances are growing fast; the figure now&#151;for the current year, I think&#151;is forecast at &#163;42 billion, as opposed to &#163;12 billion. That is equivalent to 65 per cent of benefit expenditure, rather than 16.7 per cent. The balances are also growing each and every year&#151;by &#163;5 billion, then &#163;6 billion and &#163;7 billion&#151;because more people are earning and paying higher contributions, while fewer people are drawing out.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080430115000017"></a>I repeat; there is a &#163;5 billion addition, rising to &#163;6 billion and &#163;7 billion, yet we cannot have &#163;20 million from a fund devoted to contributory benefits. Of course, given the demographics and the earnings link to BSP, these surpluses will begin to flatten from 2012 on, but while employment remains high&#151;and with the raising of the state pension age, which also puts into the Exchequer a contribution equivalent to about &#163;5 billion a year, but is excluded from nearly all discussion&#151;that flattening will take some time to occur. I suspect we will be well into the 2020s, depending on unemployment figures, before we even begin to come back near GAD&#146;s recommended figures. By that time, the cost of these buy-back proposals will have dwindled to the stuff of margins of error.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080430115000018"></a>I am confident that if the National Insurance Fund were in deficit and required a taxpayers&#146; contribution, we would be told quite sharply that there was no money available for increases in certain benefits. If my noble friend will forgive me, I will tease him that such arguments, interestingly, only ever seem to run in one direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080430115000019"></a>I am entirely content with the clauses in this Bill as it stands, but it is about reading the silences&#151;the things not said.

In the minds of voters, this Bill relates to tax; that is how national insurance is perceived. From a parliamentary perspective, it relates to contributions to that extraordinary and almost mythical creature, the National Insurance Fund&#151;about which almost everyone is completely ignorant. However, it does, and therefore we have the joys of debating it at length in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080430110000123"></a>As the Minister explained, the Bill contains but two principal proposals. When the Bill was debated in another place, Ministers explained that the first, the increase in the upper earnings limit for national insurance, was part of a carefully balanced package. He repeated that principle this evening; however, unfortunately for the balance, another component of the package was the abolition of the 10p tax rate. That, of course, is now being reversed. It would be cruel to ask the Minister to explain current government thinking on how it is to be reversed, and therefore I will not, but any discussion of these measures in the context of a balance is now completely redundant.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080430110000124"></a>The other argument used, and used again this evening, was that this is a simplification measure. It is, and we welcome it as such. We are in favour of tax simplifications, but both we and the Government like a tax simplification that also, as it happens, brings in an additional &#163;1.5 billion in revenue. We should have more of those. Our complaint here is simply that the Government should be clearer that one consequence of this measure is to raise that amount of money. I do not think I heard the Minister explain in any detail in his introductory speech that main consequence of this measure&#151;and it is, arguably, one main reason behind it. Given the way in which the Government are perceived, if they are raising &#163;1.5 billion&#151;a quite significant sum&#151;they ought to come clean about that and not pretend by hiding behind the fact that this is a simplification measure.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080430110000125"></a>There have also been rather exaggerated claims in another place by the Government about the benefit that this additional revenue will bring, not least on child poverty. In their wilder moments, Ministers in another place almost seemed to suggest that child poverty and many other social ills were to be solved, virtually at a stroke, by this relatively modest amount. Getting to the bottom of how the money will actually be spent would, I suspect, be a fruitless exercise. However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has come up with a relatively modest and sensible suggestion; namely, to ask the Government to publish their projections of how much of the extra revenue raised will be allocated to the National Insurance  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_306"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Fund and the NHS. Could the Minister express a view on whether the Government would be minded to accede to such a request?</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080430110000126"></a>The second proposal in the Bill is to introduce the upper accrual point in relation to state second pensions. Unlike the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, I am a mere toiler in the vineyard of Treasury matters and have never graduated to a detailed understanding of pension legislation. I suspect that even though we have a Committee yet to come on this Bill, I will not qualify even at the end of our deliberations.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080430110000127"></a>In general terms, however, as the Minister knows, these Benches have been extremely critical of the Government&#146;s priorities on pensioners&#151;in particular, on pensioner poverty. We have been critical of pension credits, not least because 40 per cent of eligible pensioners do not claim them, and have argued the case both for a speedier reintroduction of the link between state pensions and earnings, and a move toward a citizen&#146;s pension&#151;particularly as a means of moving to deal with the scandal of women who receive little or nothing by way of a state pension.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080430110000128"></a>I do not intend to repeat to your Lordships this evening all of the arguments in favour of those policies. However, what happens to the extra revenue that is raised under this proposal? I believe that it is likely to be up to &#163;450 million a year. In debates in another place, Ministers said that that sum was accounted for in the 2007 Red Book. I have looked at that, and while the figure may be included in one of the broader totals, I was not able to see it identified anywhere separately. I accept that that may be a result of my slipshod reading of the Red Book, but I would welcome some clarification from the Minister on how that additional revenue is accounted for in that statement; to a casual or even semi-qualified observer, it is very unclear at present.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080430110000129"></a>Much of the debate on this Bill in another place related not to these principal changes, however, but to one consequence of them and one issue of parliamentary principle. The consequential change is the abolition of the ratio, of 7.5 times, between the upper and lower earning limits. That ratio is long-standing, and the noble Baroness explained how it was established in the first place. It has been seen as a check on any Government&#146;s ability to raise that limit without primary legislation and proper parliamentary scrutiny. The parliamentary principle, linked to that point, is that national insurance thresholds and limits can, of course, be changed by order despite the fact that the change in limit can have substantial consequences on revenue. The Minister explained that in future any changes to the upper limit will have to be by affirmative resolution in a statutory instrument. As we have debated many times in your Lordships&#146; House, this is very different from the level of parliamentary scrutiny that applies on measures that come in via primary legislation. I have considerable sympathy with the concerns expressed in another place on this issue.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080430110000130"></a>There is probably a consensus among the parties that once the change to align the two limits&#151;the upper NI limit and the threshold for higher rate national tax&#151;has been brought about, they should remain aligned, and that the Government should not succumb  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the temptation to raise the upper national insurance threshold above the starting point for upper rate income tax. There was considerable debate in another place about how that might be achieved, the problem being&#151;as Members in another place sought to address when they tabled amendments&#151;the completely different process and procedures for dealing with income tax and national insurance changes and the different timetable for introducing a national insurance change that starts at the beginning of the tax year and a tax change that starts at the beginning of the tax year.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080430110000131"></a>No doubt we will explore some of these issues in Committee, but it seems to me that one could go some way towards dealing with this problem if the Government effected two things. First, they could confirm that for the remainder of this Parliament, at least, the upper national insurance limit would not exceed the threshold for the 40 per cent of income tax and that from now on changes to both those limits could be set out in the Pre-Budget Report. If they moved in step&#151;which seems to be what the Government want and what there is a consensus on&#151;people would be reassured; but if there was any attempt to hide the limit for national insurance purposes beyond the threshold for higher rate income tax, we would at least be forewarned before statutory instruments were introduced and there would be that much more scope for parliamentary debate.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080430110000132"></a>We could, of course, begin to treat national insurance in legislative terms as if it were a tax, but that is probably too revolutionary a step and certainly way beyond the scope of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080430115000021"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has used this opportunity to return to the fray on buy-back. The whole House was shocked when the Minister reneged on the commitment that he had given her during proceedings on the Pensions Bill. The noble Baroness, in her doughty way, has refined her attack and sought to deal with the objections that the Government have come up with. In particular, through the use of hurdles, she wishes to constrain the annual cost of implementing any buy-back proposals. I just say to the Minister today that the noble Baroness makes a strong case and, if she decides to pursue it in this Bill, without making any commitments, we will look very carefully at whether we can support her on the refined basis that she has put forward.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080430115000022"></a>For all the Minister&#146;s fine words, this is a money-grabbing Bill designed to pour a couple of billion pounds each year into the Treasury. It has a fig leaf of pensions and national insurance reform but money is what it is about. It is ironic that your Lordships&#146; House is able to consider this Bill in detail because, technically, it is not a money Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred to this. I welcome the opportunity to consider this Bill fully and would welcome the ability of your Lordships&#146; House to consider the technical aspects of Finance Bills in future. But that is for another day.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080430115000023"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out, it is little more than a fiction that national insurance is not a tax. The money goes into a mythical National Insurance Fund. But, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, pointed out, there is a surplus building up in that fund. On the basis of the last accounts that I could trace, the Government Actuary recommended a balance of around &#163;10 billion at March 2006, but at that date the fund had &#163;34 billion in it&#151;and so &#163;24 billion had already been used to prop up the Government&#146;s spending. Will the Minister say when the 2006-07 accounts will be available, as they seem to be overdue? What does he expect the figure to be on an up-to-date basis&#151;say, at March 2008&#151;and what impact will this Bill have on the surplus? The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, referred to the increasing surplus that we expect to see from higher rates of higher national insurance payments being made. It is clear that the money which will be raised by this Bill is in substance an increased tax, because it is not needed for National Insurance Fund purposes. Rather, it will fund the UK&#146;s budget deficit, which I remind the House is now outdone in relative size only by those of Pakistan, Hungary and Egypt.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080430115000024"></a>The first thing that this Bill does is to increase the upper earnings limit so that employees pay national insurance at the full rate on more of their earnings. This was introduced by the Prime Minister when he was Chancellor as part of the package of income tax changes which have been so mishandled by the Government. Only those on middle incomes are affected by the raising of the upper earnings limit under this Bill, paying &#163; 1.5 billion a year as their contribution to the package. But we know, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out, that another part of the package was the 10p rate abolition, which hit 5.3 million mainly single people on low earnings. We still have no details on how, when and to what extent that wrong will be righted. I am sure that voters, when they go to the polls tomorrow, will remember that the Prime Minister knows how to raise money but has no idea about how to do it with fairness and equity.</p>

<a name="80430-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080430115000025"></a>We agree that, in principle, the national insurance and income tax systems should be harmonised, but this Bill does not do that. There are still significant differences between the two, including the weekly basis of contributions and different bases on which national insurance and income tax are levied. Noble Lords should be aware that this Bill is not about reform; it is about grabbing &#163;1.5 billion a year dressed up as reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080430115000026"></a>The Government pretend that this Bill harmonises the upper earnings limit and the start point for the higher rate tax, but that is completely untrue. What the Bill does is to give the Government power to raise the upper earnings limit by order to whatever level the Government choose. There is no restriction on the amount at which the upper earnings limit can be set. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred to the loss of the constraint of the 6.5 to 7.5 times the primary threshold, contained in current legislation. The only constraint is the rather ludicrous one of there being an affirmative order. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that that allows for insufficient scrutiny and we shall return to this area in Committee because we believe that some restrictions on the Government&#146;s  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>use of this power should be enshrined in legislation. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that I have given some thought to a series of amendments that might achieve the alignment over the next two years but also put a constraint on the Government thereafter.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080430115000027"></a>The second thing that the Bill does is to raise money for the Treasury by stopping the accrual of S2P above an upper accruals point from 2009-10. As I have already made plain to the House before, I have never understood how S2P actually works, but I am hoping next year when I reach pensionable age that I might find out whether I have accrued any. This change raises approximately &#163;450 million a year, mainly through contracted-out rebates. We heard the Minister&#146;s spin on this; it is all about implementing the Pensions Commission recommendations that the S2P should be flat-rated by 2030. The Government&#146;s May 2006 White Paper, <I>Security in Retirement: </I><I>T</I><I>owards a </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>P</I><I>ension </I><I>S</I><I>ystem</I>, was very clear on the Government&#146;s policy. It said at paragraph 3.13 that,</p>
<ul><a name="080430115000073"></a>&#147;we will ... reform the State Second Pension so that it becomes a simple, flat-rate weekly top-up to the basic State Pension. Accruals will start gradually to become flat rate at the same time as we start to uprate the basic State Pension by earnings. We estimate that the State Second Pension will become completely flat rate around 2030 or shortly afterwards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080430115000028"></a>The policy was to link flat-rating to earnings linking and the 2030 date for the completion of the flat-rating was a mere estimate.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080430115000029"></a>All we know about earnings linking is that it will not start before 2012 but could start any time thereafter within the next Parliament, subject to the Treasury&#146;s view of &#147;affordability&#148;. We also know that the Government&#146;s finances are not in great shape and so there are considerable doubts about whether the commencement of earnings linking can be afforded in 2012 or even in 2015. We shall be exploring this further with the Minister. For today the key issue is that flat-rating the S2P is being started three years ahead of its earliest planned date and possibly six years ahead of the actual introduction of earnings linking. The Minister has rehearsed the Government&#146;s line that they had to act because the increase in the upper earnings limit in Budget 2007 meant that, if nothing else were done, flat-rating would be delayed from the date of 2030. But the 2030 date was merely an estimate rather than a target and hence there is a degree of hypocrisy in now elevating it to target status.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080430115000030"></a>In another place my honourable friend Mr David Gauke probed Treasury Ministers on this decision to bring forward the start of flat-rating. The answers that he received are somewhat incredible. Apparently the Treasury knew when Budget 2007 was put together that the UEL changes would increase the S2P accruals and would hence affect contracted-out rebates in the near term, and that this additional cost was included in the 2007 Red Book. I think the noble Lord, Lord Newby, was looking for revenue in the 2007 Red Book. Actually it was an additional cost that we are told is in the Red Book but I have not found it either. The Treasury also knew, apparently, that it would affect the flat-rating projections but it seems that the Chancellor, the other Treasury Ministers and Treasury

Instead they waited until this Bill was considered in another place before coming clean on the issue. At best, this is Government at their least transparent.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080430115000031"></a>Having increased the UEL, there were several options for achieving flat-rating. Given the Government&#146;s existing policy statements, a disinterested observer might conclude that the most rational way was to realign from 2012 or from whenever earnings linking was introduced if that were later. Whether to flat-rate by 2030 would have been a separate decision affecting the speed of achieving flat-rating. Any observer who knows this Government would know that the Treasury would just see another stealth tax on offer and select the option which produced the greatest inflow to the Treasury. We have stopped counting the number of stealth taxes the Prime Minister introduced when he was Chancellor because the number grew so large, but this one has to qualify for a special prize for stealthiness.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080430115000032"></a>We should also remember that the Government have form on using national insurance rebates. The last quinquennial determination blatantly loaded costs onto employers in order to save the Treasury money. The Government ignored the advice of their own Government Actuary as well as submissions made by employers and the pensions industry. The Government lamely tried to hide behind the words &#147;cost neutrality&#148; and &#147;fiscal circumstances&#148;&#151;that is, the Treasury&#146;s view of what it wanted to afford rather than what occupational pension schemes needed in order to compensate them for assuming contracted-out obligations.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080430115000033"></a>In this Bill the Government are at it again, giving plausibility to their raid by describing the rebates in the impact assessment as &#147;anomalous gains&#148; for employers. When are the Government going to treat private sector occupational pension schemes, especially defined benefit ones which are most affected by the rebates, with respect? Do they really think that employers, already cheated out of their contracted-out rebate levels, think that these so-called gains are anomalous? The Government are doing everything possible to kill occupational pension provision and we will be discussing that again with the Minister when we reach the Pensions Bill. This is a miserable little Bill. I feel sorry for the Minister, who is an honest man, for having to come to the House to defend it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080430115000035"></a>Before I respond to each of the points raised, let me remind the House of the two purposes of the Bill. First, it allows the Government to deliver the package of personal tax reforms announced at Budget 2007, in particular by allowing the upper earnings limit to be aligned with the point at which higher rate tax starts to be paid. This Bill makes possible a major simplification of the UK&#146;s tax and NIC system. I believe that has a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measure of support from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, although I acknowledge that there is not an identity between the tax and NIC systems. We are not suggesting that there is. Secondly, the Bill is looking at providing a solid and simpler state pension. I will come back to the issues as to why we have advanced the introduction of the upper accrual point in a moment.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080430115000036"></a>I will move on to the individual points raised and start with my noble friend Baroness Hollis. She asked specifically about the lower earnings limit and its link to the basic state pension and expressed a concern that when pensions are increased by earnings, this could drag up the lower earnings limit and therefore exclude people from benefit. It is typical that my noble friend focuses on the lower paid when others have looked at the other end of the scale. This problem was identified and the Pensions Act 2007 makes amendments to break the link between the LEL and the basic state pension from when the basic state pension becomes earnings linked. Breaking that link will avoid the issue that my noble friend has focused on.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080430115000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and my noble friend referred to the issue of class 3 buy-back contributions. I reject the assertion that the Government have reneged on their commitment. What was set out at the time in the other place by my honourable friend Mike O&#146;Brien and repeated by me here was that we would look to try and make the proposition work but having regard to fairness, affordability and simplicity. A lot of work has been done since our debates with HMT and HMRC and stakeholders have had some informal meetings to try and make the proposition work. Our priority and the priority of my noble friend, as expressed tonight, was to find an option which would particularly target women on low incomes living in this country. The challenge has been to come up with a proposition that fits that description. Poorer pensioners are likely to be better off if they are close to retirement under pension credit and it would therefore not benefit them to pay voluntary contributions. They may find themselves paying voluntary contributions and getting no benefit because there would be a withdrawal of pension credit pound for pound. The cost of six years of class 3 contributions is currently around &#163;2,500 and around three quarters of households in the bottom three income deciles containing women aged 55 to 59 have less than &#163;5,000 in savings.</p>

It is generally the case that people at or close to retirement do not wish to take on extra borrowing. Even if there is an arithmetic case for what my noble friend says&#151;I accept that point&#151;I doubt whether, as a practical matter, poorer households would want to take on that additional borrowing.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080430115000040"></a>One concern is that those who could take advantage of the proposal are wealthy expatriates&#151;men and women. We estimate on the original proposition that  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>something like 65,000 people living overseas could benefit. I acknowledge, as indeed has the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that my noble friend&#146;s subsequent amendment to the proposition, particularly to have a 20-year contribution threshold, certainly helps to reduce the cost and raise the barrier to exclude some of the non-residents, but there are potentially significant costs attached.</p>

<a name="80430-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080430115000041"></a>My message is that we need to continue talking about this issue. I want to emphasise my noble friend&#146;s point about the changes made in the Pensions Act 2007. They will narrow the gender pensions gap and deliver fair outcomes to women and carers, and significantly improve women's state pension coverage. I will not go through the detail because we have discussed it before and the clock is moving on. The concern is about targeting. If we had a way of reaching those poorer women whom my honourable friend is most concerned about, as are we, there may be scope for moving forward on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080430115000042"></a>My noble friend also asked about the National Insurance Fund and what would happen to the surplus. My noble friend is well aware that that surplus is invested back into the public sector. If it were not available, the Government, through borrowing or raising taxes, would have to find the wherewithal by other means to fund their current Budget.</p>

For example, income tax is focused on all incomes and national insurance just on earnings. On income tax there is no age limit but for NICs there is a 16 to 60 or 65 age limit. Income tax works on a cumulative basis but NICs is based on an earnings period. The two are not the same.</p>

I understand that they are on different bases. I was seeking to make the point that there is an accumulating surplus in the National Insurance Fund not needed for current purposes and not needed according to the Government Actuary&#146;s Department calculations. It is going into the National Insurance Fund and is being siphoned off immediately into funding expenditure for which it was not designed in the same way that tax is used to fund expenditure. That was the point that I was making, not the technical underlying bases of how they are raised.</p>

Reducing the basic rate to 20p cost &#163;9.6 billion. The alignment of NICs created a surplus of &#163;1.5 billion. Raising the aligned UEL and HRT by &#163;800 a year&#151;the inflationary increase&#151;cost &#163;0.25 billion. An increase in age-related tax allowances by &#163;1,180 above inflation cost just short of &#163;1 billion. There was a price tag of &#163;1 billion for an increase in the child element of child tax credit by &#163;150 above earnings and there were other components. Overall, that package cost &#163;2.5 billion&#151;before whatever might arise from the current look at two groups of people who have been debated extensively recently. It is simply not right to peel away one component and say that this is about raising revenue. It is not.</p>

I am saying that the starting point in all this is to simplify the tax and national insurance system. The noble Baroness's party called for that and I thought in principle supported it. She referred to that earlier. Other commentators have supported it. The IFS has supported that alignment as a simplification of the system. If you are going to simplify the system, that is done by having various components at its point of introduction. It is absolutely right to do that. But it is entirely spurious to take out one component and say, &#147;This is a tax increase. That is what this is all about&#148;. That is absolutely not so.

However, if the Government raise taxes, by and large, they spend it on something. That does not mean that they have not raised taxes in the first place. That is what is happening here. It may be that the money is being spent on the most wonderful purposes that humankind has ever considered, but that does not negate the fact that in order to spend it you have to raise it. That equates to a tax.</p>

The introduction of UAP does not affect the overall application of NICs between the NIF and the NHS, which are calculated in accordance with Section 162 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It does not affect that at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080430115000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked why we should allow changes to national insurance to take place by affirmative order and whether that gave the Government carte blanche to do things that they should not. We have been clear about aligning the UEL at the higher rate tax starting point just as we have been clear about aligning the primary threshold with the personal allowance&#151;effectively the start of income tax. That latter point is dealt with by regulation. I can see no reason why the level at which employees stop paying NICs at the main national insurance employee rate of 11 per cent should be subject to primary legislative restrictions, when the point at which they start paying NICs has none. There is simply a symmetry about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080430115000059"></a>The noble Baroness said that we should not have gone about the flat rating as we did. To reiterate the point: the need to bring forward the timing of the upper accrual point was driven by the change in the upper earnings limit. If that were not increased, there would have been no necessity. I believe that the noble Baroness is trying to make a point.</p>

If one component changes, it seems entirely reasonable that we should try to end up where we would otherwise have been, where that settlement was going to take us, and that is what this is doing. Notwithstanding that, there is still some extra gain for higher earners beyond that which would have accrued to them under the original proposals, because by bringing forward the upper accruals point a few years early, there is still a longer time period by which that level of earnings would be within the S2P accruals. So it is entirely justified to do what we are doing in the Bill.</p>

I reiterate that this is a narrow technical Bill which is based on wider issues that are current at the moment. We will cover more of the detail in Committee. Trying to simplify the income tax and national insurance system, which is what this facilitates, and trying to make sure that our pension settlement consensus stays on track, where it should be, is the right thing to do.

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000009"></a>The noble Earl said: I wish to move Amendment No. 21 and speak to Amendments Nos. 56, 71 and 88. We come to an issue that to the veterans of health legislation over the past eight or nine years will not be new: equity of access to medicines and other approved treatments. In January this year, the Health Select Committee in another place published its report on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The report made a number of recommendations about the implementation of NICE guidance and the uptake of medicines that NICE has approved. The problem here is a serious one. At present there is no consistency round the country as to the uptake of NICE-approved therapies. Some PCTs go to considerable trouble to build NICE guidance into their plans, whereas others do little more than pay token regard to it, if that. The result is what is often referred to as the postcode lottery for medicines, although the analogy with the lottery is not a particularly good one.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000010"></a>I could give many examples to illustrate the lack of consistency to which I referred. I shall mention just a few, starting with osteoporosis treatments. NICE issued guidance in January 2005 strongly recommending that women aged 75 and over who have suffered a prior fragility fracture should be treated with osteoporosis therapy. However, a recent survey undertaken by the NHS Information Centre found that the worst performing quartile of GP practices could demonstrate that only 18 per cent of eligible patients received care in line with this part of NICE guidance. The best performing quartile could demonstrate that only 32 per cent of eligible patients received the care that NICE guidance recommended. The same NICE guidance also recommends that women aged between 65 and 74 who have suffered a prior fragility fracture be referred for a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>DEXA bone density scan to assess future fracture risk. Here the picture was even worse. Even the best performing quartile of GP practices could demonstrate that only 12.5 per cent of eligible patients received care in line with the NICE guidance.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000011"></a>On prostate cancer, NICE issued the guidance <I>I</I><I>mproving </I><I>O</I><I>utcomes in</I><I>Urological </I><I>C</I><I>ancers</I> in September 2002 and set a December 2007 deadline for its full implementation. However, the latest available data show that seven of England&#146;s 30 cancer networks were not on course to have implemented the guidance by the deadline&#151;a full five years after the guidance was issued.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000012"></a>Herceptin was recommended by NICE for use in women with HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer in March 2002 and for use in women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer in August 2006. Previous audits show that the implementation of NICE guidance has improved over time, but significant variations in usage around the country remain. The latest data, adjusted for incidence, show that the seven best performing cancer networks in England provide around 65 per cent of eligible patients with Herceptin but that the seven worst performing cancer networks provide it to less than 35 per cent of eligible patients. The failure of some cancer networks to implement this NICE guidance is why England, on average, lags a long way behind the European comparator countries in the use of this medicine.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000013"></a>My final example is rheumatoid arthritis. A class of drugs called anti-TNFs was recommended by NICE for the treatment of this condition in March 2002. Even now, many years later, problems still remain in implementation. In 2005, the Audit Commission said that anti-TNF therapies were among the three treatments approved by NICE that PCTs most frequently failed to make available to patients. In late 2006, the British Society for Rheumatology said that half of rheumatologists were reporting funding restrictions relating to anti-TNF therapies. An investigation by the All-Party Group on Inflammatory Arthritis found that less than 60 per cent of PCTs were offering anti-TNFs to patients in accordance with NICE guidance.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000014"></a>What did the Select Committee say about this? Two of its recommendations are especially pertinent in this context. In recommendation 26, it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430117000049"></a>&#147;There need to be additional measures to improve the implementation of clinical guidelines. There should be more help for PCTs to implement guidelines&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430117000043"></a>In recommendation 27, it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430117000050"></a>&#147;Better measurement of guidance implementation is also needed. Self-assessment is not enough. We recommend that the Healthcare Commission should conduct more in-depth inspections of this element of practice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430117000044"></a>It was interesting that NICE itself was enthusiastic in its response to both these recommendations, particularly the first.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000015"></a>The Government&#146;s response was more cryptic. They referred to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual health check, which relies in part on self-declarations by PCTs and trust boards and in part on inspections, the implication being that this process is working entirely without problem. They then go on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430117000051"></a>&#147;Once established, the Care Quality Commission will develop the criteria and methodology it will use to assess and review  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulated health and adult social care. We will ask the commission to reflect on the committee&#146;s recommendations in the course of that work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430117000045"></a>I hope that the Minister will not think it unfair of me if I say that the Government&#146;s policy and intentions do not emerge very clearly from that answer. What role do the Government intend the CQC to play in relation to NICE guidance? Do Ministers agree with the committee that PCTs should play a larger part in making sure that NICE guidance is implemented and that they should receive help in doing so, if necessary from the department itself?</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000016"></a>The question that is begged in all this is: what action counts as implementing NICE guidance? In other words, how little do you have to do as a PCT to claim correctly that you have implemented it? For me, and I suspect for many of us, NICE guidance ought to be defined as the minimum standards for healthcare providers to meet. We surely cannot say that a PCT has correctly ticked the box of implementing NICE guidance when only a small proportion of eligible patients actually receive the recommended treatment.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000017"></a>In response, the Minister may repeat what previous Ministers have said, which is that all this is down to local decision-making. I understand the point, but we have a rule, in the form of a direction of the Government&#146;s own making, that NICE guidance should be regarded as mandatory and subject only to the clinical judgment of doctors in individual cases. If you ask patients what they think they can expect from the NHS in some of these treatment areas, the answer will usually be that they are completely confused. The NICE guidance on atypical medicines for schizophrenia is currently binding because it is guidance, but it is being revised and looks set to be turned into non-binding guidelines. The NICE guidance on medicines to treat ADHD will shortly mutate into guidelines but, unlike the guidelines on atypicals, they will retain a binding requirement on PCTs to provide funding. The NICE guidance on osteoporosis treatment is being reviewed with the intention of incorporating the appraisal in an osteoporosis guideline; here again, unusually, the guideline will remain subject to the ministerial direction on funding.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000018"></a>No wonder there is confusion. Among other things, the amendment would provide an opportunity for patients to get a clearer picture on the implementation of NICE guidance because, with a more transparent evidence base, there is a much better basis for patients and carers to exercise more informed choice on the treatment options available to them. We also have here an opportunity for Parliament to strengthen good governance in healthcare, to raise standards and to enhance equity of access to treatment for patients. It will be possible for the Government and NICE through the Bill to get NICE decisions on medicines universally implemented, leaving the Care Quality Commission to ensure that the guidance is consistently applied locally. I beg to move.</p>

You could not get a more eloquent description of the situation and the incredible importance of the amendments.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000020"></a>I just want to make one point: NICE guidelines are not restricted to medical treatments. I want to refer to the NICE guidance on therapeutic treatments for depression and anxiety. Any service-user survey of people with mental health problems puts right at the top of user priorities the availability of therapeutic psychological treatments. NICE guidance was issued clearly specifying the evidence-based psychological therapies that should be available to people with depression and anxiety. The Government then committed &#163;70 million for a three-year rollout of training across the country to ensure that the evidence-based treatment recommended by NICE would be available to people across the country.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000021"></a>No mental health intervention would do more for the general mental health&#151;the well-being, if you like&#151;of people in this country than the implementation of those NICE guidelines. Yet we are finding that it is nigh on impossible to ensure that PCTs across the country take on board the Government&#146;s policy. If I may say so, even the strategic health authorities are producing guidance to PCTs that is all over the place. It is not consistent; it does not fully take on board the Government&#146;s policy. Therefore, even in the information going out to PCTs there is confusion&#151;there is basically anarchy&#151;and I cannot imagine what will happen at the PCT level. I add my few words to those of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in giving strong support to the amendments. I very much hope that the Government will produce their own amendment to give rise to the outcome that we want.</p>

<p><a name="080430117000022"></a><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080430117000058"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> I give warm support to the amendment. About 35 years ago, when I was dean of the medical school in the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, I chaired a committee established to appoint a professor of clinical pharmacology. We appointed someone who was at that time the youngest professor ever appointed in the medical faculty in Newcastle&#151;Professor Michael Rawlins. Sir Michael, as he now is, has become the distinguished chairman of NICE, and that organisation has done a wonderful job over many years in defining the cost-effectiveness of medicines and other forms of intervention in the practice of medicine. The problem has been that, although the guidance that it has produced has been extraordinarily clear, very competent and based on solid evidence, that guidance has not, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, made clear, been implemented widely across the country.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000023"></a>This is not an absolutely restrictive amendment. It would be subject to Clause 2(3), which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430117000052"></a>&#147;In performing its functions the Commission must have regard to&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430117000046"></a>and here Amendment No. 21 would add&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080430117000053"></a>&#147;the need to provide equity of access to medicines and other therapeutic treatments through the consistent application of guidance and technology appraisals produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000024"></a>I cannot see any way in which the Government could conceivably object to this helpful amendment. If implemented, it would, in general, help with the removal of the postcode lottery; it would assist the uptake of new medicines; it would encourage innovation; it would define the new commission&#146;s competence in respect of  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NICE and external review groups; it would ensure uniformity and consistency across the country of the implementation of NICE guidance; it would help to define clearly the status of NICE guidance including technology appraisals; it would, I hope, ensure that some elements of the NICE clinical guidance were made mandatory; and it would broaden NICE&#146;s remit to incorporate carer costs, social care services, worker productivity gains and other wider benefits and costs. These would be the major advantages of the implementation of this group of amendments, which I warmly support.</p>

<p><a name="080430117000025"></a><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080430117000059"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I, too, put my name to these amendments and I endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, has just said. I do not often pay tribute to the Government, but I do on this occasion: NICE has been one of their great successes. It is interesting that, although NICE cannot be exactly replicated in other countries, because they do not have the same connections or sockets or whatever makes the NHS work, NICE is nevertheless now giving advice and support. Indeed, it is founding an international consultancy to help other countries. As the noble Lord said, it has done a very good job.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000026"></a>Of course, NICE is not universally popular; we know that. On occasion it disappoints industry or it disappoints patient groups that are fighting for the drugs that they feel their members need. NICE does not seek popularity, but it strives to make sensible judgments within the parameters in which it has to work. As my noble friend said, however, one of the drawbacks and frustrations has been the lack of implementation, of which he gave some good examples. I co-chaired the All-Party Osteoporosis Group and we heard a lot of evidence, but my noble friend has covered that. Another example is the three cycles of IVF for women who want to have a baby; that has not been implemented across the country. Then there is rheumatology and the drugs that my noble friend mentioned.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000027"></a>We have to be practical, though. Until fairly recently, PCTs have been strapped for cash; in my area, they still are. They have to set their priorities locally. It would be fair to the population, to patient groups and to the pharmaceutical industry if more information were to come from PCTs, when setting their priorities, if they cannot make something a high priority because they have a lot of calls on their resources. It would be better if they could tell the general public and if there were a means&#151;we suggest that it could be through the Care Quality Commission&#151;of saying where their priorities were and where their needs, as they see them, were to be met. On occasions when they have to introduce a drug and cannot afford it immediately because it is new and expensive and all the rest of it, they should say how long it will take to introduce it within their patch. They should say who needs that drug and how they will make an assessment according to the need. This is a plea not only for some oversight by the Care Quality Commission, as the Healthcare Commission has already taken that area pretty seriously, but for transparency. The local population should know what the different priorities are in their area.</p>

<p><a name="080430117000028"></a>Our pharmaceutical industry&#151;and I declare an interest in that I am not a shareholder in it&#151;is number one in trade surplus rankings. It is an important part of our national economy. It employs some 73,000 people. It spends &#163;9 million every day on research and development and it has discovered 20 per cent of the world&#146;s top medicines. For a small country, that is fantastic.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000029"></a>I chair the Association of Medical Research Charities. We have to be careful to avoid discouraging the pharmaceutical industry, as a result of some of our mechanisms, from investing as much in research. One of the difficulties that it faces is that it takes some 10 years to produce a new medicine. If at the end of that time that medicine is not allowed to be prescribed, there is an issue that needs resolving. There is a simple issue about the funding of the NHS for these expensive drugs. I may well be wrong, but I believe that there is a &#163;1.8 billion surplus in the NHS. Can the Minister tell us where that money is and how it will be spent?</p>

<p><a name="080430117000030"></a><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080430117000060"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> I support the amendment. Others have spoken with great clarity on how nice NICE is. I am a great fan, too, but this group of amendments is important on the grounds of clarity of regulation. We should be giving the Care Quality Commission the tools to enable it to improve the quality of health delivered to the nation. One of those tools is the guidance produced by NICE. That is one of the fundamental tools available to PCTs and everyone else to tell us in what direction treatment should be going. It is crucial that the Care Quality Commission should be tied into a system in which it is testing the delivery of the very best and raising standards. For that reason alone&#151;clarity of regulation&#151;this group of amendments is worthy of consideration.</p>

<p><a name="080430117000031"></a><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080430117000061"></a>Lord Warner:</b> I wish to make a few observations, but first I should declare an interest in that I was the Minister responsible for the pharmaceutical industry and NICE between 2003 and 2005, when of course everything worked perfectly in this area.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000032"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, made an important point about the pharmaceutical industry. When NICE began&#151;I, too, believe that it is one of the Government&#146;s great achievements and a real success story&#151;the pharmaceutical industry was less than thrilled with it. Part of the deal was that NICE should produce certainty. When new drugs were presented to NICE, its set of recommendations sometimes went against the industry&#146;s interests and the industry was not always thrilled by that. But part of the deal was that, when drugs were approved, there was an expectation that the decision would be implemented and that the drugs would be used across the country.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000033"></a>If we are honest&#151;and I can speak only from my experience&#151;we must recognise that we have struggled to reconcile issues in this area. It is right that, after NICE has made its pronouncement, the drugs and, in particular, the technology appraisals should be implemented across the NHS. But we have often had thrown back at us the issue of local priority setting down at the PCT level. That argument has some legitimacy. We ended up with a situation, certainly when I was a Minister, where we wove into the standards that were produced, following the standard-setting  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provisions of the 2003 Act, requirements for authorities to adhere to NICE guidelines and findings on technology appraisals and on national service frameworks. For some time, the Healthcare Commission has been able to inspect against those standards in its rating of health authorities, so there is a link at the moment.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000034"></a>However, under Schedule 15 to the Bill, the standard-setting powers in the 2003 Act are abandoned. We will have a new set of standard-setting provisions and we will need to see what those are at some time in the future. For all I know, the Government may proceed with the same set of standards or amend them in some way. The standards provide for the current commission to inspect against NICE guidelines and to have some expectation of the guidance being implemented.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000035"></a>This is not an easy area. There is great strength in the amendments on standards and on functions but, before we get too carried away, it is worth dealing with the issue of the cost of implementing NICE guidelines. One of the factors taken into account in bunching a group of referrals to NICE is what the cost is ultimately likely to be for the NHS and how that relates to the totality of the budget. NICE guidelines and technology appraisals up to the end of 2007-08 have cost about &#163;1.5 billion. However, we are spending more than &#163;10 billion a year on pharmaceuticals of one kind or another, so the NICE recommendations are a relatively small part of the total spend. We should be a little cautious about feeling too sorry for local PCTs that say that they cannot afford to do the job. Given the amount of money that has gone into the NHS in recent years, we should not be overly sympathetic about that.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000036"></a>There is an issue about how we can make the system work more effectively. The provisions in the Bill may help, but we will still need to truck away on these issues, as we have been doing for the past few years.</p>

It is now sensible to investigate again a number of issues around NICE and its costs and I think that the Care Quality Commission will be in a good position to enable that to be done. I commend the creativity of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in tabling this amendment, which I think is irresistible in relation to the commission&#146;s functions.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000038"></a>My interest in pharmaceutical matters started when I was trained as a graduate at Heriot-Watt pharmacy school. I spent my summer vacations making industrial-scale chemicals for Boots the Chemist; I became an expert in the industrial-scale manufacture of suppositories, which I fear is likely to be put on my tombstone. In the context of the quality of healthcare, my stints behind the dispensary desk at Boots in Shandwick Place in Edinburgh suggested to me that there is considerable confusion about the route of administration for suppositories; perhaps the Care Quality Commission could look at that as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="080430117000039"></a>We had some high-quality debates yesterday in Committee. The weight of influence and experience in Committee is rooted in the care side, but this set of

The noble Lord, Lord Warner, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, are right to talk about the pharmaceutical sector and, indeed, the health service itself.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000040"></a>If I am interested in anything, it is in trying to get people off benefits and into work. When one goes around sister European nations and, in particular, America, one realises that the jewel in the crown of what is available to us in the United Kingdom is universal free healthcare, because it does not provide a disincentive from getting into work. In America, if you try to tempt people away from benefits into work, the block is always that they say that they cannot pay for their healthcare. We should celebrate what the health service does. Of course it can be improved; in my view, this Bill goes some way towards doing that.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080430117000041"></a>Incidentally, it is not just the pharmaceutical industry that is a key sector for the Government in relation to skills upgrading and working in a global economy more successfully. In the United Kingdom, we are developing a professional grade of regulator&#151;the people who do this stuff and do it well&#151;that is beginning to become world renowned. I am talking about the quality of those people&#146;s work and the systems that they use.</p>

That world-class quality is something that we should be proud of and hope to develop.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000003"></a>Of course, it is true that, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned in his powerful introductory remarks, equality of access and lack of consistency are the key questions here. NICE is not the only appraisal system that we have in the United Kingdom. I have already said that the value of the NHS to this country is immeasurable, but it is an NHS that has core central principles that are consistent throughout the nation states of the United Kingdom. It is an NHS that is changing and diverging, quite properly, through the devolved legislatures in Scotland and Wales. New systems are now being looked at and developed and there is a degree of constructive divergence, which I think impinges on the work of NICE.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000004"></a>At the outset, I echo noble Lords&#146; words in saying that I have a high regard for the quality of the work at NICE and for the people who carry out the multiple technology appraisals. They have established a world-class standard for doing that. I do no want to go into too much detail, but noble Lords may know that in Scotland we have the Scottish Medicines Consortium, which does things differently, and in Wales there is the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. These three different systems are rotating and operating together, but I think that it is now time that we had another look at how they are all gelling&#151;if, indeed, they are all gelling&#151;where the gaps lie and how those gaps can be addressed.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000005"></a>Noble Lords probably all know that NICE deals only with the medicines, techniques and procedures that are referred to it&#151;that is, something like 20 per  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cent of the new medicines that come on stream. Therefore, 80 per cent of medicines are left outside the NICE appraisal net. NICE has done roughly 130 appraisals since it was set up in 1999, but multiple technology appraisals take nearly two years on average to complete and cost a quarter of a million pounds each. By definition, the scrupulous way in which NICE carries out those appraisals means that there are pressures in the system.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000006"></a>I can illustrate that very easily. There is a drug called Alimta that deals with mesothelioma. It is a single medicine in its class; it is the only one available. I had better be careful that I do not sound as though I am being Scottish and triumphalist about this because that is not the case. I am talking about different systems and I understand perfectly well that NICE is a different system from the Scottish Medicines Consortium. They have evolved from different backgrounds, so I am not saying that one is right and one is wrong. However, Alimta was available to the ship workers at Rosyth who were clearing out some of the ships that the Royal Navy was decommissioning and who had been exposed to asbestos for many years. They had access to that drug in July 2005. On the other hand, the ship workers in the shipyards in Southampton got access to Alimta only earlier this month after NICE had taken nearly 1,000 days to appraise it. That cannot be right and it must be a matter of concern to the Government.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000007"></a>If the Government are prepared to listen to evidence from the Committee this afternoon, perhaps I may adduce, in support of my case, the Office of Fair Trading report produced in February 2007. The Office of Fair Trading is obviously more concerned about price structuring, which is understandable, but under the heading, &#147;The medium term&#148;, the report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000243"></a>&#147;The cost effectiveness analysis required to form a view on value-reflective prices would be undertaken by NICE, SMC and AWMSG&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000227"></a>So it would be carried out in England, Scotland and Wales. The next sentence states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000244"></a>&#147;The work between the bodies would be coordinated by agreement between the UK health departments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000228"></a>That is the part that is missing. It is not that NICE is not doing the right thing or that the SMC is doing something better; it is that there is an absence of co-operation at a local level. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has referred to this and I can think of many examples that are well known and well founded.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000008"></a>I do not think that that has changed. Certainly in my former incarnation as a Member of the House of Commons up to the last election, I discovered to my horror that hospital prescriptions are all recorded on paper. There is no IT in the primary care system. If you go to your GP and you are prescribed a drug, it is all carefully taken down, analysed and evaluated. Summaries are made to which GPs can refer to ascertain whether prophylactic treatments for certain conditions have proved effective in other patients before deciding whether or not to prescribe them. If you go into hospital and get the same drug, the paper prescription goes into a cardboard file. Therefore, the possibility of

The OFT introduced the excellent idea of value-based pricing for the first time in 2007 and the Care Quality Commission should embrace it as an important part of its primary work.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000009"></a>For all these reasons, there is an urgent need to engage deeply the Care Quality Commission in some of the work of medicines appraisals currently carried out by NICE, the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, is right to say that cost is a significant factor. It is true that the Scottish Medicines Consortium works on a much smaller scale, but it is working within an NHS context because its members are derived from within the NHS and not from clinicians and academics outside it. Indeed, the SMC holds the pharmaceutical industry deliberately at arm&#146;s length and treats it with some suspicion. The SMC is scrupulous about not being influenced in any way, shape or form and about retaining its objectivity.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000011"></a>A great deal of work can and should be done. On costs&#151;and I am not trying to say that because the SMC is Scottish it is therefore the best&#151;the SMC has an annual budget of less than &#163;1 million compared with the NICE budget of &#163;30 million, but there are many issues on which we can learn and share best practice and co-ordinate in a way that is not possible at the moment. These systems were set up in 1999-2000 and it is understandable that it is only now that we can start to get a grip on how they have developed, how they are working and how they can be improved. We have the chance to do that with this amendment.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000012"></a>If the Government are not willing to accept the amendment&#151;I would be amazed to hear a constructive, common-sense reason for not accepting it&#151;perhaps between now and Report they will consider a proposition that has been put to me which makes perfect sense. It derives from the fact that the Scottish Medicines Consortium, which was formed in 2001, took the view very early on that a NICE MTA would always supersede anything done by the SMC. The time has come for the Government, following what the OFT said about value-based pricing, to recommend that NICE should confer the status of NICE guidance on all Scottish Medicines Consortium advice on medicines that are not in the NICE work programme&#151;the other 80 per cent of new treatments. If the Scottish Medicines Consortium thinks that medicines are good enough using single technology appraisals, not multiple technology appraisals&#151;doing it faster, cheaper and in the context of an NHS where primary care trusts are already taking advice from the Scottish Medicines Consortium website&#151;surely that could be formalised. Perhaps the Care Quality Commission needs to do this, but someone needs to investigate the positive prospect of getting some of those medicines and techniques into patients&#146; and users&#146; hands faster but safely. There are ways of doing that, of which that is one.</p>

Amendment No. 21, in particular, is very hard to argue against. It is of great importance to me and I hope that the Government will treat it seriously, think about it carefully and give us a clear answer. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was absolutely right: the response to the Select Committee report, which says that this is something for the Care Quality Commission to do in future, is completely inadequate for the purpose and for the importance of the task that he is trying to address with this important amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000014"></a><a name="80430-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080430125000281"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> Following the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, who is an expert in making suppositories, I must declare an interest because I use them. I use two every second day, which is a very important part of my life. I just want to say in support of this important amendment that, if we can do away with the postcode lottery, many people throughout the country will be greatly relieved.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000016"></a>The Government established NICE nine years ago to provide independent, authoritative advice to the NHS on the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of new and existing treatments and, by doing so, to help to tackle variations in prescribing practice, as has been ably described by my noble friend Lord Warner. As mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, whom we are delighted to see here, NICE has made a great success of that challenging brief, developing an international reputation for its work and improving its performance in recent years, and remains at the heart of the Government&#146;s plans for driving forward quality improvement in the NHS.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000017"></a>I know how valuable NICE guidance is in supporting evidence-based decision-making. I therefore fully understand the desire of Members of the Committee to include specific mention of material produced by NICE in the Bill and genuinely appreciate the intention to support NICE that lies behind that. However, we cannot support the amendments. I will explain why for each in turn. It is the classic situation, as the Committee will realise as I go through, of what you put in the Bill and what you put in guidance, and testing which of those we think will be most effective. At the moment, we think that the words in the guidance are the most effective way.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000018"></a>Amendment No. 21 would amend Clause 2 to require the new commission in everything it did to have regard to the consistent application of NICE&#146;s technological appraisals and other guidance as a means of providing equity of access to treatments and medicines. NICE guidance is of course an important and authoritative source of advice for the NHS on issues of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. I welcome the spirit of the amendment in underlining that fact. However, the amendment is very specific and what it

Factors that the commission should have regard to are not intended to be a list of specific sources of advice and guidance from specific organisations.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000019"></a>To ensure that flexibility is maintained, the registration requirements on which we are currently consulting are the appropriate place to deal with this issue. I have ensured that a pile of these documents is available at the door and I urge noble Lords who have not read the document from cover to cover to do so. I appreciate it particularly because it is written in plain English. Indeed, our first proposed registration requirement is,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000263"></a>&#147;making sure people get the care and treatment that meet their needs safely and effectively&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000229"></a>The commission can take account of the relevant NICE guidance, specifically including NICE&#146;s interventional procedures guidance, to ensure that the most appropriate treatments are being provided across all registered providers of care.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000020"></a>Our consultation document gives examples of how this proposed requirement is intended to work. The requirement on page 57 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000245"></a>&#147;It will take account of NICE guidance about safety and efficacy issued through its interventional procedure programme, or other authoritative evidence-based guidance as to safety and effectiveness (where NICE guidance is not relevant), to ensure appropriate treatment is provided safely&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000021"></a>Let us remind ourselves that, where registered care providers fail to meet registration requirements, the commission will be able to use the full range of its enforcement powers. This seems to be a more appropriate means to address the intention behind Amendment No. 21.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000022"></a>Amendment No. 71 refers to NICE guidance and technology appraisals produced by NICE in relation to standards. Standards in Clause 41 are to be used by PCTs and registered providers as brief common descriptions of aspects of healthcare quality, with the intention of informing improvement effort. I agree with the remarks of my noble friend Lord Warner and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, in this respect. We want wide consultation and discussion on the detailed content of these standards. The Bill, therefore, contains a statutory requirement for these standards to be consulted on and kept under review.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000023"></a>Given our commitment to an open consultation on these standards, we would not want to make specific provisions in advance of the consultation process. NICE will, of course, be an important contributor to this consultation, and material produced by it is very likely to inform the development of specific standards. It is certainly not our intention to undermine NICE&#146;s work by setting out a standards regime that is inconsistent with its guidance.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000024"></a>Amendment No. 88 relates to special reviews. Again, while appreciating the spirit of this amendment, I am unable to support it. Clause 44 already makes provision for the commission to carry out general service reviews, more specific reviews into particular matters and investigations into specific aspects of care. The commission will be free to take account of anything that it reasonably considers is relevant. The provisions as drafted would

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000027"></a>Amendment No 56 would make express provision in the Bill that, when issuing its registration guidance, the commission may make look at compliance with guidance issued by NICE. Therefore, this provision is not needed, because Clause 19(3) already allows the commission to refer to provisions in other documents, including those issued by other bodies.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000028"></a>I was struck by the wisdom of the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, but I shall have to return to her specific question. I am grateful for the opportunity that this debate has given me to clarify how the work of NICE relates to the provisions in Part 1. I welcome the support for NICE and its work. I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee that the Government remain committed to ensuring that the work that NICE carries out remains at the heart of the future development of the provisions of the National Health Service and that noble Lords will therefore feel able not to press their amendments.</p>

I thank the Minister for her full answer. There was a lot that was helpful in what she said, although I confess to being disappointed that she does not feel able to build something like these amendments into the wording of the Bill. The problem with the consultation document is that, although it contains a great deal of good stuff&#151;if I can say that&#151;it is only a consultation and we do not yet know how much or how little of it the Government are hoping to adopt in the end.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000030"></a>However, it is encouraging that some noises are being made in the direction of meeting the concerns that I have been articulating. I felt that the amendments were in large measure going with the grain of the Bill and of government policy, as I know that part of that policy is that the uptake of new medicines should be encouraged and assisted. I hope that we will see flowing out of this consultation something more concrete than just a set of aspirations. I will read carefully what the Minister has said between now and Report.

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000034"></a>The noble Earl said: We come to an issue that is central to any understanding of how the Care Quality Commission will set about its work and what kind of organisation it will be: its autonomy and the extent to which it will be able to operate independently from Ministers and the Government. I come from a simple starting point. If the Care Quality Commission is to be a body in which the public as well as public services have confidence, it needs to be seen as being, so far as is reasonably possible, free of political bias and political interference.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000035"></a>We all recognise that a public body of this sort cannot escape the realities of life; it cannot fail to have a sponsoring department, nor can we ask it not to co-operate with that department or with Ministers if it is to fulfil its remit. I am not troubled by that thought. Equally, I am not troubled by the thought that there should be a reserve power of direction for Ministers in the event that, for whatever reason, the commission is seen to be failing to carry out its statutory functions. The Bill provides for that in Clause 78.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000036"></a>There may also be circumstances where, for a compelling reason, Ministers believe that a particular issue warrants the commission carrying out an urgent special review. In Clause 44, the Bill will oblige the commission to conduct a special review if the Secretary of State so requests. I am less happy with that clause than I am with some others because it could conceivably be open to abuse in the form of political grandstanding, but in the overall scheme of things these provisions are not too problematic.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000037"></a>The issue of operational independence hangs on more complicated and more subtle considerations. We see in Clause 2(4), which is the focus of the amendment, a provision that says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000247"></a>&#147;In performing its functions the Commission must also have regard to such aspects of government policy as the Secretary of State may direct&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000230"></a>The Minister will no doubt point out that that is a form of words lifted directly from the 2003 Act, which set up both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI. So why should we worry about it? I accept that a clause such as this would give rise to little concern if other provisions in the Bill made it clear that ministerial direction was not the only thing that would determine the way in which the commission set a course for itself and defined its purpose in life. However, as we have already seen, the Bill is silent on the objectives that are to govern and underpin the commission&#146;s way of working. Its way of working will be largely decided for it in advance because regulations drawn up by Ministers will determine, for example, the requirements that have to be met for the purposes of registration in Clause 16 and for deregistration under Clause 13. The commission does not even have the freedom to set its own performance indicators when conducting its periodic reviews. The Secretary of State has the power to devise them for himself.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000038"></a>It is often said that operational independence flows in part from having some measure of financial independence. We see in Clause 81 provisions enabling the commission to charge fees for performing its various functions. But it is the Secretary of State who will be

Therefore, at this stage, we do not know how much freedom will be afforded to the commission in that very practical sense.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000039"></a>Schedule 1 tells us that the appointment of the chair and members of the commission is to be in the gift of the Secretary of State. The Minister may say that there is nothing sinister in that but, looking back to our earlier debate on the salary of the chair of the commission, we have already seen an advertisement, which appears to suggest that the commission&#146;s chair will have a status equivalent to that of a medium-ranking official in the department. It is as though the commission itself is being viewed by the Government as little more than a division of Richmond House. If noble Lords think that that is fanciful, they should look at Schedule 4, which covers the commission&#146;s inspection programmes and frameworks. Paragraph 5(3) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000248"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by order specify the form that inspection programmes or inspection frameworks are to take&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000231"></a>What is that if it is not direct operational control from the centre? That is just one example. The requirement for the Secretary of State to give approval to proposals or actions by the commission features numerous times in Part 1 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000040"></a>If we wrap all this up together, can we really say to ourselves that the picture presented is of an independent regulator? You would have to stretch dictionary definitions fairly far in order to argue that. It is against that background that I have tabled the amendment. I am not saying that it is wrong or improper for Ministers to tell the commission that certain aspects of government policy need to be borne in mind as it goes about its work but, in combination with all the other things in the Bill or things that are absent from the Bill, Clause 2(4) reads badly. It reads as though it could be used as an all-purpose portmanteau device for exercising managerial control from the centre.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000041"></a>In her evidence in another place, Dame Denise Platt said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000249"></a>&#147;We think that the independence should be clear. The body should have the opportunity to think, initiate and comment and to be accountable to Parliament for what it does ... I am not sure that the Bill presents that sort of independence.

</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000232"></a>Dame Denise was right. The Government say that they want a strong, independent regulator but everything in the Bill points to a regulator that will, in practice, be constrained in setting its own agenda and be dependent in every sense on instructions received from politicians. Personally, I do not think that the Bill strikes anywhere near the right balance and, unless something can be done about it, I think that we may face some fairly difficult and rough debates on Report. I beg to move.</p>

In the light of what I have just heard, and my thoughts on the amendment, I do not consider that this body will be free of interference, which is important if it is to do its job properly. I do not want to delay the Committee, as we are proceeding too slowly as it is, but I wanted to indicate my strong support for what has just been said and for the mover of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000043"></a><a name="80430-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080430125000288"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I do not want to delay the Committee either, but my name is attached to the amendment and I want briefly to indicate my support for it. I cannot add much to what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, as he covered the matters comprehensively and made an exceptionally good case by referring not just to this subsection but to its impact in the context of the Bill as a whole.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000044"></a>I think that we all agree that we want an independent regulator. I am sure that the Minister will say that she agrees with that when she replies. However, unless we can be satisfied that a regulator will emerge that can genuinely be called independent and which meets the criteria that we all recognise should be met by an independent regulator, we shall find it very difficult to support this clause, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said. In the context of the totality of the Bill, it knocks the nail into the regulator&#146;s independence.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000045"></a>However, I make a suggestion in the spirit of trying to be helpful. I suspect that what is getting in the way here is the wording rather than the concept. As the noble Earl said, nobody would have difficulty with the notion that a regulator, even an independent one, should have regard to government policy; we are not quarrelling with the notion at the base of the clause. However, I think that what is getting in the way is the word &#147;direct&#148;. That is a heavy word. If the Minister could consider that and come back at a later stage with something that softens the provision a bit, I would be surprised if we could not all go forward together.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000046"></a>I have been trying to formulate something but have not yet completely succeeded. Instead of &#147;direct&#148;, I looked at &#147;request&#148;, although I am not sure whether that meets the case. I then wondered why the subsection could not end with &#147;government policy&#148;, and just state, &#147;shall have regard to government policy&#148;. None of us would object to that and I hope that the Minister will be satisfied with it. You could tack on, &#147;shall also have regard to specific requests from the Secretary of State&#148;. That might go a little further and might help. However, so long as &#147;direct&#148; is kept in the wording, we shall continue to be in trouble.</p>

My big concern is that the Government seem not yet to have grasped that, although it is entirely understandable that the focus of their attention is acute health&#151;because that is what they fund and provide&#151;the majority of social care is not funded by government and is not provided in the same way.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000048"></a>I take this opportunity to put on the record that my misgivings on this legislation, and everything that has happened under its auspices, are leading me more and more to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, that it is bad legislation that we should oppose more strongly than we have done so far.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000049"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that of course the Government need to retain the right to require the commission to conduct special reviews and special investigations when there has been a particular problem, as was the case in an acute hospital in Kent before Christmas. However, that should not be a blanket provision to enable the commission essentially to sweep away two years of extraordinarily good work that has been carried out by CSCI and the Healthcare Commission. We are in danger of losing sight of that.</p>

I agree with a lot of what the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said. If this brave new commission is to win the trust and respect of the public and those that it regulates in the National Health Service and in social care, and if that trust is to be maintained, it is critical that its independence is maintained. That is a key factor.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000051"></a>Earlier, we discussed NICE. In the area that NICE covers, no politician has dared to interfere. Its independence has been recognised, except when Patricia Hewitt was Secretary of State, when there was uproar: the NHS cried, &#147;Foul! This is not what you should be doing&#148;. I am anxious that the commission, which will have a wide remit, should also have that independence. Monitor, the new regulator, has much more freedom. It is independent of the Department of Health. The NHS Act 2006 states that the independent regulator,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000264"></a>&#147;must not be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown or as enjoying any status, immunity or privilege of the Crown&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000233"></a>The remit and responsibilities of Monitor, which are very important, are much narrower than the Care Quality Commission&#146;s.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000052"></a>The definition of independence is, &#147;not depending on authority&#148;. Surely what we are all seeking is that the commission should not depend on authority. I am sure that the Minister when she replies will say that it would be very strange if you had a regulator that ignored the breadth of government policy, and the parameters are very broad. Of course that is right. We believe in democracy and at a general election the electorate will vote for the party whose policies they prefer. Once elected, the new Administration&#146;s manifesto commitments and the policies that flow from them are very much respected because we live in a democracy. So there is no quarrel there.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000053"></a>However, as my noble friend and other Members of the Committee have said, we strongly object to the wording of Clause 2(4), which is much too prescriptive.  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It gives the Secretary of State the power to direct the regulator to carry out certain functions that the Secretary of State wants performed. It is not about independence but about control.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000054"></a>Of course there is a worry that the regulator may act inappropriately or ignore government policy, although that is unlikely if she wants to keep her job. If an issue arises, the Secretary of State could well request the regulator to take account of a policy and then make that request public, to use the words of the noble Lord, Lord Low. When we use that device&#151;when the Secretary of State makes a request that is written down and made public&#151;we know that the process is transparent and informs the public of the issues that are being addressed. That seems a sensible way forward. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State always has the ultimate power to change the regulator. Indeed, I think back to when this happened with the gas regulator, who wanted to introduce competition much faster than the Secretary of State in that field thought desirable. I feel strongly about this. We shall return to the question of independence time and time again.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000058"></a>Having worked on numerous non-departmental public bodies and non-ministerial bodies, I understand the need for a balance between understanding the Government&#146;s policy framework&#151;under which, as a member of such bodies, you would be ill advised to fail to work&#151;and the need to be independent enough to express the views that you find in your work on behalf of community groups, user groups or whomever you are representing. Someone will pick me up on the word &#147;representing&#148;, but you know what I mean&#151;the people for whom you are working. That balance has been well worked through.</p>

The exercise of functions in Part 2, where the Secretary of State may specify the programmes of the inspection framework, particularly concerns me. The Secretary of State has every right to inform the body of the Government&#146;s view on how the

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000060"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be prepared to take this away, recognising that most of us who have spoken understand the balance between the need to work within the government framework and the rights of the Secretary of State and the need for that independence that gives a voice to a non-departmental public body.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000061"></a><a name="80430-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="080430125000294"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> I have said on many occasions in your Lordships&#146; House that we are in serious danger of living in an overregulated society. Over the past few years, there has been a huge number of government initiatives, some of them very easy to understand. For example, I was president of the General Medical Council between 1982 and 1989. Subsequently, because that body ran into considerable difficulties for reasons that I do not need to explain, it was overseen, as were the other professional regulatory bodies, by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, another Big Brother overseeing the activities of Big Brother. In various clauses, such as this one, the Bill reeks of Big Brother. It is an issue of direction.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000062"></a>I remind the Committee that many years ago the late Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, said that professional self-regulation was one of the glories of a learned and civilised society and that the alternative, regulation by the state, was too fearful to contemplate. That exact phrase was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, in his Jeffcock lecture to the Royal Society of Medicine in defence of the UK professions.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000063"></a>As my noble friend Lord Low said, in this clause and many others it is the word &#147;direct&#148; that we regard as being totally unacceptable. It would be possible to modify the wording to make it much more reasonable. For instance, the wording, &#147;the Secretary of State may indicate&#148;, is much less prescriptive and much more acceptable. The Secretary of State could indeed indicate,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000265"></a>&#147;such aspects of government policy&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000064"></a>as might be taken into account by the new commission. A modification of that nature is essential, because the direction of the Bill takes government control of the commission far too far and is quite unacceptable.</p>

I seem to recall&#151;from memory, I have not checked <I>Hansard</I>&#151;that I was chided then as being a sort of embryo dictator who was going to ensure that we micromanaged the commission.

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000067"></a>I give the Committee some examples. I recommend to those who want to check them the Labour manifestos of 2001 and 2005, which dealt with choice and targets for improving cancer waiting lists and A&amp;E departments. It is quite reasonable to require the regulator to take account of those obligations in the way in which it inspects.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000068"></a>I am not being fanciful about this, because I think that the Bill can be improved; indeed, I have tabled amendments to do so. Parts of this Bill would not have been framed as they have if I had been the Minister responsible for them. But this subsection does not seem to me to be the right one to amend, because it merely carries forward provisions that have already been made under existing legislation passed by this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000073"></a>As the noble Earl said, Amendment No. 22 would remove the power for the Secretary of State to issue directions requiring the commission to have regard to particular aspects of government policy. I say at the outset that we are committed to creating a commission that is no less independent than any of its predecessors. Clause 2(4) carries forward the same wording as the legislation that created the Healthcare Commission  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and CSCI. I refer to Sections 130 and 131 of the 2003 Act respectively, with which my noble friend is probably very familiar. I think that we would all agree that the current bodies have been independent and do not seem to feel any less independent as a result of the legislation that established them. Moreover, I would say that that applies particularly to Dame Denise Platt.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000074"></a>Like its predecessors, the Care Quality Commission will be an important player in the broader regulatory framework. If that framework is to have a positive impact on the health and social care that the public receive, the commission will need to work effectively with all the parts of it. Perhaps noble Lords will allow me to explain that. Both the NHS and local government social services are public services with significant political and policy input. In requiring the commission to have regard to aspects of government policy, all that we are indicating is the expectation, with which noble Lords have generally agreed, that the commission will respect the broad direction that government policy is driving towards. In the fullness of time, the commission almost certainly will be critical of aspects of that policy&#151;indeed, that is exactly what it should be&#151;but it is entirely reasonable that, in monitoring and assessing statutory services, we should expect the commission to take account of government strategy and the policy objectives that those services are expected to meet.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000075"></a>We need to look at this in the context of the agreement made by the Government yesterday to examine the earlier part of this clause in order to establish the right balance. The relationship is reflected in the detail of the Bill. The Secretary of State will set the registration requirements approved by Parliament and the commission will then produce detailed guidance on what different services should do to comply with those. Similarly, for the commission&#146;s periodic reviews, the Secretary of State will set the overall indicators that statutory services will be assessed against, but the commission will determine the methodology by which it conducts those assessments. Its new enforcement powers will apply to NHS providers for the first time and, although registration requirements will be set out in regulations, the CQC will develop its own criteria and methodology for its judgments.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000076"></a>Therefore, we would expect the new commission to take account of government policy without the need for directions to be issued. However, if it did not, I suggest that that would result in inconsistency and confusion for the public, commissioners and providers of health and social care; indeed, it could undermine the credibility of the Care Quality Commission. I do not think that any of us anticipate that that is what will happen.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000079"></a>Of course, the Government could make a pretty good case for saying that they have not interfered with the Healthcare Commission or CSCI in terms of micromanaging their affairs, but we are legislating here not just for the present Government but for all future Governments on the assumption that this body will be with us for many years. Therefore, what is in the Bill matters. It is not just a question of Ministers standing up and saying, &#147;We have no intention of micromanaging&#148;. We can all accept that assurance in good faith, but we are legislating for the statute book. </p>

If the Government go away and rethink some of the issues that we have debated in this Room in relation to Clauses 1 and 2, there is a possibility that we will make progress in this area. The introduction of objectives would, I think, serve to rebalance this part of the Bill in a helpful way. I am sure that we all look forward to those discussions.

<p><a name="080430125000085"></a>The National Health Service alone spends &#163;17 billion a year on goods and services, and I have not included in that figure social care services, which is the great worry for us throughout the Bill; we are concerned that social care will be pushed down the pecking order. I do not know how much we spend on social care services in this country, including all those provided by the private sector, which will be covered by this Bill. It must be an enormous amount of money. How many people are employed by these sectors? Much is said about the millions working in the NHS, but we must add to that the figure for all those employed by care services, the resources that they use and the impact on the environment. The health and social care industry is truly massive; it is probably the biggest undertaking in this country.</p>

No doubt she will be ready with those figures for us by the end of the debate. I am beginning to sound like Boris Johnson, at least for a moment.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000089"></a>The Government&#146;s sustainable development strategy, <I>Securing the Future</I>, launched only three years ago in 2005, called on new bodies, as they are created, to apply sustainable development duties. Recalling what the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said in the debate on the previous amendment&#151;that this legislation merely implements a government manifesto promise&#151;how can we possibly be denied this small but important alteration to the Bill in order to bring in the words &#147;sustainable development&#148;, which was also the subject of a government manifesto promise? I hope that the Minister will accept the point.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000090"></a>Perhaps the Government will respond by saying that the NHS has a carbon reduction strategy. We have certainly heard about that. But that programme addresses only carbon reduction, not sustainable development, which is a much broader concept. A sustainable development requirement would ensure that the health service used all its corporate powers and resources,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000267"></a>&#147;as an employer, a purchaser of goods and services, a manager of transport, energy, waste and water, as a landholder and commissioner of building work and as an influential neighbour in many communities&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000235"></a>all these things are part of the health service&#151;to benefit health and well-being by investing in local communities, the economy and the environment. Its carbon reduction strategy is much narrower in scope, addressing only one aspect of living within environmental limits. It does not and cannot include a full range of policy levers for carbon reduction, such as regulation, which the Department of Health determines. Indeed, the department needs to back the efforts of the NHS on carbon reduction by including sustainable development in its regulation. This is essential to ensure that the NHS meets the government target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000091"></a>The NHS carbon management programme applies only to the health service, but here we are talking about the Care Quality Commission, which will be responsible for all social care services as well. So we cannot be told that the carbon reduction strategy makes our amendment unnecessary, because it covers only the NHS. Once again, I impress on the Committee our worry that social care services will miss out when the merger of the commissions takes place. The

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for pointing that thought out to me. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000092"></a><a name="80430-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080430125000302"></a>Earl Howe:</b> Whatever the Minister is willing to do or not to do about putting statutory objectives in the Bill, there is a strong case for the promotion of sustainable development to be one of the core purposes for which the commission is required to exercise its functions. Sustainable development is a goal that will endure, whatever Government may be in power.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000093"></a>The NHS alone is one of the largest employers in the world. It maintains a built estate of enormous size and is a vast consumer of energy. We need to think of such things as the management of waste, the use of energy and the use of transport. Buildings need to be designed in a way that will last and that will be conducive to the well-being of staff and patients. Procurement should be not just cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000094"></a>We are living at a time when climate change is never far from people&#146;s everyday conversation. One of the effects of climate change may well be an increased tendency for us to experience extremes of weather, such as the dreadful floods that we saw last summer. The NHS needs to make contingency plans to cope with flood risk and to ensure that services are not disrupted by bad weather. The White Paper, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I>, was clear about sustainability as part of future health policy; indeed, so important is the goal of sustainability within the NHS that I understand that there is now a sustainable development unit operating within the Department of Health.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000095"></a>Some public bodies, such as the National Assembly for Wales and the Greater London Authority, already have statutory duties in relation to sustainable development. In their document, <I>Securing the Future</I>, the Government undertook to apply sustainable development duties to new statutory bodies as they are created; the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned that. Making sustainable development a part of what the CQC is about would encourage it to think sensibly about the use of its own resources, to recognise the need for having a good business case for any proposals that it looks at and to have measurable outcomes in any project that it oversees or undertakes.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000096"></a>I have read with interest the section on good corporate citizenship on the NHS website. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000251"></a>&#147;How the NHS behaves&#151;as an employer, a purchaser of goods and services, a manager of transport, energy, waste and water, as a landholder and commissioner of building work and as an influential neighbour in many communities&#151;can make a big difference to people&#146;s health and to the well-being of society, the economy and the environment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000236"></a>So the department fully recognises the importance of being a good corporate citizen. I hope that the Minister will take the proposal away and look at it carefully.</p>

They will really stuff me if they announce when they reply that that they are accepting it, but I will take that risk. When I first saw the amendment, I thought, &#147;Typical Liberal Democrats&#148;&#151;and then I saw that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, with whom I strongly agree on 99 per cent of matters, had put his name to it.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000098"></a>My concern is not about the idea that sustainable development is important, because of course it is. My concern is with the growing tendency in the modern world to elevate secondary objectives of organisations to the level of primary objectives, including by writing them into Bills. That is a terrible danger, often seen in the multiplication of targets for organisations. If you give an organisation one, two or three objectives, it can hope to fulfil them and be accountable for them. If you give it 20, 30 or 40, the task becomes unmanageable and the organisation may be diverted from its central tasks. Occam taught us,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000268"></a>&#147;entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000237"></a>forgive my French&#151;which means, &#147;Do not multiply beings without the necessity of doing so&#148;. The same is true of objectives for regulators on the face of legislation.</p>

I would be horrified if people outside this Room got the impression that we were in agreement most of the time. I accept the thrust of what he said but, as this is a matter of singular importance, I disagree with him for this reason. In the corporate world, sustainability has reached levels of importance such that it is one of the primary objectives of most major companies. I was sad enough to have read my way through Tesco&#146;s corporate social responsibility report, the bulk of which is about environmental matters and not about charitable giving and so on. Clearly in the private sector there is a massive financial incentive to develop sustainable policies and practices; in the public sector there is no such driver. That is why the noble Lord is wrong to take exception to the amendment. I believe that regulation and regulators in the public services play a role in driving forward an important agenda. It may not appear important to people in their day-to-day working lives, but it is a growing necessity.</p>

Health and adult social care sectors spend more than &#163;100 billion of public money&#151;it is currently around &#163;110 billion&#151;and involve about 2.9 million people in the delivery of services.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000104"></a>As such, through the forthcoming NHS carbon reduction strategy, to which the noble Baroness referred, we are determined to implement a system that helps to achieve our ambition of a significant reduction in carbon-related emissions. We expect to launch a consultation on this strategy in June 2008. But that will be a beginning and not an end. The noble Baroness is right: this is not the whole story.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000105"></a>The Care Quality Commission can of course play a role here. The good news is that the Health and Social Care Bill already allows us to give the Care Quality Commission an effective role in promoting and contributing to sustainable development across health and social care. The publication of comparative information is a significant incentive to improving services and I take this opportunity to put on record our intention to require the Care Quality Commission to publish information about the performance of NHS organisations and others in this vital area relating to how individual organisations are contributing to sustainable development.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000106"></a>Chapter 3 gives the Care Quality Commission responsibility for reviews and the publication of comparative information on the quality of care. Chapter 5 allows studies as to economy, efficiency and so on. Those functions already allow the commission to consider aspects of sustainable development. Moreover, the indicators used for the commission&#146;s periodic reviews could, where appropriate for health and adult social care organisations, be used to promote energy efficiency and broader elements of the sustainable development agenda, such as reducing health inequalities and tackling obesity.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000107"></a>Our 2008-09 &#147;vital signs&#148; for PCT planning include, for the first time, an NHS carbon and energy efficiency indicator alongside those indicators for improving health and accessing effective care. Again, that is a start, not an end. We are committed to working up suitable indicators on sustainable development as one of the issues that the commission will consider in its periodic reviews. That approach may have greater impact than a general requirement such as is proposed in the amendment.</p>

If I may, I shall go on to explain why we do not want those words where the noble Baroness proposes to put them.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000110"></a>The risk with a more general purpose is that it is unclear what would be expected of the new commission and how it would balance that requirement with its primary role in assuring safety and quality of healthcare and adult social care services. We want action from the start. We do not want a long debate about sustainable development; we want the commission to have it embedded in what it is doing.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000111"></a>It would be unnecessary, for example, for the commission&#146;s registration and enforcement functions in Chapter 2 to apply to sustainable development. Those functions and powers rightly apply where care service users are being exposed to unacceptable risks or poor-quality care. To illustrate that point, Members of the Committee would not expect the Care Quality Commission to close down a care provider on the basis of its carbon footprint or its poor energy efficiency record. On the other hand, there are perfectly plausible cases where the commission may quite rightly take enforcement action in response to an appalling care record against an otherwise energy efficient service.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000112"></a>I use that as an illustration of the problem with putting those words into the clause on the general functions of the commission. It is a question of how to build sustainability into the work at the relevant and appropriate moment. We are not convinced that it is most effective as a general purpose, so I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000114"></a>To me, this seems to be the most innocuous phrase.

I still do not understand why we cannot use those words, but we will come back to this.

<p><a name="080430125000117"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I confess that there is a touch of Gruyère cheese about this amendment. There is an obvious hole in it in that I suggest a separate sub-commission for social care but not for mental health. The sole reason for that is that I know nothing like enough about mental health to know whether that makes sense. However, there are many noble Lords in this Committee who can repair that disadvantage and, if the amendment is to proceed at a later stage, we can change it.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000118"></a>Secondly, I suggest in the amendment that only the social care sub-commission should consist solely of non-executive members of the commission. That does not matter now because, if I understood the Minister correctly, a commitment has been given that the commission will comprise solely of non-executive members, but it will need to come out at a later stage. </p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000119"></a>I make it clear that it remains my view&#151;it is probably a majority view in the Committee&#151;that this merger should not take place. I feel a sense of distress that my noble&#151;and good&#151;friend Lady Young, who is a superb person to do this, should nevertheless have to take on something that is fundamentally ill-conceived. Porting from yesterday&#146;s Committee sitting, I say to her and to the Government that many of us feel that making the announcement today while this Committee was considering the issues involved in the Bill was an unwise provocation of the House.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000120"></a>Some noble Lords will have picked up the excellent article by Nigel Hawkes, the health and science editor of the <I>Times</I>. He is the Peter Riddell of that area of journalism, whose word is taken as gospel by those who follow such things. His article in the <I>BMJ</I> says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000257"></a>&#147;Constant changes mean that those being regulated are uncertain what is expected of them. An old regulator, due to be replaced, loses influence. A new one takes time to get a grip. Momentum is lost and, if the changes are frequent enough, can never be regained. That is the pit into which this government has fallen&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000238"></a>Amen. Between now and possibly even beyond the passage of the Bill, those of us who feel this way have a challenge to find suggestions for delivering the advantages that the Government see in the Bill, including the cost savings, without the attendant dangers that some of us are so scared of. That is something on which I hope many noble Lords are actively deploying their minds.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000121"></a>I know this is a long introduction but there is not much more to go. The amendment has a different purpose and is intended to establish, if the merger goes ahead, how we can best mitigate the damage that I and others fear will be done by it. In particular, how can we protect the status and distinctive ethos of social care regulation, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said earlier, is our deepest concern? I believe that establishing sub-commissions of this kind would achieve that, while the overall board could have different kinds of objectives. Obviously, it would be

Will they actively ask the commission&#151;it is delightful to have the chair designate beside me&#151;to consider whether that kind of structure is not the way to carry things forward? That would at least alleviate some, if not all, of our fears about the merger. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000122"></a><a name="80430-gc0004.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0004.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="080430125000312"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I shall speak to Amendment No. 93 in this group which requires the Care Quality Commission to establish a sub-committee known as the mental health sub-committee. This sub-committee would be responsible for advising the commission about the exercise of the commission&#146;s functions with respect to mental health services.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000123"></a>Why do we need to single out mental health in this way? First, patients detained under the Mental Health Act or the Mental Capacity Act who are subject to community treatment orders are likely to be less able to defend themselves than, perhaps, any other patients whose services will be the subject of regulation by the CQC. If you do not have your full mental capacities, you really are in a completely different situation from anyone else. I fully recognise that people with a range of disabilities and problems have their own vulnerabilities, but this is different.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000124"></a>Secondly, these patients are likely to be less able to understand whether or not services are being properly provided to them and, if not, to what extent. They may not even realise what is going on. Thirdly, these patients are not at liberty to change their service provider or opt out of the patient role. As I said previously in relation to another amendment, in a real sense they are prisoners in their environment in a quite different way from most other patients, although I recognise that some other patients may feel somewhat imprisoned.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000125"></a>If we take three examples the point can be readily illustrated. For example, how can a dementia patient who is not being adequately fed or cared for in a nursing home deal with that situation proactively? The same can be asked about an acutely ill psychotic patient on a locked ward who has an adverse reaction to medication and can hardly remain conscious; and about an acutely depressed service user under a community treatment order whose medication is so ineffective that they become suicidal. None of those people would be in a position to pursue concerns in a proactive way, as they would need to do with a normal regulatory regime.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000126"></a>The Mental Health Act Commission rightly operates entirely differently from the other two inspectorates. It relies in a unique way upon visits to individual detained patients to check that services are being properly provided under the law. But the new regulator will also need to consider safeguarding those patients who, from 1 October 2008, will be subject to community treatment orders. There is a whole raft of new challenges that have not been faced previously. Also the new provisions of the Mental Capacity Act are another  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>raft of new requirements and demands. How on earth are the interests and needs of these different groups of very vulnerable people to be assessed alongside all the other regulatory responsibilities of health and social care providers? They will need to be dealt with in an entirely different way.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000127"></a>The Healthcare Commission adopted an efficient self-assessment system with visits limited to trusts that are not coming up to scratch and a number of others chosen on a random basis. But this process simply will not be suitable for mental health. One of the benefits of the unified CQC regulator will be the streamlining of the work of the three organisations, as appropriate, and the reduction of bureaucracy. As Members of the Committee know, I am one of those who feels that, in relation to health, the weight of all these regulators, plus that of about 50 others, has been pretty disastrous and incredibly time and resource-wasting.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000128"></a>There will be potential for streamlining in health and social care. For any individual patients, health and social care are increasingly intertwined, certainly in my world. People move all the time between health and social care and back again, and at any one time they can be using both. An important role for the new regulator will be the monitoring and inspection of care pathways across and between health and social care. That is one of the reasons why in the future there will be a great potential benefit in bringing these areas together. That is the main reason why I do not support Amendment No. 25. There will be a value in bringing these areas together. You do not want to create silos where the potential benefits of the regulator will not be experienced.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000129"></a>I am not arguing that all three parts of the new body should simply carry on as before; that would make nonsense of the reform. Equally, though, it will be important to be sensitive to the fact that the three existing bodies are dealing with very different issues and very different people, as well as different environments, from hospitals to domestic homes to individuals in the community. Only through something like an expert mental health sub-committee will the new body find the right balance between the integration of functions and adequate protection for people with severe and enduring mental health problems whether they are in the community or in hospitals.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000130"></a>The expert committee could make skilled judgments about the extent to which it would be reasonable to adopt a more selective approach to visiting detained patients, those in the community and those under the Mental Capacity Act. It would be dangerous for those sorts of decisions to be made by a general commission comprised of people with very different kinds of experience but not a depth of professional knowledge about mental health.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000131"></a>It is worth reiterating that we have a precedent for this approach in the Equality Act 2006, which included provision for a disability committee within the Commission for Equality and Human Rights. The committee was included in the Bill to ensure that the EHRT was able to respond effectively to the distinctiveness of disability without that specific perspective affecting its ability to deliver other strands of its remit.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000132"></a>I hope that the Minister will recognise that there is a similar case for a mental health sub-committee within the new Care Quality Commission.</p>

It has been widely recognised in our discussions that health and social care are very different. Sir Ian Kennedy made that point in his evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place when he said that the health and social care sectors were significantly different. So different models of regulation will remain appropriate despite the new legislation. Dominating the healthcare sector are large, publicly funded providers with many highly technical services. The social care sector comprises 26,000, mostly smaller, privately funded providers.</p>

I was quoting from Sir Ian Kennedy when he spoke to the Public Bill Committee in another place and emphasised the differences between health and social care. I had not got very far, so perhaps I may go back to the beginning of what he had to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000258"></a>&#147;The health and social care sectors are significantly different, so different models of regulation will remain appropriate, despite the new legislation. Dominating the healthcare sector are large, publicly funded providers with many highly technical services. The social care sector comprises 26,000 mostly smaller, privately funded providers, mostly concerned with care which is non-technical and in which matters such as dignity are at the fore. As a result, regulation in healthcare is more information-based and can therefore be more confidently risk-based than in social care, which is based more on visits by way of inspection&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000239"></a>One can summarise these differences in the regulatory methodology employed by health and social care by saying that the regulation of healthcare facilities proceeds much more by looking at large datasets kept by these mostly large organisations to see where the risks are to be found, and in the skills and experience required in the two sectors. While almost everyone has some experience of health services, that is not the case for social care. There are also complex inter-relationships between social care provision and other services, including extra care housing, employment services and benefits. A whole different body of expertise is required for the regulation of social care when compared with the health sector.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000136"></a>These are generalisations and obviously I am not trying to say that health inspection does not rely on visits to premises and facilities at all or that the examination of data is not appropriate in social care regulation, but what I have said serves to characterise correctly, I think, a general distinction that exists between the two kinds of regulation.</p>

For people with mental health problems, you have to look at the housing, the benefits and all the other aspects of their care, although one can maybe separate off acute health from mental health and social care. One needs to be careful about that.</p>

Forgive me for shorthanding my presentation. The noble Baroness&#146;s point is obviously correct with regard to mental health, and I warmly embrace it. The Committee can see where I am going: I am arguing for specialisation in the commission. I would take no persuading at all that there needs to be specialisation in the regulation of services for those with mental health problems, and indeed a structure to reflect that. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has acknowledged that in moving the amendment. The points in relation to mental health are going to have to be taken care of as we go through the Bill.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000139"></a>Worries have been expressed that social care will be the poor relation of health in the new dispensation that the Bill seeks to set up. There are two grounds for feeling that those worries have some basis. First, there was the specification of the job in the advertisement for the chair that was put out, which no one has sought to deny focused predominantly on health. Then there are the priorities announced for the new body, the Care Quality Commission; the advertisement says that the first priority for the new commission will be dealing with healthcare-acquired infections. I am not seeking to say that that is not important, but saying that it is the first priority has certainly conveyed the impression in the social care world that concerns of social care are being downplayed and deprioritised in the way that the new body is being conceived.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000140"></a>Worries have been expressed not just by CSCI but widely across the voluntary sector. Several significant voluntary organisations, including Carers UK, Help the Aged, Age Concern, Mind, Mencap, RADAR and the Alzheimer&#146;s Society, wrote a letter to the <I>Guardian</I>. I cannot think why the RNIB was not there, but then perhaps I would have had to declare an interest. This impressive raft of organisations expressed their serious concern, saying that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000259"></a>&#147;The new commission must take full account of the particular perspectives of social care in this country, putting human rights values and the views and experiences of people who use these vital public services (all of us, at one time or another) at the centre of its activities. Otherwise, as currently drafted, this bill runs the risk of moving the health and social care sector backwards by setting up a regulator that works to yesterday&#146;s policy agenda, to the detriment of all those who use such services&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000240"></a>Those points were made forcefully in the debates on the Bill in another place that preceded the debates in this House. The Minister of Health acknowledged their force when he said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000260"></a>&#147;Social care must have parity in the new commission. That must be reflected on the board of the new commission and in everything that the commission does ... That point will be emphasised throughout the passage of the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/11/2007; col. 37.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000241"></a>My contention is that it has not been emphasised. The Bill, in relation to the structures that have been put in place to reflect parity between health and social care, has not altered in one particular. Amendment No. 25 seeks to do that. I have no problem whatever in embracing Amendment No. 93, tabled by my noble friend Lady Meacher, as well. These amendments seek to put new structures in place to reflect fully the parity of importance which the Minister himself has acknowledged needs to be given to social care.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000141"></a>CSCI is on record as saying that it would like a social care commissioner on the board, but it is a contention of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and myself that that is not enough. We must all have had the experience of being a lone representative of some constituency or other on a board of anywhere between 10 and 20 people. You are a lone voice. It is very difficult to get your point of view across in a mindset which may come from somewhere completely alien, let alone succeed in winning the points that you are trying to make. It is our contention that we need a commission, not just a commissioner.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000142"></a>Of course, there should be a social care commissioner on the board and a commissioner with responsibility for mental health as well, no doubt. Commissioners on the board should be able to reflect the views and the expertise of the sub-commissions. If such commissioners on the board are to be able to operate effectively, it is essential that they have the support of their commission. That will give them the added weight that they will need and it will guarantee that the board will have to take account of the perspectives being generated by the sub-commissions. If you are a lone commissioner on a larger body, you can have your say, but it is all too easy for the rest of the commissioners to pass on it. If there is a sub-commission, it will have minutes; it will put papers to the main commission; and account will have to be taken of them&#151;they cannot just be passed over. That is the case for a commission and not just a commissioner.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000143"></a>My noble friend Lady Meacher has mentioned the danger of working in silos. That point has been made a number of times in our debates already, but I am not worried about that. Of course, the social care commission would be working in a silo if it did all the work of the regulator in relation to social care, but that is not how I see it functioning at all. The commission would report to the main board, which would have responsibility, not just for taking account of and implementing the views generated by the commission, but for taking an overview and integrating the perspectives of the different sub-commissions. I do not entertain any worry about silos, but the arguments advanced for having a commission, and for saying that a lone commissioner is not enough, are overwhelming. I support the amendment.</p>

One of the dangers we now face is that, in moving forward, we are trying to maintain the status quo rather than moving forward in a new way.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000146"></a>To tackle one or two side issues before going on to where we need to be, I say to my noble friend Lady Murphy&#151;this is a terrible thing, I have done it again. It is my noble friend Lady Meacher. They know that I am mad. I apologise to my noble friend. In her speech she talked about pathways of care, which are terribly important. Those pathways run through whole social strata. Young disabled people and young people with learning difficulties would certainly not consider going through those sorts of pathways of care, because they would consider themselves not sick but in need of other kinds of services. Just as people with mental illness do not see themselves as being in need of the same acute service, there are serious difficulties with some other groups. I therefore do not accept that mental health is unique. All the services have unique positions.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000147"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and my noble friend Lord Low&#151;and although they both begin with &#147;L&#148; I have managed to get it right&#151;I think that we must have movement forward. If you are to look at the governance of this body&#151;that is, good governance&#151;you must be able to set it up in a way that allows it to move forward. The Bill is flawed because we have not had a more fundamental review of services. We have all of us become continually confused in this debate between service delivery and the regulation of services. We are not really talking about service delivery, but regulation. However, regulation must follow service delivery. If we had had that review, we would have been able to regulate for the 21st century. We are currently, to use my noble friend Lord Low&#146;s phrase, going through yesterday&#146;s policy agenda. With that review, we would have been able to look at services as they should be, and the pathways as they should be for all service users, and have them reformed.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000148"></a>I have expressed time and again my huge concern that social care will get lost in health services. We have example after example of what is happening in social care now. Only yesterday, I was talking to a provider of large nursing home services who wished to provide those services as a home, a care facility, but perpetually found himself following health-based regulations. He almost felt that he should have a matron in a small hospital rather than a place where people who happened to be frail were being cared for. That is one example of the kind of issue that we will face if we do not ensure that social care has a fairly strong focus.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000149"></a>I cannot support the amendment because, in terms of good governance, an organisation must be able to think through the structure that will meet the requirements. If we had clear objectives in the Bill&#151;I go back to that&#151;the governance would therefore follow them and there would be greater clarity in the balance between social care and healthcare. I am therefore deeply sorry that I cannot support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000151"></a>Between 1840 and 2008, apart from one 20-year period, to which I shall return, a national named authority has been responsible for the inspection and visiting of individuals detained in mental health hospitals. The seventh Earl of Shaftesbury got permission to extend the metropolitan Lunacy Commission on a national basis. The Lunacy Commission became the Board of Control, which, noble Lords will remember, was abandoned in 1959. Apart from the 20-year period until 1983, during which time there was constant pressure on the Government from mental health professionals to recreate a mental health commission, there has always been a named statutory authority.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000152"></a>During that 20-year period, there were several famous occurrences. I do not think that anyone around this table will need to be reminded of the names of Ely, Whittingham, Fairfield and Normansfield hospitals. The inquiries surrounding those hospitals began around 1962 and carried on for the next decade. The Government tried very hard to address some of the problems with the creation of the Health Advisory Service, which was a very good thing but never exercised visitatorial and inspectorial functions. Although I have no direct evidence that there is any connection between the demise of the visitatorial and inspectorial functions of a specialist mental health commission, it is quite possible that there is a relationship between the two.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000153"></a>I speak as a former vice-chair of the Mental Health Act Commission over many years. I was there during some of its early, most difficult years when it was trying to work out how to work effectively and efficiently, and it was not always easy. When you first join the commission, one of the first things to strike you, as I am sure other noble Lords who have been on the commission will acknowledge, is the sheer complexity of mental health legislation. Those of us who toiled in the mines of the Mental Health Act 2007 will remember the extraordinary complexities and the difficulties that mental health services have in keeping up to date and implementing the right legislation. There are constant case law reviews being thrown at you that you have to take account of, and you have to relearn while continuing your professional development and so on. Throwing away a national focus without substituting something that can provide an alternative seems utterly foolhardy. Therefore, when creating a specialist committee with specialist functions for overseeing the implementation of the Mental Health Act&#151;particularly when we have just changed the Act to make it even more complex, involving community patients and so on&#151;we would be foolish not to try to meet those anxieties.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000154"></a>I take the point that many patients in our hospitals are as vulnerable as the detained and probably also need visiting functions&#151;that certainly includes many people in social care units. In fact, the vast majority of people with mental health problems are in care homes, as they have dementia. However, the reality is that those who come under mental health provisions are especially vulnerable, and we owe it to them to create a system in which there will be a national body within the Care Quality Commission to focus on these special issues. Therefore, I strongly support Amendment No. 93.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000155"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 25, I understand the need, or urge, to look at care pathways and integrated care systems in which health and social care work together, and I understand why we would not wish to constrain the new Care Quality Commission.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000160"></a>I will be raising this issue again under different amendments later in Committee, but I would like to remind noble Lords that the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, OPCAT, makes it clear that where a patient or anyone else is detained, there must be a truly independent body of experts visiting and monitoring their condition. Mental health patients clearly fall under that protocol; the Mental Health Act Commission is bound by it and the Government have signed up to it.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000161"></a>As was said on an earlier amendment, this also suggests that we need rather more independence than is perhaps discharged by the current wording with regard to the relationship between the commission and the Secretary of State. It is clear that we must have a national profile for mental health legislation and its implementation, and that the care of patients under that legislation should be a national function. I therefore strongly support Amendment No. 25.</p>

In the event of the Bill being passed, I should like to see either of the amendments on the face of the Bill. No doubt the Committee will be relieved to hear that my remarks can also be applied to Clause 2 stand part and that I do not intend to speak when we get to that part of the proceedings. Amendment No. 25 goes a little way towards recognising that this reorganisation of the regulatory bodies is a bad thing&#151;I am quite sure of that. We have heard from other noble Lords that social services will suffer and that certainly mental health services will suffer.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000163"></a>I appreciate the Government&#146;s attempts to reduce the number of quangos associated with the NHS. The other day I was sent a list of them; it is quite big. There are 65 quangos associated with the NHS. Twenty have been abolished in the last couple of years so there must have been many more than 25. The Government are doing well. I agree that there are far too many, but if these commissions are such a good

I cannot understand why the Government have done it this way.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000164"></a>If we break again for a Division in the Chamber, the Minister will have another opportunity to check up on the exact cost of this reorganisation, because despite having seen various documents I am still not clear on precisely how much it is going to cost. The three bodies will have to disband the buildings they occupy, whether they lease or rent them, and be set up somewhere else. Staff will have to be paid off and new staff taken on. I would like to know what the costs are for doing all that, and perhaps be told, for example, how many midwives that money would pay for if it were used on them instead.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000165"></a>The three bodies to be merged by the Bill have been in existence for only three years, which is a pretty short time. They have just settled down nicely and presumably are content with their offices and organisational structures. They probably have the right kettles to make tea, which in my experience is one of the most important things. The first consideration in a reorganisation is where you will be able to make the tea and eat your sandwiches. I hope that they have a clear idea of what they are doing. In my short time with this brief I have been impressed by the work of the Health Services Commission, CSCI and the Mental Health Act Commission, but instead of a merger being allowed to evolve, along comes a totally unnecessary reorganisation imposed from above. I have to say that it feels a bit like a job creation scheme for the Civil Service. I have enormous respect for the civil servants in the Department of Health but, as we plough through this Bill, I am beginning to wonder whether it is not just something to keep everyone occupied.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000166"></a>I am going to speak from my personal professional experience, although no one could match the eminence of noble Lords in this House. I worked in the health service for 33 years and I was there at the coal-face. My husband was a hospital doctor working as a neuroradiologist, so my family never understood what he was talking about. But I think they understood what I did; indeed, they used to call me &#147;Barefoot Doc&#148; because I was in general practice, community services and family planning. During that time I was also a chair of social services for my borough, so I saw things from the lowest point of view possible.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000167"></a>One of the problems I encountered during my last 20 years in the health service was implementing reorganisations. It took over almost two-thirds of my professional life. At first I managed women&#146;s services, and then after a reorganisation I managed community health services, but they were reorganised into oblivion. I am still hoping that polyclinics will encourage a resurgence of what we used to call community health services. However, and this applies equally to the commissions as well as to government reorganisation, each new chief executive that appeared had to do his own little reorganisation. They would tinker with the structure, and sometimes it seemed to be something

In my experience, reorganisation is the absolute curse of the health service.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000168"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lipsey, will help me with this since I am supporting his amendment. We had permanently displayed in our offices and clinics the Latin tag attributed to Gaius Petronius, whoever he was, which translates into English as:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000261"></a>&#147;Just as we had formed teams and were working well, along would come someone who would reorganise us and cause complete confusion while trying to give the appearance of progress&#148;.</p>
</ul><h5><a name="080430125000277"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000169"></a>Do civil servants or Ministers have any idea how damaging reorganisations can be, especially after such a short time&#151;three years, barely time for them to know precisely what they are doing? Why do we not merely insist that the three existing commissions work from the same building? In my experience, I find that people who work from the same building, who share the same tea-making facilities and go to the same cafes at lunchtime, share ideas and get together much better. It certainly happened at local level with health and social services workers, so why not with the commission? Why oh why cannot it evolve instead of breaking up three very efficient organisations? I have listened very carefully to what Sir Ian Kennedy and Dame Denise Platt have said, and I respect those two individuals immensely.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000170"></a>I repeat that this reorganisation will overshadow social care and mental health care in this country, because the commission will have to concentrate on the health service. The Government are taking a step too far, far too quickly, in an attempt to look busy. I am very happy to support the amendments in an attempt to retain some of the expertise in the commissions that will have to be disbanded.</p>

I must disagree with my noble friend, Lord Low, about the priority of hospital-acquired infections. With the horrific deaths of people going in to hospital for routine surgery and dying from C. difficile or MRSA, surely there is no point having social care if a patient is dead. That can happen in care homes as well. Infection control must be a top priority. It seems to me that there will be in-fighting within the CQC, so the amendments are very important.</p>

I know that the Committee had a long debate yesterday about concerns and anxieties about the timing of this appointment, and I sat and listened very carefully to all those anxieties and concerns. Obviously, I cannot speak for the Healthcare Commission or the Commission for Social Care Inspection, although I was on the board of the Healthcare Commission for several years, but I can speak for all the staff, commissioners and second-opinion appointed doctors&#151;in total, about 300 people&#151;in the Mental Health Act Commission.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000173"></a>We are where we are with the Bill. Whether or not it is a good idea to merge the three organisations, we have come a huge way; we have travelled a long journey. My anxiety is that I am going to lose a number of specialist staff unless we get on with the show. It is really important that the shadow chair shows some leadership by saying where we are going and how we are going to get there. I understand the anxieties&#151;I have raised them myself&#151;but the next three to six months are crucial in keeping the show on the road for the Mental Health Act Commission and for detained patients, ensuring that all the expertise that we have remains. There is a worry that that will not happen if we continue to raise concerns that might destroy people&#146;s confidence in remaining where they are.</p>

Where we are at the moment is that we have a Bill in front of Parliament that a number of noble Lords have expressed fundamental anxiety about. They are not being flippant. The Bill is not through Parliament yet, and may not pass. What is the risk to the Mental Health Act Commission of losing staff in the event that the Bill does not pass and the commission continues in existence? I do not understand why that should be.</p>

The reality is that many good staff in the Healthcare Commission, CSCI and the Mental Health Act Commission have been jumping ship because of anxiety about what is going to happen. Many are unhappy about it. They see 31 March next year as a deadline, and there are all sorts of concerns. I am not arguing about whether they are right or wrong, but that is the reality.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000178"></a>I come back to the commission and where it stands. The staff have been keen to get some leadership into position and to see what the future holds. I come back to the important issue expressed so eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, that we have always had a statutory body that has looked after the concerns of detained patients. I, more than anyone, am concerned about that. I joined the commission as a visiting commissioner in 1995. Every week I visited high security hospitals and local hospitals and saw lots of abuses of the Mental Health Act on a day-to-day-basis. I was frustrated by what I saw and by what I could not do. I became a lead commissioner and took teams of commissioners into hospitals. We dealt with lots of issues but were very concerned about the fact that our powers were limited.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000179"></a>I became vice-chairman and then, when I became chairman, I reorganised the whole commission because I thought that we were not tackling those  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fundamental issues. A team of us would go into a hospital, find a load of issues that were wrong and then, a year later, because we had limited resources, we would go back and find that more than half, maybe three-quarters, of the issues we had raised were still there; nothing had been done about them. Service users and patients constantly told us, &#147;You&#146;re nice people, you do some really good things, but you&#146;re useless when it comes to my kind because you haven&#146;t dealt with this. I&#146;ve been abused and you waited a year to come back&#148;, even though we had followed it through, because people did not go in.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000180"></a>I made changes at the commission. Now individuals go in regularly and frequently. We have teams and support networks that cater for their comradeship, and people can go in at any time. They are consistent in their visiting. If they come across an issue they will deal with it with the ward manager, the chief executive or the area commissioner. They can even go back in the next day because of the flexibility we have created. It is important that we have created that new structure.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000181"></a>In that body of commissioners there are 107 people. You can pick up the phone and ask about any ward in the country that has detained patients, and someone in that organisation will tell you about it; they will tell you what is wrong and what is right with it and what is happening. I do not want to lose that expertise.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000182"></a>I am also concerned&#151;and this has come from our service user reference panel, of all people; the people we were talking about yesterday&#151;that our role is limited. When commissioners go into hospitals, they interview detained patients in private. That is important, because a lot of our information about what happens to people comes from those who do not want to see us. We find out so much.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000183"></a>We are also looking at how the Mental Health Act is monitored. That is what we are there for. We have to walk past people who may be being treated appallingly but under the law we have to turn a blind eye because it is nothing to do with us. It is none of our business, and we have been told that many times by esteemed lawyers and academics. So for us this organisation is beneficial in being able to look at the whole pathway of patients who are deprived of their liberty but are not detained under the Act. Sanctions and enforcement measures will be available to enable us to deal with these issues. We shall be able to understand why patients are in these places and question what happens after they leave. That whole pathway is very important. I do not want to recreate those silos in a new organisation that is supposed to do away with them. I struggle in respect of Amendment No. 25 in terms of having silos, particularly in social and healthcare, as these bodies have been designed to have a seamless health and social care policy.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000184"></a>I am sympathetic to Amendment No. 93 as it tackles the specialist nature of monitoring the Mental Health Act. This is not about mental health per se. I take on board the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, about people with learning disabilities and others also requiring a pathway, a journey into care and wrap-around services. The responsibility under

It will have a special legal remit to undertake that. I am reassured by Ministers and officials&#151;and by the fact that this duty will be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the new organisation&#151;that visiting and interviewing detained patients will continue on a fairly frequent basis. That is important. However, there needs to be a mechanism in this organisation&#151;Amendment No. 93 would go some way to achieve this&#151;to monitor the powers and duties of the Mental Health Act. That is important. The day-to-day work of the Mental Health Act Commission is to safeguard the interests of detained patients. Even if there is a crisis, that duty will never be relinquished. We will still safeguard the interests of detained patients, interview them and ensure that they receive appropriate care and treatment. I hate to mention MRSA or C. difficile, but if mental health is the Cinderella of health services, they have the potential to be the two ugly sisters that alter the focus as regards what should happen to a small group of patients. I support the concept of Amendment No. 93&#151;I ask my noble friend to ensure that the interests of these patients are safeguarded&#151;but in general I do not support Amendment No. 25.</p>

I wholly accept the principle, having accused the Government on more than one occasion of establishing an intolerable quangocracy in the field of health, that a reduction in the number of quangos is important. But if the Government have examined, as I hope that they have, the enormous burden of work and responsibility carried by the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Mental Health Act Commission over the past few years, how can they possibly expect the Care Quality Commission to fulfil all three functions without the establishment of three individual subcommittees or sub-commissions to look at each sector independently, with the parent commission acting in a co-ordinating role? I very much hope that the Minister will be able to say that that is a principle that the Government will accept. If they accept it, why not put it in the Bill?</p>

Perhaps I may be permitted to respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and make a couple of other points.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000192"></a>Noble Lords have eloquently expressed their concerns that social care or mental health may be marginalised within the new body. That theme has run throughout the discussions on the Bill. I assure noble Lords, as did my noble friend the Minister did at Second Reading and on several other occasions, that we have set the new Care Quality Commission&#146;s functions squarely within the legislation. We have continuously made clear in both Houses that the social care and mental health functions must have parity in the new commission. The integration of the three current commissions will not mean that social care or mental health are overwhelmed by health within the new body. These different and vital roles will be reflected on the board and in everything that the commission does. When the noble Lord, Lord Low, expressed his anxiety about the board some time ago&#151;in fact, two Divisions ago&#151;he built a case about lone voices that those reassurances have not yet satisfied. So again I say to him and to the Committee that board members will have a collective responsibility for the decisions made by the board, whose role is to ensure that the organisation delivers the business plan, as agreed. They will be held accountable for this and they will reflect the three different strands of the commission.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000193"></a>In relation to the comments on creating separate sub-commissions, we are bringing health, social care and mental health regulation together into a single organisation creating an integrated regulator. I feel slightly that one can never please the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. The Liberal Democrats supported such a proposal three years ago, so I would have thought that she would be congratulating the Government on at  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>long last seeing the light. As the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said, the proposal in the amendment carries a very great risk of creating &#147;silos&#148; within the organisation even before it gets to first base. This is what we must seek to avoid. The only way of preventing competition between the different elements is to create a single organisation with overall responsibility for the regulation of health, adult social care and mental health.</p>

Could she address that in her response?</p>

<p><a name="080430125000195"></a><a name="80430-gc0006.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0006.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="080430125000337"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I do not think that there is any evidence to suggest that. Indeed, in her exchange with my noble friend Lord Patel, the noble Baroness suggested that, because he had been given assurances verbally, they would not carry any weight. That is unfair and not quite how we normally conduct our exchanges. I hope that she does not mind me saying that. However, I agree with her about the advertisements, and indeed we discussed the issue yesterday. My noble friend Lord Darzi explained that an apology had been made, the readvertisement had been launched, and the whole thing had been put on a different track. That assurance has been given by my noble friend and I hope that we can now move on to the discussion we are holding this evening.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000196"></a>The commission will, of course, need expertise in particular areas. It may decide to set up committees with responsibility for specific matters. We envisage that much of this expertise will transfer from the current commissions, and the new body will build on this. The current commissions have developed excellent ways of working. Noble Lords have mentioned that on many occasions, and it is indeed the case. Engaging with those who use services and employing improved methodologies will inform and enhance the work of the new commission. Moreover, as my noble friend Lord Darzi said at Second Reading, we attach great importance to the role currently played by the Mental Health Act Commission. We will work with all three commissions to ensure that the body is effective at protecting the rights of all vulnerable groups under its remit. This will include those detained under the Mental Health Act, and we will stress how important it is that the skills and expertise required to carry out the Mental Health Act&#146;s statutory functions, including visiting arrangements, are retained in the new body.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000197"></a>We have made provision for the commission to set up the committees and sub-committees that it feels are necessary for the effective discharge of these functions. However, we believe it is important that the commission, as an independent body, should be allowed to use these provisions flexibly rather than have imposed on it structures that it may not find useful. Here, I refer to our earlier discussion when noble Lords were concerned about the independence of the commission. This is an important element of its independence. It will need to work out what kind of bodies it should set up internally.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000198"></a>I hope that I have been able to reassure noble Lords that we take this matter extremely seriously. The provisions in the Bill are intended to give the new body the flexibility and independence to establish itself in a way that allows it to carry out its functions most effectively. I think that the commission would be wise to look at the proposals set out in the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. They seem to be a very sensible way forward in terms of dealing with the mental health provisions that she talked about so eloquently. With that, I hope that Amendment No. 25 will be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000199"></a><a name="80430-gc0006.htm_spnew30"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0006.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="080430125000338"></a>Lord Lipsey:</b> Briefly, although I can see where it comes from, I do not believe that the silo argument holds water. That is because we have a silo buster built in here in the form of the commission itself. It will be its job to integrate the work of its sub-committees, as happens on the board of almost every organisation of which one has had experience.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000200"></a>Although I give some weight to the staff and security argument, the obvious debating point is that if the Bill were to be withdrawn tomorrow, that would be the end of staff insecurity. The Bill is causing the insecurity and making people think about leaving, although in my experience fewer people actually leave than those who talk about doing so.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000201"></a>Towards the end of the Minister&#146;s remarks, I thought that she might be leading up to giving me some comfort, but that turned out not to be the case. She gave some comfort to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, who spoke to Amendment No. 93, suggesting that a sub-committee for mental issues might be on the cards, but she offered no encouragement of the kind that I asked for; that is, for the commission to set up a sub-committee on social care. Without that encouragement to set up a sub-committee, the fears that have rebounded around the Committee that this is a downgrading of social care will not be dispelled, however many ministerial warm words are poured over us.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>

<p><a name="080430125000207"></a>I take my cue from the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in our debate on 21 April, when he said,</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000269"></a>&#147;I am extremely concerned at what has happened to CSCI, which has been split in two. Half is going under education, as the noble Baroness mentioned, and is in danger of being submerged there under the style of an inspection or audit carried out by Ofsted, while the elderly will remain with the Department of Health together with mental health, which is yet another different  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC103"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>function. The loser in all this is social care&#151;the care of children and the elderly, both of whom have mental health needs quite apart from any other needs&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/4/08; cols. GC 223-4.]</ul>
<p><a name="080430125000242"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s question was a fundamental one, to which we did not receive a proper answer. What is the rationale for splitting CSCI into two and dividing its expertise, as the Government now intend? What makes the Government confident that that split of CSCI&#146;s functions will not result in a net dilution of regulatory expertise and the loss of professional cohesion&#151;the cohesion created precisely because the work of CSCI, before the hiving off of children's services, embraced the whole field of social care, not just one part of it? If the Government intend to bring the regulation of health and social care closer together on the basis that each will gain from the other by being better integrated, why, at the same time, destroy what is&#151;or was&#151;a successfully integrated organisation?</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000208"></a>One has to ask what expertise Ofsted has in children&#146;s social care and exactly why Ministers think that Ofsted will add value to social care regulation. To me, the answer is not self-evident. There are already signs of strain in Ofsted in meeting the health and mental health care needs of children in care. The Children, Schools and Families Select Committee in another place has just been hearing evidence from the NSPCC and the British Association for Adoption and Fostering to that effect. Perhaps we need to remind ourselves that health and mental health represent new territory for the DCSF, the department to which Ofsted reports.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000209"></a>It may be thought that I am raising matters of principle unnecessarily; I do not think that I am. Sparing his blushes, while he is not in his place, I should like to cite part of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, at Second Reading. He said:</p>
<ul><a name="080430125000270"></a>&#147;I should own up to being the Minister who conducted the arm&#146;s-length bodies review which in 2004 recommended that the Healthcare Commission and CSCI should be merged, so it is not my noble friend Lord Darzi who noble Lords should blame&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/3/08; col. 478.]</ul>
<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000210"></a>I always hesitate before correcting the noble Lord, Lord Warner, but I am sorry to say that on this occasion, unusually, his memory has let him down. The document published by the Department of Health on 22 July 2004 entitled <I>Reconfiguring the Department </I><I>o</I><I>f Health</I><I>&#146;s </I><I>Arms Length Bodies</I> contains no such proposal. There was no proposal in that document to merge CSCI with anything. Still less was there a proposal to split CSCI in two. The document proposed a merger of the Healthcare Commission with the Mental Health Act Commission. The splitting of CSCI was nowhere even hinted at. On the contrary, it was explicitly stated that social care would remain CSCI&#146;s responsibility. I shall quote briefly from the document:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430125000262"></a>&#147;The Commission for Social Care Inspection will continue to perform a parallel role in social care to that of the Healthcare Commission in health ... any merger with the Healthcare Commission at this time would be a distraction from the heavy agenda of both sides and would impact on the ability of both to regulate providers and thereby protect patients and service users&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000211"></a>The transfer of functions to Ofsted had nothing to do with the arm&#146;s length review and had nothing to do with any failure on CSCI&#146;s part. Noble Lords may remember that it had its genesis in the then Chancellor&#146;s  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2005 Budget speech, in which he announced the merger of 11 public service inspectorates into three: one for criminal justice, the proposal for which was defeated in this House; one for education; and one for health. In other words, we are considering drastic action affecting some of the most vulnerable people in the country not for efficiency reasons but, in the first instance, to cut costs.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000212"></a>To be as charitable as I can be to the Government, I am the first to recognise that in the space of three or four years circumstances can change in a way that leads Ministers to take different decisions from the ones they first announced, but we need to be told why. We need to be told what the particular circumstances are underlying the decision to split CSCI into two and the reasons why such a split will not run the risk of weakening adult and children&#146;s social services and, in the process, achieving the very thing that many noble Lords have said they fear&#151;namely, the weakening of the voice that social care has at the board table of the CQC.</p>
<h5><a name="080430125000279"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="080430125000213"></a><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080430125000340"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> As usual, the noble Earl was admirably brief and to the point. As he will know, the transfer of responsibilities for children&#146;s social care to Ofsted has already happened in the Education and Inspections Act 2006, in which I think we were both engaged. We were very concerned to ensure that the regulator who was created would concentrate on all aspects of children&#146;s services. Indeed, that is in line with the overall policy objectives and the recent reorganisation of departments to reflect the Government&#146;s wish to concentrate on children&#146;s services and education in a coherent way. At the time, that seemed to be the right way to go in that, if you put together children&#146;s services and education coherently, it made sense for their regulation to be in the same place.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000214"></a>Therefore, the key purpose of this Bill is to integrate the regulation of health and social care, reflecting the integration of the services locally and supporting innovation in joined-up service delivery. Noble Lords have, over a long period, advocated that, and indeed this was the way that health and social care was progressing. The proposal underlying the creation of the new commission is that it will build on CSCI&#146;s good work. The Bill broadly comes from CSCI&#146;s existing legal function and will be able to build on that.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000215"></a><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080430125000341"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I am sorry to intervene but I find doing so irresistible. During the passage of the legislation that integrated the regulators, I raised substantial concerns about the method of Ofsted&#146;s regulation. In fact, I was sent by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, to see the chief inspector to be reassured that the inspection would meet all needs.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000216"></a>What I say next I say simply because it illustrates the concern that we should all have. The regulation of services and delivery of services are different things. It is all to do with methodology. The methodology of Ofsted is very different from that of CSCI. I have found&#151;I say this as a service provider; we have two schools that have been inspected by Ofsted and I have  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>30 Apr 2008 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>personal experience of my local school&#151;that Ofsted regulates by a tick-box method of aggregates. CSCI regulated by looking at the whole situation, so that a variation on a certain set of levels could be taken into account. I think that I have quoted this before but Dame Denise Platt has said that there may not be enough bits of space in a room but if the atmosphere in the home is good, the staff are good and the people are happy, that can be balanced against the other bits of the regulation.</p>

<a name="80430-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080430125000217"></a>I say this now in order to endorse what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is saying: that very different forms of regulation are being put together here. I think that is what the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, was trying to illustrate, and I now understand that some bits of regulation are different from others. I say this so that it is on the record: I am not convinced, despite all I have seen, that the integration of the inspectorate&#151;which was for a good reason, at the end of the day&#151;has been successful in Ofsted. We therefore need to be incredibly careful in ensuring that the methodology of inspection, not the methodology of the combination of the services, is clear and related to the service being inspected rather than to a particular way of doing things that has worked in another area. What worked in schools with regard to education will not work in children&#146;s homes.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000218"></a><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80430-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080430125000342"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The noble Baroness is right. Regulation and the delivery of services are completely different. The point I was seeking to make, although children&#146;s services are not part of my brief, is that bringing together children&#146;s services and education and then introducing regulation of the two was the way that the Government moved ahead. That is what we are seeking to do here. We recognise that the delivery of services has evolved, is evolving and is becoming integrated on the ground. It therefore makes sense that the regulation moves together in a coherent and integrated fashion.</p>

<p><a name="080430125000219"></a>I have said today, and it has been said by Ministers in the other place and by my noble friend the Minister at Second Reading, that that does not mean it is not recognised that none of the three services should overwhelm the others. The Bill allows that recognition. Various alternatives will need to be developed for how the regulation moves forward. That is not an easy task, and no one is suggesting it is. That is why we are going through it in such detail: because the service delivery is evolving, the regulation needs to evolve at the same time.</p>

I recall for the Committee&#146;s benefit her wonderful line at Second Reading that rationalised regulation is not necessarily rational regulation&#151;a line I wish I had thought of and used myself. There is a superficial logic and a congruence in bringing children&#146;s services all under the same umbrella&#151;I would not argue with that&#151;but we are beginning to learn that, if we are not careful, it can conceal some huge misalignments. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, was quite right in all that she said about methodologies.

<a name="080430108000005"></a><a name="80430-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80430-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="080430108000046"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="080430108000006"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas.  All casualties suffered by our Armed Forces are, of course, a source of profound regret.  Our service personnel put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations, and to protect the interests of the United Kingdom.  We cannot pay high enough tribute to them for the job that they are doing, or to the ultimate sacrifice which some of them have made.  We remain strongly committed to minimising the effect on the bereaved families.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="080430108000007"></a>We made Statements to the House on 5 June 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 4WS), 12 October 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 26WS), 18 December 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 112WS), 29 March 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 121WS) 20 June 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 97WS) 30 October 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 36WS) and  31 January 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 35WS), with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners.  Today, we are announcing the progress which has been  made since the Written Ministerial Statement on  31 January.  This Statement shows the position at  22 April, but does not reflect the tragic loss of Trooper Pearson in Afghanistan on 21 April, as the inquest has not yet been opened.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="080430108000009"></a>At the time of the last Written Ministerial Statement, we reported that since additional funding had been provided by the Government to assist the Oxfordshire coroner, 123 inquests had been held: 109 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton (although the January Statement incorrectly implied that all the deaths were military).</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="080430108000010"></a>Since January, a further 32 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.  This makes a total of 155 inquests held since June 2006. </p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="080430108000011"></a>Since hostilities opened there have been a total of 176 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including one serviceman who died in the UK of his injuries.  In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="080430108000014"></a>There remain 27 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007.  The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in 23 of these cases; four of these inquests have been transferred to coroners closer to the deceased&#146;s next of kin.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="080430108000015"></a>Hearing dates have been set in 18 cases.  These include the inquests into the deaths of 14 crew members who died in the Nimrod crash on 2 September 2006 which will be heard together, commencing on 6 May 2008.  In the remaining nine inquests, investigations are ongoing but it has not yet been possible for an inquest date to be set.  The oldest individual inquest for which no date had been set at the time of the last Written Ministerial Statement was that into the death of Lieutenant Palmer, who died on 15 April 2006.  The hearing date has now been set for 6 May 2008.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="080430108000016"></a>In addition there are 10 inquests into fatalities which were repatriated via RAF Lyneham prior to  1 April 2007.  These relate to the deaths of 10 crew members who died together in the crash of Hercules XV179 on 30 January 2005.  These inquests resumed on 31 March 2008, but have since been adjourned until September. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="080430108000018"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction, now that fatalities are being repatriated via RAF Lyneham.  These have enabled the coroner, Mr Masters, to engage an additional assistant deputy coroner, together with an additional coroner&#146;s officer and administrative support, and to provide appropriate accommodation to hold military inquests.  These extra resources are helping to ensure that bereaved families are responded to sensitively and speedily following conclusions of the investigations. Mr Masters is continuing the practice of transferring military inquests to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="080430108000019"></a>There remain 49 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after  1 April 2007.  Of these, Mr Masters has retained 25 inquests, whilst 24 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin.  Inquest hearing dates have been set in four of these cases.  In the remaining 45 cases it has not yet been possible to set an inquest date. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="080430108000026"></a>We remain committed to better supporting bereaved military families.  The Written Ministerial Statement issued on 7 June 2007 by my right honourable friend the then Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Adam Ingram) gave details of the support which was then being provided, and we continue to look for opportunities to improve our procedures.  We have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony.  This has been extended to allow two family members to attend any pre-inquest hearings, as well as the inquest itself.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="080430108000029"></a><a name="80430-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80430-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080430108000047"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Statement.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="080430108000030"></a>Following representations by political parties in Northern Ireland, the Government commissioned  Sir David Varney, in March 2007, to carry out a review of tax policy in Northern Ireland. The review was published in December 2007.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="080430108000031"></a>His report confirmed that the Northern Ireland economy was doing well under the devolution arrangements introduced a year ago. For example, Northern Ireland had the highest rate of economic growth of all UK regions outside London and the south-east between 1997 and 2006 and in 2007 it had the lowest rate of unemployment of any region. There are now more people in employment than ever before.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="080430108000032"></a>But Sir David Varney's review noted that the Northern Ireland economy still faced some demanding challenges. It has the lowest level of productivity and employment of any region in the UK and public spending as a percentage of GDP is around 70 per cent compared with 35 per cent in Ireland.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="080430108000033"></a>So the Government asked Sir David to undertake a second review of competitiveness in Northern Ireland. The terms of reference were:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080430108000045"></a>&#147;Building on Sir David's earlier analysis and agreement from all parties about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland (in relation to the opportunities provided by the peace process, the need to strengthen the private sector, to create increased employment opportunities and to reform the public sector) this review will explore in more detail how to expand the private sector and to enhance Northern Ireland's competitiveness".</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="080430108000034"></a>The Government are today publishing Sir David Varney's report. Copies of the report have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. I am very grateful to Sir David Varney and his team, and to all those who submitted evidence to the review, for this comprehensive report. It provides a valuable assessment of how the opportunities and challenges facing the Northern Ireland Executive in developing their economic strategy might best be approached.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="080430108000035"></a>Sir David recognises the new opportunities that peace and stability in Northern Ireland provide for stronger and greater prosperity.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="080430108000036"></a>The main findings of the report are:</p>
the Northern Ireland Executive's programme for government and the UK Government's May 2007 economic and financial package provide an excellent base for securing long-term transformational change in Northern Ireland;the UK Government have a vital role to play in maintaining macroeconomic stability in a difficult world economic climate and maintaining the current competitive tax system;there is scope for deepening and intensifying public-sector reform, in particular increasing the role of the private sector in the delivery of core public services and transferring non-core services to the private sector in order to help stimulate its growth;there is scope for further asset disposals in order to release funds for extra investment in the Northern Ireland Executive's priorities;there is scope to improve productivity by more intensive use of the main levers and drivers of productivity including skills, enterprise, competition, investment and innovation;labour market and welfare reforms should be intensified to increase the employment rate; and Northern Ireland can benefit from participating further in an all-island economy by implementing the measures identified in the October 2006 report on the all-island economy.

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="080430108000038"></a>The Government welcome Sir David Varney's report and I look forward to discussing with Northern Ireland Executive Ministers how we can take forward the findings in the report together, while recognising that devolved policies are a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and their departments.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="080430108000039"></a>I welcome the fact that the Northern Ireland Budget focused on those Northern Ireland departments that have a central role in helping the economy. The UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive share the view that it is flexible and open economies that ultimately succeed, and that it is important to maximise Northern Ireland's export potential.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="080430108000040"></a>I also welcome the support which the Irish Government continue to provide in developing the all-island economy which directly benefits Northern Ireland through infrastructure and innovation investment, the assistance provided by the EU and the interest shown by the US, as can be seen in next week's US investment conference in Belfast.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="080430108000041"></a>In the 2008 Budget I announced a range of measures which will improve Northern Ireland's competitive position and strengthen the private sector including:</p>
policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, with forecasts of continuing economic growth and low inflation;policies to maintain a competitive tax system. From April 2008 the main rate of corporation tax is being reduced to 28 per cent, the lowest ever rate of corporation tax in the UK and the lowest in the G7;policies to stimulate enterprise and improve access to finance for small and medium firms, including a temporary 20 per cent increase in the funds available through the small firms loans guarantee, additional enterprise capital funds, a new capital fund for female entrepreneurs, and an increase in the enterprise investment scheme. These measures are of particular benefit in Northern Ireland which has a higher than average concentration of SMEs;measures to ensure better access to government procurement for small firms;

Welfare reform is of particular benefit in Northern Ireland, which has the highest proportion of the population on incapacity benefit; and&#163;21 million additional DEL funding for the Northern Ireland Executive as a consequence of increases in spending on child poverty pilots and contributing to the costs of modernising the public sector.
<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="080430108000042"></a>I note the recommendations which Sir David Varney has made in his report. Many of these are for the Northern Ireland Executive to consider. The UK Government will respond to those that are directed to UK Ministers in due course.</p>

<a name="80430-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="080430108000044"></a>The successful return of devolution to Northern Ireland, and the second stage envisaged in the St Andrews agreement, provides an opportunity for transformational change and inward investment which, if seized, has the opportunity to benefit all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003, which apply throughout the United Kingdom, are enforced in England, Wales and Scotland by the trading standards departments of individual local authorities and in Northern Ireland by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. In Scotland, prosecutions against infringement of the regulations are brought by the procurator fiscal. In other words, there is legislation, and an enforcement framework to implement the relevant EU legislation on packaging throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
