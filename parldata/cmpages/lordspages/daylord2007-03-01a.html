Do Ministers not recognise that these two arm&#146;s-length bodies have entirely different purposes, that they are concerned with entirely different issues of public policy, that they address entirely different client groups and that they are concerned with entirely different branches of science? What possible advantage will the Government gain by shoving these two bodies into a single body as a regulator?</p>

Does the Minister agree that, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, this new merged authority can function only if it establishes within itself two committees, one concerned with human fertilisation, embryo research, stem cell research and the rest, formerly the province of the HFEA, and the other concerned with the removal and storage of human tissue and organs and with transplantation? If two such committees have to be established, what is the point of the merger?</p>

It is quite clear that we will have some interesting debates when it comes to your Lordships&#146; House. We believe that there are real advantages in bringing together the work of these organisations. They will clearly need expert advice. The machinery under which that expert advice is to be given will need to be considered as part of our current deliberations. However, I do not think it follows that two separate committees will be needed or that we ought not to be doing what we are proposing to do.</p>

Does the Minister not agree that, whatever body finally regulates this important area of clinical medicine and research, it is really important that there is better public engagement? One of the concerns, which I am sure my noble friend shares, is the ludicrous failure to explain the chimeric embryo. As my noble friend will know, there is no possibility whatever that such an embryo could form a viable organism. It seems to many people that the HFEA has completely failed to provide the information that Parliament requires under the 1990 Act. Can we do something about better public engagement in the future?</p>

Overall, I pay tribute to the HFEA for the work that it has done. There is no question that the legislation that we have and the work of the regulators have been very much a part of building confidence in this whole area and the reputation of the UK. It is very important that there should be public engagement. I am sure that we will want the new authority to focus very strongly on that. The whole purpose of pre-legislative scrutiny is to enable parliamentarians to take a very full look at the proposals that the Government will be bringing forward.</p>

In this legislation, it appears that the Government are going to propose that Parliament should define some limits or criteria to apply tothe testing of embryos for medical purposes. Can the Minister tell us whether that is likely to remain the case, given that the Government appear to have given way on the human-animal embryo research? If it is, how does the Minister explain that, given the enormous amount of healthcare regulation that we rightly have in this country through professional bodies such as NICE, the royal colleges, and clinical and ethics committees?</p>

We have made it absolutely clear that we will be making proposals for pre-legislative scrutiny that we hope will be ready in May. It is now much better to let the path that we have set out take its course, and to allow for there to be full and proper public debate. That will lead to legislation being brought before Parliament as soon as possible. That really is the best way to test out the propositions that the noble Baroness has put forward this morning.</p>

Your Lordships&#146; House has taken part in some really quite excellent debates in this area in the past. On the timetable, as I said, we aim to publish a Bill in May for pre-legislative scrutiny for the 2006-07 Session. As ever, I cannot say when we will then expect to bring forward legislation, but we clearly want to do that as soon as is practical. We are also committed to the new authority, to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred, coming into being in the 2008-09 financial year.</p>

All I said was that these matters fall to be considered when the time comes. I am sorry that I was not convincing. Let me have another go at it. We think that the establishment of this new authority provides an opportunity for the creation of a single regulatory body responsible for the regulation and inspection of all functions relating to the whole range of human tissues, blood, organs, tissues, cells, gametes and embryos. By doing that, we are pulling together the very best expertise that is currently available in the two organisations, to which I pay tribute. It will also deliver a more cost-effective system of regulation. I would have thought that that is a pretty convincing argument.</p>

The quartet is often accused of bias, with preconditions imposed on the Palestinian Government but not on Mr Olmert, who understandably presses for full official recognition. Should the UK and the EU not persuade Israel to take some goodwill confidence-building steps now, meeting its nearly 40 year-old international legal obligations with reductions in checkpoints, occupation forces, apartheid entry roads and illegal settlements to help secure direct talks in the near future?</p>

Some of the issues are of the kind that the noble Lord has just described. It must halt its settlement activities and the construction of the barrier on Palestinian land because those practices are also contrary to international law. There is unquestionably a balance of obligations on both sides.</p>

Will the Minister please confirm the British Government&#146;s current policy and, following on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, say whether we still require Hamas to declare a renunciation of violence? If so, what we are doing to persuade the Israeli Government themselves to renounce violence which has created Palestinian fatalities in the last two weeks?</p>

They are also under attack and that is not to be forgotten. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that if it is possible for the new coalition Government to deal with the quartet on the basis of genuinely meaningful requirements for the negotiations to have any prospect of success, we will deal with all the parties in that joint process. That is, I believe, a step which is well within scope now for anybody who believes that the peaceful route is the route out of the impasse.</p>

There is no question that the energies of those parties need to be engaged. I do not know what will persuade people of any religious community not to leave an area if they feel under threat, but if we can get this peace process moving more directly and rapidly,and can engage religious leaders in that process, perhaps confidence will grow that staying is a real option.</p>

We have welcomed Saudi Arabia&#146;s efforts to broker the agreement between Hamas and Al Fatah, and we welcome the extent to which that is producing intra-Palestinian reconciliation.

If it is closed, 15 people will be made redundant and 10,000 objects dispersed. For those reasons, when a museum closes it can never be re-opened. The sadness is that about 30,000 people a year are visiting it, and 20 per cent of those are people of ethnic origin who want to look at exhibits telling them about their pasts.

This unique charity annually awards prizes to the best young theatre director of the year, providing them with golden opportunities to mount performances at the BAC under the guidance of established colleagues. Surely, the Minister is aware that substantial parts of the audience who not only enjoy these performances but who support and learn from that quite remarkable charity are Battersea residents. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government do what they can to persuade and reinforce the changed position of Wandsworth, urging it to recognise the unique value that BAC has to itsown community as well as to the wider community of arts?</p>

Information obtained from a wide range of sources is provided to asylum decision-makers in country information reports, which are published on a regular basis.

The evidence given to me that all the assurances on which all the EU countries and the UNHCR base this advice is very probably based on the evidence of a single individual, who gains financially from it, and whose NGO, Voix des Sans-Voix, does not have a presence at N&#146;Djili, although the Home Office regularly says that it does. Is the Minister aware that a country guidance case, listed for 28 March, will hear fresh evidence of ill-treatment, torture and rape of returned refugees, both at the airport and at associated holding centres? Will she say that returns will be ceased until that hearing at the end of March? Will she give an assurance that the safety of those returned this week will be carefully monitored?</p>

The fall in applications from the DRC has been 47 per cent.

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07030136000085"></a>Since the heady euphoria of that day some20 months ago, there has been much heat expended but little light shed on the costs of 2012. You will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to add to that heat. It is safe to say that some clarity on the costs would enable us all to focus more on the benefits&#151;and we should focus on the benefits. Why did so many people support London&#146;s bid for the Games? Was it to get one over on the French, to contribute more tax in order to pay for the Games, or to wave our plastic union jacks at the opening ceremony? No, we supported it for the benefits that the legacy could bring. There is an urgent need for clarity now on what those long-term benefits are, and whose job it is to deliver them.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07030136000086"></a>What does our Olympic and Paralympic legacy include? It includes first, of course, the sporting legacy, both the tangible of the new facilities, and the intangible of the participation in sport; secondly, the opportunity to show off London and the UK to the rest of the world; thirdly, the transformation of east London; and lastly, the opportunity to train people in new skills. My primary concern rests with the last two of these points&#151;the opportunity to regenerate one of the most interesting but disadvantaged areas of the country, and to equip its people with the skillsfor success. The first two points are important too, however.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07030136000087"></a>I shall first deal with the tangible sporting legacy, which relates to pristine new facilities. The Athens and Sydney Olympic facilities have been branded white elephants by some, but they were disproportionate to the needs of those cities. After all, Athens and Sydney have populations of some three to four million, in countries of 10 million and 20 million respectively, whereas London and the south-east alone account for 20 million people. Thus the planned facilities are entirely appropriate.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07030136000088"></a>David Higgins, as chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, is doing an impressive job of planning for these facilities, but his task would be made that much easier by resolving the chairmanship of that organisation. It needs a strong, independent-minded chair with solid business experience who can weigh up the complex web of stakeholder interests, while supporting David and his team in delivering those facilities on budget and on time. I am delighted that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has recently advertised this position. I encourage anyone who fits this description, and wants to play a part in this historic event, to apply. I also encourage all your Lordships to work with the DCMS to hunt down this shy paragon.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07030136000089"></a>The intangible elements of the sporting legacy are linked to inspiration from and participation in sport. Although it may be hard to believe now, I was once an Oxford athletics blue. Sport gives people an outlet; sporting role models are an inspiration. A successful London Games, Olympic and Paralympic, can expose more of our young people to these sporting role models, thus inspiring a new generation.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1647"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1647</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07030136000090"></a>If I may summarise in an indelicate way, sport helps to get us off our backsides. It helps address the current epidemic of youth obesity. This of course plays into employability, too. For young, disadvantaged adults in some of our cities, sport can provide the motivation to get up, get out and engage with a world beyond the streets, crime and anti-social behaviour into which they may otherwise drift. We want fewer couch potatoes and more runner beans.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07030136000091"></a>In 2012, the eyes of the world will be on London and the UK. We must prove that we can deliver a big and complex project on time, and we must put on a world-beating show. I have every confidence that Paul Deighton, as chief executive of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, will achieve just that, but the rest of the country needs to show itself off in the best possible light at that time, so that we can attract future visitors and investors to our country.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07030136000092"></a>I come now to the primary area of my concern: the opportunity to regenerate one of the most interesting but disadvantaged areas of the UK, through both physical regeneration and local employment opportunities. The Games can provide a catalyst in transforming this area from a place where people have no choice but to live, to a place where people choose to live. I shall turn first to physical regeneration.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07030136000093"></a>East London lies in the path of the huge growth of London to the east. The population is expected to expand by 700,000 in the next decade. That is like bolting on a city the size of Leeds to the capital. Many will settle in the Thames Gateway and will help to supply the growing workforce demands of the City and Docklands. Government need to fire the starting pistol for investment, thus releasing private sector investment, by funding and building infrastructure. At the moment, the Olympics are the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. If noble Lords think that regeneration sounds like a strange focus for this department, then I agree. It demands action from the Department of Health to build health facilities, from the education department to build schools, from the Department for Transport to build bridges, and so on. Top athletes achieve their goals through ruthless focus. You win at team sports by having an inspirational captain. What we need is a Cabinet-level Minister totally focused on achieving the legacy as well as the Games and who has the skills to lead a talented group of individuals from across all the agencies involved.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07030136000094"></a>Finally, we must aim for a lasting impact on skills and employability. London has unemployment of8.2 per cent at the moment. That is the highest of any English region and is shocking for a city which is currently booming to the point where it is threatening New York. Unemployment in the Olympic boroughs is far higher; indeed, in some wards less than 50 per cent of the working-age population is economically active. The Olympics will have succeeded only if those without work in east London and elsewhere win some of the jobs connected to the Games, from hard-hat plasterer to chef&#146;s-hat caterer, from receptionist to translator. That success will be embedded if, having serviced the Games, they can take those skills and experience into permanent full-time employment. I would like to see between now and 2012 every

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07030136000095"></a>The public agencies in turn need to put behind them their historic turf battles and work together to make these people just that bit more employable. Private and pubic sectors need to work together too, to find pragmatic solutions that suit both employer and employee. After all, working together is a guiding principle of both business and sport.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07030136000096"></a>I began by looking back to 2005. If I may, I would like to take noble Lords back still further. We can and should learn from past experience, such as the rebuilding of London after the war. Coincidentally, the 1948 Olympics were a triumph for London&#151;they also heralded the forerunner of our current Paralympics&#151;as were the Docklands developments of the 1980s. I do not have some noble Lords&#146; memories of post-war London but I can just about remember the Docklands developments. So what are the learning points for our current Olympic project?</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07030136000097"></a>The London Docklands Development Corporation had independence, resources and influence. It was able to pursue its vision with the minimum of interference. I know that sometimes it seemed to ride roughshod over local sensibilities, and I am not necessarily advocating such a headstrong approach, but the LDDC was effective.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07030136000098"></a>So where is the equivalent body with responsibility for regeneration centred around the Olympics? The relatively recently created London Thames Gateway Development Corporation oversees regeneration in the neighbourhood of the Olympic Park, but it has much less power, much less resource and much less influence over the long-term future of the Olympic site. To create a realistic catalyst for action, national, London and local government need to put their support behind a strengthened Thames Gateway development corporation, with an extended life to 2020. Answering the question about who is in charge of regeneration of this area between 2012 and 2020 is fundamental to locking in the legacy for east London.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07030136000099"></a>What can we learn from the Millennium Dome? It is a beautiful building, built on budget and on time. Clearly, these measures alone are not sufficient for success. From the moment of the Dome&#146;s conception, its future beyond 2000 was nobody&#146;s responsibility. We must not repeat that mistake. Now the 02 is committed to employing local people in the repurposing of the Dome site, but far more benefits could have been achieved at much lower cost if the future of the Dome had been thought about and planned while it was being built.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07030136000100"></a>These two examples lend themselves to a final point; that of the role of transport infrastructure in maximising regenerative impact. The original Docklands developments were unlocked by the Docklands Light Railway. Without the DLR, Canary Wharf would have been an unattractive investment location, separated from customers, workforce and community. Indeed, without the DLR, Canary Wharf simply would not have happened. Similarly, the Dome created a deadline for completion of the Jubilee Line extension, unlocking additional regeneration potential in both the Greenwich peninsula and the Isle of Dogs.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07030136000101"></a>At the risk of gaining a reputation for railing crossly about Crossrail, I return to it again. Without proper transport infrastructure in the gateway there is little opportunity for sustained investment in sustainable communities. Crossrail is far and away the most effective investment. It enables higher density housing to be built, accessible to the thousands of jobs in central London, and provides land value uplift, which enables imaginative and affordable master-planning of areas in the gateway.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07030136000102"></a>To conclude, London and the UK fought hard to win the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. They did so with good reason. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity not just to host the greatest sporting festival in the world&#146;s calendar, but to bring lasting change to the physical fabric of east London and to the fortunes of some of Britain&#146;s most disfranchised citizens.</p>

<a name="70301-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07030136000103"></a>If the Games are a success and their legacy endures, London and the nation will have much more than memories once the spectators, the journalists, the sportsmen and women, the medals and the torch have gone home. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07030136000106"></a>I am also delighted that the Government placed such strong emphasis on the regeneration aspects of the Games. The Lower Lea is in tremendous need of such regeneration and the Olympic Park itself will be located within some of the UK&#146;s most disadvantaged boroughs. The Prime Minister underlined this when he said in welcoming the Games:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07030136000255"></a>&#147;But as well as being a wonderful sporting and cultural festival, the Games would also deliver benefits for the capital and the country. They would drive the environmentally-friendly regeneration and rejuvenation of East London, give a huge boost for tourism across the UK and provide thousands of new opportunities for work and volunteering&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70301-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07030136000107"></a>I think that we all share that sentiment. My contribution to this debate will focus on the physical regeneration and legacy aspects of the Games. I am not an expert in the economics of staging Olympic Games but I lay claim to some knowledge and expertise in delivering large-scale, complex regeneration projects. I declare an interest as chairman of English Partnerships for the past five years, the national regeneration agency, although we have no locus on the Olympic project as such. But over the past five years I have worked very closely with colleagues to deliver a diverse range of regeneration and development projects: from the regeneration of the entire English coalfield over the past 10 years, to the reclamation of the Greenwich  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1650"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1650</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>peninsula, the redevelopment of King&#146;s Dock in Liverpool, and so on. We are currently working on a portfolio of more than 50 such projects across England, many of which bear striking similarities to the legacy and regeneration aspects of the Olympics project.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07030136000108"></a>So it is from a basis of experience that I consider the way in which investment in regeneration is being planned and offer my noble friend the Minister some thoughts on how best to secure the regeneration that we all desperately want to see. Evaluation of other Games, whether Olympic or Commonwealth, concludes that, like the curate&#146;s egg, they tended to be good in parts. I suspect that other noble Lords who will speak today will be more familiar than me with the outcome of the Manchester Commonwealth Games. But certainly the events in Sydney and Barcelona&#151;both billed as regeneration Games&#151;did deliver most of the economic and some of the social benefits that were promised.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07030136000109"></a>It is probably worth noting that just over 9 per cent of the Barcelona investment went on sports infrastructure and facilities and the remainder on classic regeneration and public realm projects. That city has moved from being the 18th to the third most visited in Europe after London and Paris. So in many ways it &#147;did what it said on the tin&#148; for Barcelona.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07030136000110"></a>Sydney is probably the most impressive legacy. Independent evaluation suggests that the Games delivered some $3 billion Australian in business outcomes,$2 billion in post-Games sports infrastructure and service contracts, an injection of more than $6 billion in infrastructure developments across New South Wales, more than $6 billion in inbound tourism spending during 2001 and a greatly enhanced business profile for Sydney and New South Wales through the equivalent of up to $6 billion Australian of international exposure.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07030136000111"></a>At the heart of the direct preparations for the Sydney Games were additions to its sporting and entertainment infrastructure through the construction of Olympic venues. Perhaps the most visible legacy of the Games is the new suburb of Newington, home for the Olympic athletes during the Games, and the Sydney Olympic Park. However, there are some outstanding legacy issues. The stadium, initially heralded as one of the best Olympic venues ever created, has presented the City with a white elephant as there were no long-term users identified for the stadium and it continues, sadly, to be used for one-off sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07030136000112"></a>Nevertheless, Sydney is a very good model and we should be pleased that David Higgins is chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority. He was a close colleague of mine for three years at English Partnerships. David was a key player in the construction element of the Sydney Games and learnt a huge amount there. We should also be pleased that his board at the ODA and senior team have extensive experience in complex regeneration projects.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07030136000113"></a>However, we should challenge the client side of the 2012 Games&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, has explained the tapestry of players there&#151;to create the conditions to enable the ODA to succeed, for the resources being committed are immense, and I do not use that word lightly. Like other noble Lords, I suspect, I rarely pay much attention to local press  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1651"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reports on so-called Olympic costs. I am sure that when they are ready and it is appropriate, the Government will set the correct budget. However, if reported figures of &#163;1.8 billion for regeneration costs alone are anywhere near the mark, I urge the Minister to be very demanding in what is delivered for that level of investment.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07030136000114"></a>There are very well developed methodologies in linking investment to outcomes: methodologies, for example, adopted by Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury, endorsed by the National Audit Office and widely used across England by English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation, the regional development agencies and the 23 urban regeneration companies. For &#163;1.8 billion, the Government should expect a very heavy basket of outputs that includes, in terms of current methodologies, buying more than 45,000 homes, even building in the London affordability cost, and more than 2 million square feet of employment floor space. They should expect leverage from the private sector of up to&#163;10 billion and land receipts of &#163;1.5 billion for that level of investment. I stress that I am sure these are reported costs, and the Minister may tell me that they are not exact costs. If they are near the mark, that is the kind of basket of outputs that the Government would routinely demand of regeneration investment elsewhere in England.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07030136000115"></a>Even if we temper those with an Olympics premium, which is valid, and if we temper those with all the construction built at the new sustainable buildings code at level 3, and if we temper it with ambitious family and affordable housing policies, we should still demand an excellent regeneration outcome. For25 years, we have learnt how to deliver complex regeneration; economic, social, environmental&#151;real sustainable regeneration. I dearly hope that the 2012 Olympics will build on that experience, and the Government should demand that this is so.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, for her opening remarks to set the scene, but I will try to correct her on one point. Yes, the building of the Dome was completed nearly on budget, at an over-run of only 2.5 per cent. It would actually have been a very substantial improvement on budget had it not been for some of the more unfortunate government controls on how the process was run. There would have been a saving of some tens of millions without the interference of the Government. The over-run on the Dome all occurred in the management costs and the running of the Dome and of its ancillary services. It was something like 45 per cent over budget on that section, resulting eventually in what amounts to an &#163;811 million learning curve for the Government, which I sincerely hope they will be marking and using extensively in the lessons for the Olympics.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07030136000117"></a>When we heard that the Olympics were beginning to be a very real possibility, the group of senior management who worked with me over the last four months to keep the Dome operating and then through  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1652"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the following year to bring about its final solvent liquidation decided to have an away day together to think about what we might like to suggest to the Government would be the lessons that they should most take from the Dome. We wrote that up into a paper, which we sent to the then-Permanent Secretary at the DCMS, Dame Sue Street, and to Sir John Bourn at the National Audit Office. We were very gratified when shortly afterwards both those parties decided that we should have a day together to debate the paper. We presented our paper to Dame Sue and Sir John and eventually in the fullness of time a report was published on 2 February, which in the main encapsulates almost all the recommendations that we made. We were very gratified.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07030136000118"></a>However, there were four sections in which the report watered down our advice or eliminated it altogether. I will highlight those points today, because they are potentially the subject of an enormous waste of money in the process of the Olympics as time goes forward. First, the most persistent problem that the Dome had was to sustain solvent trading at all stages, and solvency, if you have not got it, is extremely expensive in commercial consequences. Secondly, there is the use of consultants. I know that there is a big budget for consultants at present but, like the leaves that regularly stop railway trains in bad weather, they are the wrong consultants in the main. I will go into that in a bit more detail.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07030136000119"></a>Thirdly, there is the obstacle race that the Government impose on the sensible contracting-out of essential services. The Government believe that they can do anything better and cheaper than everybody else, and the Government are emphatically wrong. Finally, there is sponsorship, which is a frightening area. A big budget is assumed for sponsorship, as there was at the Dome. If the same shortfall on sponsorship achieved occurs in the Olympics as happened at the Dome, you will immediately need to add half a billion pounds on to the budget now because that will be the shortfall cost.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07030136000120"></a>The problems with the shortfall of the realisation of sponsorship are the first lesson that should be learnt because you have to get your sponsorship very early. The Government should be doing it now. The problem with the sponsorship was that the Government never had a single, standard set of rules for every sponsor, so any sponsor could come along and negotiate what he wanted. For example, McDonald&#146;s was certainly coming in with a big budget. But no one realised until July the following year that McDonald&#146;s was going to send the Dome a &#163;5 million bill for building its restaurant on the Dome site. That made rather a big hole in the sponsorship it had received.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07030136000121"></a>Similarly, British Airways and BT both insisted on providing their own staff and then deducted the entire payroll of the staff they gave to man the zones at the Dome from the value of the sponsorship they were giving. As a result of it there was absolutely no cash value left over for the Government. These are the sorts of the things that have to be standardised and kept clear for the future.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07030136000122"></a>Then there is the question of sub-contracting. You need a lot of sub-contractors to run 14 major sporting events simultaneously. The sub-contracting in the Dome  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1653"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1653</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>covered everything from maintenance right the way through. In fact, sub-contracting produced the only successfully accomplished fraud&#151;well it was successful until they went to prison&#151;that was mounted against the Dome. This arose from the lunatic&#151;forgive the word&#151;refusal of the Government to allow a very small expenditure of only a few thousand pounds to have the vetting process for sub-contractors done by a professional body rather than doing it by an ad hoc group created within. As a result, they took on a maintenance operator for the lighting function who did not exist and they did not notice it. They succeeded in giving this operator the right to generate its own invoices and then sanction them for payment, with the result that &#163;3 million went through the door.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07030136000123"></a>Another major problem was they did not, until we had been open for three months, decide that they needed to sell tickets at the gates and they had not got any turnstiles. Turnstiles for the Olympics are not mentioned anywhere in the report. But turnstile operation must not be attempted by government again. We became suspicious of the failure of our own turnstile operations only when one of our turnstile operators was wheeling a Tesco trolley across the forecourt one night and he was hit by a gust of wind which overturned him, bursting the sack on top of his trolley, causing more than &#163;2,000 worth of &#163;20 notes to blow across the concourse. We had 22 turnstiles and it was reckoned that three of them were operating on that basis more or less every day. We do not know how much we lost down that avenue.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07030136000124"></a>There needs to be a willingness to bend the rules which currently prohibit government bodies from contracting out. At the meeting we had, the National Audit Office said, &#147;That&#146;s no problem with us and there won&#146;t be a problem with the Public Accounts Committee if it&#146;s explained to them too, but it needs Government to sanction the rules by which the consultants can be applied&#148;. Another crazy consulting rule that the Government have is that if you have already used one consultant successfully, then you must not use him again, which is a bit self-defeating. Because if you use him again you are showing favouritism, so you must share it around to the next one in line. This means that you have got to pay the next one extra fees to go through the learning curve of understanding what needs to be done. This is folly unrestricted.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07030136000125"></a>All of this leads us back to what is for me still the biggest and most important issue and the one which cost us so much money at the Dome. That is the refusal of Government to allow the contracting out of certain key financial control functions. The first and worst of those was that they dictated that for every unit to be delivered each would have to have the maintenance of its own bought ledger. For the Dome, it was obviously one delivery unit to delivered, but you will have something like 14 separate corporate entities created to deliver each of the stadia for the Olympics.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07030136000126"></a>The bought ledger at the Dome was a complete and utter catastrophe. One day, when I had been at the Dome about a month, I had a phone call from an individual who said, &#147;I really just wanted to thank you, as the new chairman, for the &#163;100,000 I received  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1654"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1654</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>yesterday and ask you to assure me that it is safe for me to spend it&#148;. I said, &#147;What is it for?&#148;; he said, &#147;It is the &#163;100,000 you send me every month&#148;; I said, &#147;That is very interesting. What do you get it for?&#148;; he said, &#147;Well, we could not balance our invoices with you at the back-end of last year and we were not going to continue to finish the building, so Jenny Page agreed we could have &#163;100,000 every month just to keep us going and that we would sort out the invoices later&#148;. I asked, &#147;And have we sorted them out yet?&#148;; &#147;Oh, no&#148;, he said, &#147;But you keep sending me &#163;100,000 every month, which I do appreciate&#148;.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07030136000127"></a>All the suppliers had been divided into &#163;100,000 suppliers and &#163;50,000 suppliers and each month, according to which side of that lucky dip they came, the suppliers were being sent a cheque. At the time, we had outstanding an assumed liability of &#163;35 million in unresolved invoices. We did not have a clue what they stood for or whether the work had actually been performed, as another problem was that the structure had not allowed for quantity surveyors to be contracted, so there was no means whatever of establishing the validity of the work that was subject to the invoices that were coming in. That was bad enough for the Dome, but if we are to have 14 such projects going at the same time, can we please have committed, contracted quantity surveyors running through the organisation?</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07030136000128"></a>Those are the main points. If we do not do that, we shall have insolvency in every one of the 14 operations and we shall have a complete and utter disaster. It does not have to be so, but the Government need to make some changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07030136000130"></a>As a Mancunian, I witnessed the very successful Commonwealth Games and I am very conscious of the legacy that they left for Manchester. I summarise the legacy as the three &#147;p&#148;s&#151;perception, physical and pride. By perception I mean the way in which Manchester is seen as a vibrant city, with hotel developments, and the fact that the major parties now hold their conferences there; by physical I mean the stadium, which is now used by Manchester City, and the swimming pool development; and by pride I mean the huge morale booster for Mancunians that those successful Commonwealth Games left to the city. Many now believe that Manchester's successful hosting of the Games played a key part in London getting the 2012 Olympics. I am sure that the London Olympics can, and will be, as great a success as the Commonwealth Games were for Manchester and will give a huge boost to our nation.</p>

In many ways, one would like the London 2012 Olympics to be called &#147;the legacy Olympics&#148;, because it would focus our minds on the long-term benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07030136000132"></a>I am sure that in subsequent contributions a number of my colleagues will focus on issues ranging from regeneration of east London, transport and sporting legacy to employment and skills. As a former Tourism Minister, and chairman of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions&#151;the million-visitor-a-year club and essentially the jewels in our national tourism crown&#151;I would like to focus on the tourism dimension of the Games, tourism being our fifth-largest industry.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07030136000133"></a>London 2012 provides a unique opportunity to project globally our national image and our great cultural heritage, not just for the short duration of the Games themselves&#151;the number of tourists during the Games may well fall as compared with other years&#151;but also for the enormous tourism opportunity pre- and post-2012. I am very conscious that there is a lot of scepticism in the regions about the coming Olympics; they do not really feel part of them. The more tourists we bring to this country, the greater the benefits for the regions as tourists stay here longer and visit many other parts of the UK.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07030136000134"></a>I do not wish to dwell on negatives today; we want this to be an optimistic, positive debate. I certainly do not wish to overdwell on party politics. We cannot afford for much longer the festering dispute over funding which, by way of example, dominated yesterday&#146;s <I>Evening Standard</I>. It is up to Gordon Brown, as Chancellor, to grip the funding issue. He cannot hide behind the skirts of the DCMS for much longer; we need closure on this issue. The disputes and negotiations between the Treasury, the DCMS and London must be brought to a close shortly, or we will all suffer. The suggested cost of &#163;9 billion is obviously a large sum. Put in comparable terms, it equates to the likely cost of10 new Wembley stadiums or the profits announced today by the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, it is all well within our national capability, particularly given that national pride is at stake.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07030136000135"></a>I want to make two points about funding. First, because we are running overbudget, we must not lose our nerve or skimp on the design and quality of the Olympic structures. We must take the long view. Secondly, as the majority of spending will be of a capital nature, we must adequately support that capital expenditure with a view to bringing in more tourists by means of some realistic revenue spending. It is surely madness for the Government, at present, to consider cutting in real terms the budget of VisitBritain. The marketing budget of VisitBritain is currently ranked 26th in the United States, our most important tourism market. Ireland spends four times as much.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07030136000136"></a>It is also absurd for the Government to reduce the British Waterways budget at this time because of problems with Defra. Nevertheless, I was delighted yesterday to read about the development of our canal network in east London, to the long-term benefit of sport, tourism and carrying materials to the Olympic site. We also need to consider increasing spending on our great museums, opening new galleries, developing exciting new exhibitions and providing the funds for new purchases for our great museums and galleries. I say to Ministers that we need rather more joined-up government to support London 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07030136000137"></a>Monday 12 March will be the start of British tourism week, under the patronage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. This is designed to raise the profile of our great tourism and hospitality industry, and to demonstrate what we have to offer to visitors. With only limited resources, VisitBritain operatesin only 36 markets from 23 overseas offices, but approximately 200 countries will compete in the 2012 Olympics. There is a major challenge in projecting our image. Ideally, we need some form of presence in all those countries. In particular, I suggest using and promoting the British Council, which has a presence in 109 of those countries, and perhaps creating Olympic ambassadors in the remainder.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07030136000138"></a>In about 18 months, the Olympic banner will be passed to the United Kingdom from Beijing. Parallel to that, Liverpool will be the city of culture. The world&#146;s media will then be focused on the United Kingdom and the 2012 Olympics. It is essential that those correspondents who come here enjoy their United Kingdom experience and report back favourably. They want to see real progress on construction and transport infrastructure; they want value for money as visitors. Above all they want, and must receive, a warm welcome. Each of us has a duty to be an ambassador for our country and the London 2012 Olympics from now on. There is every opportunity for the 2012 Olympics to be a great success and for the United Kingdom to benefit from our raised profile in tourism. I hope we will all be able to take pride in the 2012 Olympics and the positive legacy that will undoubtedly follow.</p>

He came from Burma, and in front of me was a multicultural congregation. There was a palpable sense of celebration and joy at the thought of the Olympics coming into their community. A very large portion of the Olympic site lies in my diocese. I and my colleagues, the right reverend Prelates the Bishop of Southwark, who is here today, and the Bishop of London, in collaboration with our ecumenical partners, seek to put a structure in place in the churches and the faith communities to ensure that we, too, think about how the legacy works out and how we can play our part in this great event.</p>

<a name="70301-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07030136000140"></a>It is worth remembering, without taking anything away from all those who promoted the bid, that the children of east London played a significant part in the final stages of winning the bid for London. It is important that they and their generation are the people who benefit from the Games arriving in our capital city. I hope that your Lordships will forgive me for talking for a moment or two about the wider cultural, social and spiritual issues at stake, in terms of regeneration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07030136000141"></a>Will this event seriously take account of the context in which it is to be set? The London Borough of Newham is probably one of the most multicultural boroughs in Europe; it is certainly one of the youngest communities in Europe. As an east London borough, it contains quite a high proportion of children and

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07030136000142"></a>Last year we had the incidents of people being arrested in Stratford on terrorist charges, and all the issues of the image of young people from different cultural communities. Will this be an opportunity for us to build a more open and successful society, including the many faces of life that form our community today? As the planes bring the athletes into London, will we still have aeroplanes taking asylum seekers and refugees out of London? I had my attention drawn to a person who had been working in Newham for 10 years but who, last week, was sent home. These issues have to be joined up and connected.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07030136000143"></a>Will the Games have a ring of steel around them, in which case the community in which they are set will not be engaged, or will there be real opportunities, by us all working together through volunteering and employment, to draw a whole generation into the excitement of this experience?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07030136000144"></a>If you go into east London today, you cannot avoid the reality that religious faith is important for people. It is important that the legacy of the Games also takes account of those issues in their lives for the future. Will we have a serious conversation, not just with the churches but with the other faith communities, about the needs of those communities for the future? I was told, recognising the size of the south-east of England, that nearly two-thirds of young people who are active members of churches in England are inside the ring of the M25 and that a very high proportion of them go to predominantly black-led churches. How are their needs, as they see them, to be met in the structuring of the legacy? Are we thinking about those sorts of facilities?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07030136000145"></a>I want to talk about housing. I understand that people are already buying up properties in east London and that the affordability of housing is becoming an issue. I am told that people in Asia and across the world are buying properties with a view to the Games. What are the proportions of the affordable housing that will be part of the legacy? I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, said about the London Docklands Development Corporation. I am sure that we all endorse the need for a clear structure, but one outcome that we do not want in east London is the gentrification of Tower Hamlets and Newham whereby the poor of those communities disappear into Barking, Dagenham and Thurrock. With the mobility of people, there are now 11 BNP councillors in Barking and Dagenham. We must watch that in the end we do not say how wonderful things are in the immediate communities when all we that have done is shift the problems elsewhere; we gentrify the riverbank and a few hundred yards back, moving the poor elsewhere. That will not do. We must think about the social issues and make sure that the benefits of the legacy go to the people who host the Games. These are complex social, spiritual and cultural issues, but they are terribly important because if we get the legacy right we shall have done something for the well-being of the whole of our country.</p>

<a name="07030136000146"></a><b><a name="70301-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07030136000344"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, on raising our sights beyond the topic of the moment and encouraging us to look at the value of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. When I started to make notes for this debate, I found that it was impossible not to mention the chimera of a budget. It is beginning to be quite difficult. I do not want to skimp&#151;to use my noble friend&#146;s phrase&#151;and I know that the bid document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07030136000256"></a>&#147;We are only building new venues where clear legacy needs have been identified and supporting business plans developed for post-Games use&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000242"></a>However, it is beginning to be quite difficult not to think about taking a hard look at the number and scale of the venues and the existing facilities that London and the UK have to offer. My other reason for being unable to resist the temptation of mentioning the budget is that, like the Mayor of London, I do not believe that any contractor could look at a 60 per cent contingency and not be tempted to regard that as part of his base budget.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07030136000147"></a>My main point about the budget is that what is happening does nothing but feed opposition to the Games. Some of that opposition comes in the guise of conditional support, which is really opposition waiting to break out in public. A huge benefit of the Games should be to draw people together in their enthusiasm for them. The more that confidence in the enterprise as a whole ebbs away, the more damage is done. I do not know whether the figure in the bid book should have been &#163;3 billion, &#163;4.5 billion or &#163;5 billion instead of &#163;2.375 billion; if it had been one of those, a higher figure might well have been broadly accepted, but the rumours and the time that is elapsing mean that support is leeching away. When we get to the budget, we must have enough detail to be able to analyse it, the variations from the original figure and the subsequent changes after it is published, because I do not think that it will remain a static figure. We must not hide behind commercial confidentiality and keep from the public what these Games are really costing because, as the noble Baroness reminded us at the start, there is immense value, not all of which one can put a cash figure on.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07030136000148"></a>The budget itself is a legacy issue, given that the money will have to come from somewhere: indeed, &#163;340 million has already been diverted from community sport, and the Secretary of State says that more is to be taken. How do we contribute to the sporting legacy? No wonder that the charitable and voluntary sectors are so concerned about the position of the lottery. Those sectors will, in different ways, be contributing to achieving many of the potential legacy aims.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07030136000149"></a>Like my noble friend, I am a Mancunian, and I am proud of what Manchester did with the Commonwealth Games, even if my team does not seem to be as inspired as it should be by its new stadium. I am now&#151;I am not sure whether this is an &#147;and&#148; or an &#147;or&#148;&#151;a Londoner. One of the legacies that I very much do not want is the feeling that affluent London is getting it all. As we have just been reminded so powerfully, &#147;affluent&#148; does not apply to the area of London where many of the events will take place. The  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1659"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1659</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legacy should not have a geographical limit; it should not be confined to, or within, London. I am surprised that we have so far not heard speeches about the need to show legacy benefit right across the UK. Indeed, I thought that we might have a Welsh speaker today. As the noble Baroness has said, we need to acknowledge the regeneration in its broadest sense, particularly the transport developments, which would never have been achieved without the bid for the Games being won.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07030136000150"></a>I particularly want to mention the Paralympics, the legacy of which is to,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000260"></a>&#147;motivate greater numbers of young people&#151;and in particular those with disabilities&#151;to become involved with sport, and to aspire to elite performance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000243"></a>The LOCOG budget has &#163;90 million for the Paralympic Games and I understand that half of this comes from the public sector funding package. There are no established pathways for disabled people to get into sport and no pathways for training non-elite athletes and coaches. Not very long ago, the London Assembly, of which I am a member, looked at sport for disabled people in the context of the bid having been won. We heard from those working in the area that, although there has been some discussion of legacy funding, there are no financial or timescale commitments and no indication of what will go towards disabled sports. There has been no increase in funding for community sports since we won the bid; indeed, as I said, some money is being redirected. I ask this not to carp but because I hope that there is a positive answer: how can the Paralympic sport legacy, any more than the whole Olympic sport legacy, happen without more funding for community sport?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07030136000151"></a>Just talking about the value of the Paralympic Games will not magically create a change in attitude or participation. Someone needs to drive this forward. As part of the investigation by the London Assembly, I visited a sports club in Camberwell. The visit was at once inspiring and disheartening. It was inspiring because we visited a class of very disabled children, run by an absolutely terrific coach, where there was one-to-one assistance from trainers; one could see from the attitude of the children who attended and from talking to their parents who were with them what value this gave to their lives. However, between the time of our visit and the time we launched the report, which was only two or three months later, the club had to cut its classes to one a week. There had been only two, but this was cut to one. Fifty-thousand pounds a year&#151;peanuts for this budget&#151;would make an enormous difference to that club, and there must be many like it.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07030136000152"></a>Access to sport for children with special needs is horribly neglected. They are often sidelined from sports provision in mainstream schools. Lack of transport is a barrier; teachers are not properly equipped and they barely get any training. The London Games provide the impetus for change and we should honour the promises that we made in London&#146;s bid. We should also stick to our promises to another group. The noble Baroness has talked about skills and training. The group that I am talking about so badly lacks jobs skills. It is only too easy not to make the effort to reach the very hardest to reach: those deprived personally and those in deprived communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07030136000153"></a>To end more positively, I shall quote the leaders of two of the so-called Olympic boroughs at a meeting of the London Assembly. One said,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000261"></a>&#147;we are using the whole carnival, celebration and excitement ... as a catalyst to re-ignite passion within our communities and serious engagement with our communities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000244"></a>Another said,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000262"></a>&#147;we want to use the Games to enhance community cohesion&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000245"></a>Her borough, Tower Hamlets,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000263"></a>&#147;is rolling out, through the local strategic partnership, the coming together of communities to bring forward their ideas and how they want to see the Olympics affecting our borough&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000246"></a>She reminded us that 42 per cent of children are in poverty in the borough, in which the average salary, because of Canary Wharf, is &#163;100,000 a year.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07030136000154"></a>The great thing about winning the bid was the can-do approach that it encapsulated. It is now essential to maintain people&#146;s confidence and show that we can do it, and do it well.</p>

As has been said, there is some controversy and public concern about the cost of the Olympics and the Paralympics, and rightly so: it obviously needs to be gripped and dealt with, lessons need to be learnt, as has been said, and public confidence needs to be maintained in this whole enterprise. I guess that we could probably all predict some of the other storms that we will see and hear about over the next five years, although I shall not tempt fate by doing so. Some of them will need real attention, but none of them should blow the Olympics off course or lead to short-term and short-sighted reactions.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07030136000156"></a>That is why the noble Baroness&#146;s debate about the long term and the legacy is so important. All her arguments about how the legacy needs to be planned for and managed are powerful. It will not simply happen; someone needs to be responsible for it and for each part of it. We need to be clear about what sort of legacy we want and, as important, about what the measures of success will be. These measures need to be about outcomes and not only about processes. They need to be things that we can point to and identify as lasting, beneficial results&#151;the legacy, if you like.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07030136000157"></a>All that implies a significant role for leadership and management, but this is not only about robust planning and management or governance and government. If the Olympics and Paralympics are about anything, they are about inspiration, effort, achievement and ambition. They are about individuals and teams. They play to our aspirations. I suspect that one of the most lasting legacies will be in what thousands of people actually do and actually feel. It is not only about authority planners and government; it could be about us all. It certainly sets challenges for very many people such as architects, designers, teachers, health workers, sports people, and public and private organisations.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07030136000158"></a>In this context, I was very impressed by the energy of the bid and by the images and portrayal of London and its citizens. There was a real sense of momentum,  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1661"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of unity of purpose and of community built from diversity. It was very inclusive; I was struck by the words of the right reverend Prelate on this. This was impressive and it bodes well for the future if it can be maintained.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07030136000159"></a>When, on 1 March 2013 in this Chamber, the noble Baroness asks whether we are satisfied with the emerging legacy, I hope that we will have a great deal to say and that, although not all of it is likely to be positive, much of it will be. Most important, I hope that we do not conclude that it all went pretty well but that it was a great missed opportunity.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07030136000160"></a>Let me turn to that legacy. I declare an interest as the former NHS Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary for Health, so your Lordships will not be surprised to know that my comments will concentrate on health. There is, I know, an awful lot of planning under way from the NHS and the department with its partners. Excellent work is being done with Sport England, with its great campaign for sport and exercise, making sure that we all understand the link between exercise and health and that exercise is as widespread as possible. Good work has already been started on sports medicine, as was raised in a recent Question in this House. I also want to mention the Paralympics in this context. What boost will we see for sport and activity for disabled people as a result of the Paralympics? I very much identified with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on this. But what, for the Paralympics, will be the wider impacts and who is responsible for securing them?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07030136000161"></a>Let me draw out one aspect that can often be overlooked in this context; namely, the link between mental health and physical activity. Evidence shows that physical activity is the second most important thing for people&#146;s mental well-being&#151;the first, incidentally, is having somebody whom you can confide in and trust. I guess that that is not surprising&#151;we all know it&#151;but it is another important point about the legacy of these Olympics and Paralympics. We need to make sure that it reaches everyone. That can be very difficult; it can be pretty difficult for us all to get to the gym or whatever is our intended method of getting some exercise, but persuading people who are not feeling very good about themselves to do it may be even harder.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07030136000162"></a>Let me talk about east London. As has been said, the Games are taking place in the poorest part of London with the worst health facilities and the worst health&#151;although east London has some wonderful beacons of excellence. It is said, and I believe it to be accurate, that as you go east, for every tube stop life expectancy drops a year. Presumably that stops being the case at some point. However, it is a real point about the area in which this enterprise is taking place. I note from Sport England&#146;s recent study that the people of Newham are the least physically active in the city; it is perhaps not surprising that sports activity is often associated with affluence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07030136000163"></a>Sheila Adam, the director of public health for London, reminded me that one reason why many health people signed up to the bid was that the Games would take place in east London, not west London,  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1662"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that we saw the opportunity for enormous health benefits from that. What is likely to be left behind in health terms in east London? I know that some health facilities are being planned for the Olympics. It is important that these are secured for the longer term and that we understand that these are community and primary care facilities and not hospitals. The thing that is greatly lacking is services that are available immediately to people in the community. We need to be reassured that these facilities, which will be created for the great influx of people over this period, will then be turned over to local people for their use.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07030136000164"></a>Mental and physical health is determined by things other than the NHS, such as community facilities. However, there is no use in sport if there is no access and I hear rumblings that some facilities may not be available in the longer term. We need to be reassured about that. But this is also about transport and infrastructure and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, said, regeneration. Poverty and ill health go hand in hand, as do ill health and worklessness. The economy and health go hand in hand; good health can benefit the economy and a healthy economy boosts health. When I asked other health planners what was most important in this legacy, high on their list was employment, which of course helps to pull people out of poverty. They went on to mention employment in the construction period, not just for outsiders but for local people and local organisations, and the need for longer-term investment, as the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, and others have said. It will be interesting to know what local people with all their diversity of culture and background will say about the legacy. Will they feel part of it? Will they feel more connected to affluent Britain? Without the gentrification, will this be a place where people choose to live?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07030136000165"></a>I have talked about the things on which the Government need to take the lead in securing, although they will depend on the enormous creativity and energy of all those involved locally. But on the aspirational, what new standards will be set? What records will be broken off the track or sports field or out of the pool? What is the opportunity for people to be challenged and inspired in every field? Let me conclude with three quick examples, two of them not from health.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07030136000166"></a>The first one relates to sustainability and sustainable building. I was talking to some architects recently about the challenging sustainability targets that are already in place in London. They were saying, &#147;Why not raise the bar even higher with the Olympics? Why are we not showing a generation what can be done and what the aspiration for the future should be?&#148; The second is another topic that we have not talked about&#151;security, that growing industry that intrudes on us all. How will that be achieved in a safe and friendly but non-constraining way? How will it be managed in the midst of a lively community? There are standards to be set there.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07030136000167"></a>Finally, I turn to research. The biggest problem in health today is keeping people healthy. As I have said in the House before, that is about early health, not late disease. We know a lot about late disease&#151;we know the biomedicine and the research&#151;but there is  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1663"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not yet very good research on maintaining health. This is an opportunity to have a laboratory in the UK, perhaps in the East End, to understand the issues and learn some of the lessons.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07030136000168"></a>I hope that the illustrations that I have used are useful. My contribution can be summed up simply: plan systematically for the legacy, play to the aspirations and imagination of us all and challenge people to set new standards in every field.</p>

I also agree with my noble friend Lord Lee&#146;s thoughts about the budget, not least in respect of museums and galleries. Having queued like an eager schoolboy yesterday at the tremendous exhibition organised by the northern museums and galleries to hold the football which was used in the 1966 World Cup final and have my photo taken&#151;I am sorry if noble Lords missed that chance because I think it has gone back to Preston&#151;I know how important even that kind of legacy can be in terms of driving both aspiration and economic development.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07030136000170"></a>However, in my view the cost of putting on the Games can only be justified if they produce a legacy which goes well beyond the immediate impact of the Games themselves. I think it is pretty clear that there will be a substantial positive legacy in the Lower Lea Valley and surrounding areas. There is clearly going to be significant physical regeneration, which is extremely welcome. However, I do not believe that the cost of putting on the Games could be justified if the only beneficiaries were going to be the communities in east London contiguous to the Olympic park. For me, the real success of the Games will be measured by the extent to which it has been possible to use them as a catalyst to longer-term changes in economic and social behaviour. This is a lot to ask but I do not believe it is impossible because of the power of the Games&#146; brand and the extraordinary power of sport to motivate people to behave in ways which society believes to be positive.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07030136000171"></a>What would then constitute a successful legacy? In the time I have today, I would like to concentrate on the social component because I believe we should be looking to the Games to enable us to effect a stepped improvement in health, fitness and educational levels across the whole of the UK and not just London. If we are to achieve this, we will need to be more successful than any Olympics or any other international sporting event to date. I believe it is possible, first, because we are debating this a long time before the Olympics happen so there is time to get things right, and, secondly, because there are examples elsewhere in the world and in the UK where good practice has developed around big sporting events. I would like to mention three of them and in doing so I declare an interest because I have acted as an adviser to all three.</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07030136000172"></a>First, as a result of the failed bid to host the 2006 football World Cup in England, an initiative was launched between the Prince&#146;s Trust and the FA Premier  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1664"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1664</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>League, the PFA and the Football Foundation to link the work of the trust&#146;s programmes for unemployed and disadvantaged young people with professional football clubs. This year, 10 years on, 12,000 unemployed young people will have participated in this programme and more than 80 per cent of them will have gone on to get a job or have gone into further education and training. None of that would have happened without a bid, which in the end was unsuccessful. How much better could we do on the back of a successful bid?</p>

<a name="70301-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07030136000173"></a>Secondly, I am involved in a programme which has just begun at the North-West University&#146;s Mafikeng campus in South Africa. It gives poor students a university education which they would otherwise have been unable to afford&#151;because they have an ability in football. That is possible because the 2010 World Cup is going to South Africa and funding partners are willing to get involved in sport and community development, which, frankly, would not have been forthcoming without the impetus of that great sporting event.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07030136000174"></a>Thirdly, to take a programme which should benefit a whole nation&#151;albeit a small one&#151;the cricket World Cup in Barbados is being used by the Government and people of Barbados to put in place a seven-strand legacy programme for economic, environmental, sport and social development. I am involved in the strand which aims to put in place a programme for young people to combine sport, mainstream education and lifestyle training, covering among other things nutrition and sexual health. All these things are already being addressed in Barbados to a greater or lesser extent, but the cricket World Cup has given it the chance to take provision to a higher level and to tap into new sources of funds to do so. There is no reason why we should not seek to follow that precedent.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07030136000175"></a>Having been involved in these programmes, what conclusions do I draw about what we need to do to maximise the social and economic benefits for the UK? First, we need to set clear targets, which should include increasing participation in sport and physical activity. There should be particular efforts at school level, but equally we need to get much better at encouraging young people when they leave school to keep active and to remain so throughout their lives. To do that, we need to look well beyond the Olympic disciplines. Speaking for myself, I have to accept that I will never be a triathlete, a pole-vaulter or a sprinter. Fortunately, there are less demanding forms of activity which I can and, I hope, will pursue to keep myself fit. We need to do more to provide facilities and encouragement for people like me.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07030136000176"></a>We should use the Olympics to improve the nation&#146;s diet. It is blindingly obvious that no athlete could compete successfully if he or she ate unhealthily, drank like a fish or smoked like a chimney. There is great scope to encourage children to eat more healthily if they understand that Olympians follow a healthy diet, but we need more to make that link. Incidentally, we are not just talking about obesity. I gather that about 1 million people suffer from other eating disorders, principally anorexia and bulimia, of which 80 per cent  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1665"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are teenage girls. We ought to think about how we can use Olympic models, rather than catwalk models, to be role models to that group.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07030136000177"></a>We should use the Olympics to improve basic education by learning from the experience of professional football and cricket clubs which have sports-related curriculum material delivered at the grounds and more widely through the Playing for Success programme. The Olympics offer endless opportunities for coursework in maths, English, languages, geography and history, which we should develop. Finally, we should use the Olympics to teach the Olympic virtues of sportsmanship, tolerance, fair play and international goodwill. At a recent conference in London, I was intrigued to hear a leading Chinese Olympic official describe how Olympic values were being taught in all Chinese schools in the run-up to the 2008 Games. It seems to me that to include and induce these values into a generation of young Chinese would be doing the world a very great favour, and we should do likewise.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07030136000178"></a>Having set such targets, how are we to achieve them? First, we need simple, clear structures to deliver them. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, talked about structures in the East End for physical regeneration in the longer term, but we need equivalents to deal with these social issues. I am not suggesting a huge parallel bureaucracy of what already exists, but at a national level at least there needs to be a clear co-ordination of effort, which can be filtered through, in many cases, existing local structures.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07030136000179"></a>Secondly, there needs to be more resources, as always. The only country which has taken sporting and physical activity rates up to the level set by our Government for Sport England is Finland, where they spend more than twice as much per head than us. I do not believe that we should look for new money: a lot of money is spent&#151;not necessarily always very well&#151;on improving healthy lifestyles and education, which could be diverted into these areas.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07030136000180"></a>Thirdly, we need leadership. The rhetoric from Ministers and others so far has been excellent, but we need an ongoing political will to continue getting across the potential of the Games, as well as getting the delivery right. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, suggested that we need a Cabinet Minister. I am not sure about that, but I certainly support the idea of a Minister for the Olympics. The CCPR in its briefing for today points out that there is a tendency for major events to have a long sunrise and a short sunset. We need to get cracking now to exploit the sunrise and to allow us to prolong the sunset.</p>

I declare an interest as someone who works extensively across the arts and heritage sector, and I must say that I am somewhat surprised that so far there has not been very great mention of the role that culture can and will play in the Olympics and the Paralympics. I also declare an interest as a member of the Olympic Culture and Education Committee, which was involved in putting  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1666"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1666</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together the cultural aspects of the bid. The focus of this debate is the socio-economic benefits of the Olympics. I have observed that the contribution that the cultural programme could make in this respect has not been discussed to a great extent anywhere, so I want to foreground that.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07030136000182"></a>In the context of ever-rising costs of the building project, as noble Lords have said, it is important to reassure the public that this expenditure is an investment in the region and the country as a whole. Besides the tangible infrastructure&#151;already mentioned&#151;such as the stadium, improved transport, the media centre, accommodation and the boost to local economies through tourism, et cetera, there will also be the impact on our sense of ourselves as a nation in terms of our ability to deliver one of the most complex and prestigious global projects and to share with 200 other nations our cultural riches.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07030136000183"></a>In our bid document, we expressed three key objectives for the arts, culture and education programme for 2012; namely, to provide a dazzling and spectacular ceremonial programme which is creatively and impeccably staged; to unlock Britain&#146;s creative wealth and London&#146;s reputation as a world cultural capital to celebrate youth and internationalism; and to instil the Olympic spirit through inspiring education. We recognised the importance of addressing the desire of the founder of the modern Olympic movement, Pierre de Coubertin&#151;the creation of a partnership between sport, culture and education. If we go back to de Coubertin's vision, we see that he intended the creation of an environment where the highest achievements of the human body and the human intellectual and creative force could meet in the spirit of mutual inspiration. We very much want to build on this vision. This is a huge challenge, especially as we now have a commitment to staging a cultural programme that lasts for the four years between Beijing 2008 and London 2012.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07030136000184"></a>Now an integral part of the Olympic programme, other host cities have recognised the social and regeneration benefits of staging a sustained, strategic cultural programme. The principal reasons for doing so might be summarised as, first, acknowledgement of the cultural and creative capacity of the host city; secondly, improvement of the quality and reach of cultural services; thirdly, providing a showcase for the country&#146;s cultural and creative diversity for internal consumption; fourthly, projection of the city and the country globally; and, fifthly, changing its image.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07030136000185"></a>London, of course, has a good head start in many of these areas, but we should acknowledge that, although in many respects we have an enviable reputation for supporting arts and culture through public subsidy, we cannot afford to be complacent. I was particularly struck by that in relation to our discussion in Question Time about the precarious nature of some of our local provision.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07030136000186"></a>There are some bright spots; first, the unprecedented co-operation between the five London Olympic boroughs is an excellent sign of the benefits of collaboration across boundaries to secure a much-enhanced cultural provision for all. The cultural sector has already made a substantial contribution to improving the quality of life, sense of local pride and self-esteem across the country. The sector has worked hard to develop and  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1667"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1667</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>resource diverse communities, including people with disabilities. We should remember that, as one of your Lordships has pointed out, Britain initiated the Paralympics&#151;a tradition on which I hope we will build in both the cultural and sporting festivals.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07030136000187"></a>When allied strategically with regeneration programmes, the achievements have been notable in both urban and rural areas. Cumbria, Newcastle and Walsall particularly spring to mind; in the Olympics and Paralympics context, as others of your Lordships have already mentioned, Manchester is a good example of how culture and sport work so well together. The investment in Barcelona&#146;s cultural infrastructure was also important in its rising popularity as a European destination. I would like to know: are there any cultural facilities that we hope will emerge in east London as a result of the Olympics and the Paralympics?</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07030136000188"></a>Culture is obviously a huge draw for people coming to London, and this attraction can be used to encourage visitors to travel beyond the capital. I know that Yorkshire, for example, is keen to maximise the benefits of cultural tourism in its regional development plans for the Olympics. One hopes that there are co-ordinated strategic plans for delivery on that objective across the country. China&#146;s parting message at the end of the 2008 Olympics will be &#147;Sail Onwards in Hope&#148;. We hope that that will be taken up by our FriendShip project, a centrepiece of the cultural proposals for 2012. Through working on themes of exchange, voyage and exploration, the challenges of national and global citizenship can be examined, with the aim of helping young and older people to develop an understanding of what it means to be a modern Briton in our contemporary world.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07030136000189"></a>The provision for young people is clearly important and the keystone of the cultural programme. We have been shamed by the recent report on the psychological and physical environment in which we bring up our children. Within many parts of the cultural sector, there has long been a recognition that young people have not been well served in our society. Although we alone cannot solve these problems, we certainly can, will and have been initiating and participating in cultural projects by working across a number of sectors and professions, including health, mental health and the environment. We can continue to work on such projects, which can at least in some way contribute toward improving the lives of our young people.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07030136000190"></a>The Olympic cultural festival can also contribute to the legacy of the Games through opening and sustaining dialogues with the many nations that will be represented through the sporting events. Cultural diplomacy has significant potential as a positive force, and it stands the best chance of being effective if a wide, diverse range of actors across services, professions and sectors&#151;and the cultural sector&#151;are involved in negotiating the process, shape and delivery of the programme and a vital cultural legacy.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07030136000191"></a>With constant reports of budget over-runs, I would like the Minister to reassure the House that the already slim resources allocated to the cultural programme are not to be clawed back. The sum involved is so tiny in comparison to the overall budget that any such act would merely be a gesture, but I know that the cultural sector are nervous about that.</p>

I declare an interest as a board member of the Olympic Delivery Authority.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07030136000194"></a>Strong partnerships and the sort of working relationships to which the noble Baroness referred are key to delivering both a successful Games and, perhaps more importantly, the legacy that London and the whole of the UK want. Those are between LOCOG and the ODA, between Government and the GLA, between boroughs, business and the London Development Agency, and so many others. The expectations are high, as we have indeed heard today, but not as big as the challenge. I confess to feeling very shell-shocked the first time that I went around the site itself, on a bus tour organised for new board members. The sheer enormity of the task in the site itself is huge, before we even talk about the wider legacies in the communities and country beyond. We should never underestimate the size of the task ahead. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07030136000195"></a>Like others, I do not intend to dwell on the budget or to continue building a sense of what is, in my view, a false crisis about it. Personally, I agree with the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on the contingency funds and I hope that a realistic level is agreed there.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07030136000196"></a>The Games are an absolutely massive challenge. To put it in context, the project is twice the size of T5 but has to be built in half the time. It is a fantastic opportunity. This is not just about creating the stage for what will be the greatest sporting spectacle that the country has ever seen&#151;if we get it right&#151;and making the most that we can of the opportunity. It is about regenerating one of the poorest parts of London and bringing a range of benefits across the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07030136000197"></a>I have a few indices about the local community; many of your Lordships have already referred to these today. We know that of the 354 local authority areas in the UK, three of the five host boroughs are the fourth, fifth and 11th most deprived. The remaining two are in the top 50. Life expectancy in Newham is the lowest of all London boroughs&#151;six years lower for men and five years lower for women than Westminster, which has the highest. We heard earlier about tube stations; it is actually from Bank to Stratford via the Central line that each tube stop represents a one-year decrease in life expectancy. A majority of children live in poverty in 23 out of the24 wards, and unemployment runs at 35 per cent on several estates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07030136000199"></a>There are two crucial elements in the DNA of everybody involved in this project. First, Games and legacy planning are truly integrated for the first time in Olympic history. Secondly, the planning for the Games through LOCOG and via the Olympic Delivery Authority is fully integrated, and they are working strongly together. As many Members of the House will be aware, that partnership is crucial to the delivery of the Games and their legacy&#151;and has been criticised in previous Games in other cities.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07030136000200"></a>A culture of &#147;no white elephants&#148; is running through the ODA. There will only be permanent facilities if there is a long-term legacy-use post the Games. There is no point staging brilliant Games and then suffering a sort of national hangover, with the venues gathering dust two years afterwards. As we want this project to be the catalyst for lasting social change, it is absolutely essential to get that right. We are talking about staging the greatest sporting event on Earth, but also about delivering the largest regeneration project in Europe.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07030136000201"></a>How is this task being done? Planning is absolutely key, as many noble Lords have said today. If we plan for Games and legacy together, we have a chance truly to achieve the objectives that we have set. Equally, if we plan and then make decisions, we must stick to them. Projects run into trouble when the scope is changed half way through. I thought it might be useful to give some examples of how, by working together, we are planning to help deliver the legacy that everyone wants. The partnerships are multi-faceted and wider than that of LOCOG and the London Development Agency.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07030136000202"></a>I shall give some tangible examples. The 70,000 volunteers that LOCOG requires link the pre-volunteer programme that the LDA is running to address worklessness in London into planning for the Games themselves. Similarly, combined work by the GLA and the London Development Agency on skills links into the employment opportunities that the ODA and LOCOG provide. Within the Olympic Park, the ODA is delivering the international broadcast centre and media press centre for the Games; that will then become part of Hackney&#146;s legacy ambition, by converting these facilities into industrial space afterwards. Likewise, the ODA&#146;s current procurement needs&#151;and, later, those of LOCOG&#151;link to the ambitions and work of the LDA, which is creating the London business network to help London businesses get the most from the Games, as well as skilling-up to exploit wider business opportunities.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07030136000203"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, said most acutely, it is crucial to put aside both old vested interests and silos. This will work only if people work together in a way which we know at times has not happened. Most crucially, we have to ensure that local people, especially the Bangladeshi communities, benefit from the opportunities that will come forward in the next few years.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07030136000204"></a>One of the most difficult parts of the delivery of the Games and the legacy is meeting the very high expectations there are&#151;whether with regard to skills, sustainability, diversity, sports participation or arts and culture. Of course, there is also the overall economic and physical regeneration. Somehow we have to value and harness that enthusiasm but, above all, we must have a very tough, focused delivery programme, or none of this will be met. I hate to sound boring, practical and pragmatic, but that is where the work has to start.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07030136000205"></a>In broad terms, the delivery programme involves two years of acquiring the land, securing the necessary planning permissions and doing the venue and infrastructure design. That is well on the way. There are then four years of cleaning up the land platform, constructing the venues and the infrastructure and one year for test events. It is clear that the Games experience is significantly enhanced if the venues have been tested and volunteer programmes properly prepared.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07030136000206"></a>So far the ODA has finalised the master plan. It is over six years out, has given clarity and certainty, has saved jobs, and has ensured that there will be more sustainable venues post-Games. The programme timetable has been finalised and the planning applications have been submitted&#151;which did not really fit into the overall sustainability and environmental aims of the Games, because it meant truckloads of paper were submitted. But they were submitted on time and that is going through. The process of undergrounding the pylons has been started and we have started to see the transport improvements come on stream. The delivery partner has also been appointed and a very far-reaching sustainability report is being published, too. It is early days, but a strong start has been made. The major milestones have been hit and the challenge will be doing that week in and week out for the next 2,000 days.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07030136000207"></a>The level of enthusiasm remains very high. Of course, there are difficulties and there will be more, but local communities are very clear about the benefits. Earlier on I was looking at a letter received from the mayor&#146;s office in Hackney, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07030136000257"></a>&#147;For the last seven years Hackney has consistently recognised the opportunities that a bid to host the London Games and hosting the Games themselves, can bring to a community and how it can act as a catalyst at each stage of the process, to accelerate the delivery of a range of long held Borough aspirations as well as using the momentum of an Olympic project to bring forward new ideas and new relationships&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000247"></a>The mayor then goes through a range of opportunities that he sees being delivered in Hackney. These include dealing with,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000264"></a>&#147;worklessness, training and employment opportunities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000248"></a>physical regeneration, transport opportunities, and volunteering. The letter says that Hackney sees,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000265"></a>&#147;the Olympic Park as the catalyst in bringing a revitalised environmental and sporting focus to&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000249"></a>that part of east London. It is also an opportunity to raise the level of participation in sports and arts to a level that has never been met. So there is a high level of enthusiasm in Hackney and all the other boroughs, which at the moment is still building on the bid process. It would be very unfortunate if a level of  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1671"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1671</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cynicism crept in at a national level that then fed down into those local boroughs&#151;because at the moment that cynicism is not there.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07030136000208"></a>Expectations and enthusiasm remain high; the plans are sound, but very challenging. The task of this great project is for me not only the Games, huge though that is, but how the local community is transformed after 2012. Clearly as a House we should return to this subject many times. I am confident that if we work together across the bodies to which we have referred today and the political divides, we can meet these tasks, pass these tests and leave a great legacy for the whole country.</p>

That is not the subject before your Lordships' House today, but I shall make one comment in passing. Whatever the eventual cost outturn, the Government and this nation must demand excellence in quality and demonstrable value, and ensure that it is delivered.</p>

<a name="70301-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07030136000210"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, and other noble Lords, have great experience and knowledge of the activities in Greater London, and she expressed concern that we should ensure an economic and social legacy for future generations. I was personally much moved by the contribution of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford and his remarks on the social consequences. It is something that we need to take into consideration in our House.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07030136000211"></a>I should like to spend a few minutes on parts of the legacy envisaged for the devolved Administrations, the nine English regions in general and Wales in particular, on this glorious St David&#146;s Day&#151;although it will disappoint the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that someone is here to talk about it. I remind your Lordships that outside the core athletic activities there is also a cultural Olympiad, which commences at the closing ceremony in August 2008 in Beijing. It is interesting to note that in the history of the modern Olympiad up till 1948, which was the last time when the Games were staged in London, Olympic medals were awarded for sculpture, music, literature and art. This cultural Olympiad will extend for four years.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07030136000212"></a>For successful delivery of the vision of London's bid, it is vital that the core aims of celebration, welcoming the world to our shores and the involvement and inspiration of young people are centre stage. It is understood that no specific funding will be available for the cultural Olympiad and that a large part of the programme will probably be delivered by existing organisations and networks. Some funds may be made available through the Legacy Trust UK, which will be established next year, and could be funded to the tune of &#163;40 million, including &#163;34 million from the National Lottery and &#163;6 million from the Exchequer. That is to be spent over the years up to and including 2012. However, I trust that the Government will heed the words of deep concern expressed by Sir Clive Booth in  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1672"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1672</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>connection with the apparent plundering of the Big Lottery Fund referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07030136000213"></a>It is essential that nationwide activities are complementary and co-ordinated through the mechanism of the Nations and Regions Group. In Wales the culture group is discussing numerous options, which include securing a short but high-level Welsh presence in the UK&#146;s presentation at the Beijing closing ceremony; seeking to establish an Olympic link to the Artes Mundi festival in 2012; the creating of an opening ceremony for the Olympic football tournament group which is to be staged in Cardiff at the Millennium stadium; featuring the Olympic theme in the Urdd, National and Llangollen International Eisteddfodau; establishing an international arts festival by 2009 to provide an opportunity of leverage for that part of the 2009 Ashes series taking part in south Wales and the all-important Ryder Cup in 2010; and offering, through LOCOG, the opportunity to host an Olympic youth camp in Wales.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07030136000214"></a>As noble Lords can see, the menu is extensive, and I am sure that similar thinking and activity is gathering momentum through other English regions and devolved Administrations. However, there lurks a cynicism about LOCOG's ability to ensure that the cultural Olympiad is not simply a London programme and whether there will eventually be an ability to maintain a commitment to the programme when resources are inevitably drained as pressures escalate. As the cultural programme in Great Britain will rely on a prosperous arts landscape, any cuts in this sector&#146;s funding over the next four years must significantly reduce the ability of that sector to deliver a unique and outstanding cultural Olympiad.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07030136000215"></a>In respect of the core sporting activities and related programmes, it is encouraging to know that the majority of structures being created in the London area will have sustainable use. As important for the legacy, if not more so, are the softer priorities such as tourism, skills and education, volunteering and sports development for young people. Businesses will need to respond and to develop proactively&#151;to develop, adapt and innovate&#151;to meet the opportunity that the event will present. It is important, specifically, that procurement skills be addressed as a matter of priority. Nationally, SMEs must be encouraged and actively supported through existing mechanisms to up their game and be proactive in getting involved in the tendering process. There are, and will be, significant opportunities for tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07030136000216"></a>Volunteering was recognised as one of the most successful aspects of the 2000 Sydney Games; volunteers gave a warm welcome, displaying good cheer and impressive language skills. In the immediate term, development of a pre-volunteer programme&#151;a concept successfully used in the Manchester Commonwealth Games 2002&#151;could be pursued. It consisted of basic-level skills training, targeted at people in communities with high levels of unemployment or economic inactivity. It is also important to take advantage of the interest that has already been stated by the people in this country to ensure the broadest participation.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1673"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1673</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07030136000217"></a>It is predicted that tourism will be boosted by some &#163;2 billion, some 40 per cent of which could well go outside London. This is supported by experiences in Barcelona and Sydney. Again, that will happen only if the regions of the devolved Administrations grasp the opportunity now.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07030136000218"></a>My consistent view is that nothing will come to the regions or to the devolved Administrations unless there is substantial proactivity. An official of the 1992 Barcelona Games organising committee recently said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07030136000258"></a>&#147;I recommend that the lesson for Wales is that you should be proactive, autonomous and as quick to take advantage of opportunities as possible and not simply ask others for resources and for help. It is necessary to establish a realistic and early commitment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000250"></a>Another person said that Barcelona was neglected for most of the 20th century and had the chance to invest in six years what would otherwise have taken 50 years to achieve.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07030136000219"></a>Finally, I quote, with permission, from the former premier of New South Wales, the honourable Bob Carr, whom I recently consulted. He is a good friend of Britain and of old Wales. A few weeks after the Games in September 2000 had ended, he wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07030136000259"></a>&#147;It was a new age for Australia, a new way of looking at ourselves and celebrating our unique, diverse, enriching, common purpose. We were, I felt, the happiest people in the world&#146;s most favoured nation at the best time in our history&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030136000251"></a>Let us see if we can do the same.</p>

Although everybody thinks that the Olympics are a wonderful opportunity&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, must be congratulated on giving us the chance to say it&#151;there are pitfalls of expectation surrounding the event. Only my noble friends have actually said this, so let us get it out of the way. Unless there is a degree of coherence about the budget, which requires the involvement of everybody in government, in both Westminster and Whitehall, we could be hanging an albatross around the neck of the Games. We have to be coherent, because if everything is going well, the press have nothing to write about. We have to tell the truth and push it out properly; we must let people know exactly what is going on.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07030136000221"></a>My noble friend Lady Hamwee, not for the first time, encapsulated the argument within government. With a 60 per cent contingency, any contractor worth his salt will say, &#147;I&#146;ll have some of that, if not all of it&#148;. We would all do it if we knew that that budget was available&#151;at least we would try. So we must get some clarity.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07030136000222"></a>When the announcement was made, it was a moment of pure joy that will stay with me for a long time. Even at my advancing age, I jumped in the air, punched the ceiling and cried &#147;Yes!&#148;. True, I wish it had been a few years earlier so that when I landed, my knees did not creak, but the feeling of enthusiasm that only sport can bring was there. Only in sport is that idea of being all together and the exultation in someone else&#146;s effort and triumph.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1674"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07030136000223"></a>We really must support this. That is why it is worth having these arguments and making sure we establish a degree of coherence. If we do not, we will not get there. We must encourage people to get involved. The social benefit that will result and of people being enthusiastic about sport is a huge, positive thing. It gives us a sense of identity and brings us together. That happens in all sports. Not only are we taking part in this, we are creating it. That is a benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07030136000224"></a>Let me give some free advice which can be cheaply ignored. If the Prime Minister wants a legacy, let him look to the Olympics. A successful Olympics will be a positive legacy that nobody will begrudge him. The first thing the Government must do, with help from all the political parties, is establish a degree of coherence about what we must achieve and the framework for it. The one thing that could spoil the Games for the enthusiastic sportsman is the idea that we might squeeze out those benefits by taking all the funding for the event and not leaving enough for the legacy. We will not get the regeneration that is required to turn this enthusiasm into participation in local sports clubs. We will not get people deciding, &#147;I&#146;ll try that sport&#148;. Increasing sports participation will probably happen through the minority rather than the mainstream sports. People will say &#147;I&#146;ve seen that and I&#146;ll try it&#148; and &#147;That looks like a sport I&#146;d like; I&#146;ll find out how it&#146;s done&#148;. This is one of the great educational aspects of any Games. People see something done really well and think &#147;I&#146;d like to try that&#148;. Olympic success can do that as well as the educational aspect.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07030136000225"></a>Can the Government confirm that there is a certain point beyond which they will not go in drawing in the budget to the Olympic centre? The sporting legacy for the country could very easily be damaged. Indeed, there is already a fear that that will happen, reflected in the briefing we have received. Can the Government take this opportunity to say that we will not allow all the football pitches in south-east England, for example, to be neglected for two years to make sure that the Olympic budget gets everything, and will they repeat it often? They must state that there is a limit and that we will make sure that there is something to pass on. The Government have to ensure that their finances, as well as the finances of the Olympic bid, are well organised. I know there is a line beyond which the Government do not have direct authority, but they are the people who can do it if anybody can; they need to make sure that this is protected. If they do not, a lot of what has been debated here will not transpire, and we will not get the benefits.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07030136000226"></a>With regard to the health benefits that will flow from the Olympics&#151;I thank the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, for referring to a point I raised earlier about sports medicine&#151;the direct aesthetic and health-related benefits of being fit will be a bonus. Taking account of the stories in the press at the moment about zero-size models and super-heavyweight10 year-olds, this is a point at which we can say that there is a way of giving a positive example of what you can do. In their whole thinking on this topic, the Government must address how the cultural themes, and everything else that has gone behind this, can be worked in. The fact remains that the sporting idea at its centre must be protected and preserved.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1675"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07030136000227"></a>I come to one of the more difficult points that I will raise in the debate about the Olympics and sport generally. It is a criticism, I am afraid, of the Paralympic movement. Many of us on these Benches would see this as an odd thing to start with&#151;especially for somebody who holds the brief for both sports and disability, as I do. I am not against the Paralympics in any way, but there is a major problem at the moment. Those who have a learning disability are no longer included. This is the result of probably one of the most heinous bits of cheating, and of breaking the Olympic spirit, that has ever occurred. The competition in the Paralympics is to be the best inside your own field, where you have the idea of competition and a level playing field. In 2000, a group of Spanish athletes infiltrated the Spanish learning disability basketball team, cheated, and got the gold medal. They damaged the spirit of the Olympics. In my opinion, this is as bad as any drug cheating that has taken place. Indeed, it is possibly worse. By not getting these groups back in, however, you punish the athletes who were not cheating, the people who have only that opportunity to compete at this level. You also remove a whole stream of funding and competition opportunities on the wayup.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07030136000228"></a>I do not know whether the Minister had warning that I intended to raise this subject. Does the noble Lord have any idea about what the Government are going to do? How will this be taken forward to the relevant bodies? This decision also takes in those with Down&#146;s syndrome. You can check those with Down&#146;s syndrome very easily. I have a long-standing association with the UK Sports Association for People with Learning Disability. If you meet many of the athletes involved, you do not realise that they have a problem until you have spoken to them for a certain period of time. It is usually physically apparent for those who have Down&#146;s syndrome&#151;you can chromosomally test for this, I believe.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07030136000229"></a>Why are we not encouraging this group back in? I hate to have to leave on this one point, but the Olympics are for everyone. Can the Government please give us an assurance that they will address this matter?</p>

As your Lordships have highlighted today, the legacy planning for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was more central to our bid than it has been to any previous host city. The Olympic Delivery Agency has gone as far as to suggest that this was,</p>
<ul><a name="07030136000266"></a>&#147;the first time that Games and legacy planning has worked hand in hand&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1676"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1676</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07030136000252"></a>The Olympics were won with a bipartisan approach and the Bill discussed last Session had cross-party support. I am sure all in this House would like the 2012 Games to secure a lasting legacy of economic and social benefit, not just for east London, but for the UK as a whole. The question is: will they?</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07030136000232"></a>Today&#146;s debate has picked up on four key issues, which are considered the backbone of the 2012 Games legacy: the regeneration of east London; the provision of permanent venues for future use; an increased participation in sport, particularly at school and community level; and a boost to the economy, predominantly via tourism, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07030136000233"></a>There are positive legacy aspects. The cost-benefit study by Arup shows that, as a direct result of hosting an Olympic Games, there are examples of quantifiable benefits in terms of additional tourism. The job creation aspect of the development, production and regeneration is also very clear.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07030136000234"></a>However, there are worrying aspects. Skills Active has warned that we should not presume that holding the Games will naturally inspire inactive people to change their ways. Indeed, the Central Council of Physical Recreation does not believe that there is any evidence that previous Olympic Games have instilled a long-term legacy of participation; it is a view backed up by other research. The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport has expressed concern about the struggle permanent venues may have to maintain commercial success after the Games. The details of the plan to deliver the commercial and residential future development envisaged for the Olympic Park, post-Games, are yet to be finalised.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07030136000235"></a>I understand that the Government&#146;s response to the report of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sports is due on 26 March. In advance of that, do Her Majesty&#146;s Government intend to publish a plan, as recommended by the Select Committee, on how they hope to achieve a significant increase in sport and sporting activities in Great Britain at community and grassroots level? The benefits of such an increase in sporting activities have been eloquently expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, and the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord Addington.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07030136000236"></a>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made statements in the press about increasing the number of hours of sport that will be available for school children. It is not clear how this will be achieved. Are Her Majesty&#146;s Government going to comment on this, and indeed on any of the other recommendations?</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07030136000237"></a>Funding of the Olympic project has significant ramifications, to put it mildly, for all areas of the potential legacy. Some of your Lordships have spoken on this. In the words of my honourable friend in another place, Hugo Swire, it is a &#147;gross incompetence&#148; on the Government&#146;s part that they failed to include in the initial estimates potential inflation in building costs, VAT, or a realistic contingency fund&#151;let alone the as yet unconfirmed security costs. Are there any other surprises, such as decontamination costs, still to come?</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07030136000238"></a>The original budget&#151;which Ministers assured this House and the other place on numerous occasions was robust&#151;was generally supported. But only 19 months  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1677"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1677</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on, the estimated cost of staging the 2012 Games has had hefty increases. What will the cost be in three years' time&#151;or at this rate, what will the cost be next month? When will the Minister be able to tell us the true cost of the project and provide the details asked for by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee?</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07030136000239"></a>We all know stories of the building work overrunning on both budget and deadlines. What chance is there of being able to avoid this type of problem when there is such a lack of clarity in the first place? I am sure that the Minister will have been grateful and will have welcomed the fine advice of the noble Lord, Lord James&#151;given at no charge. The ever-burgeoning bill, coupled with the Secretary of State's failure to make a convincing case that the management exists to ensure that money is put to good use and the silence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is jeopardising the project. The London 2012 chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Coe, and chief executive, Paul Deighton, have both highlighted that this increasing uncertainty is making it difficult for them to raise sponsorship from companies to pay for that part of the Games which is to be funded by the private sector.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07030136000240"></a>Today there have been calls for caution regarding the possible serious consequences for the charitable and voluntary sector by any further diversion of funds from the lottery's good causes to the Olympic infrastructure. Even before any further increases&#151;which, after reading the recent press, we are so nervously anticipating&#151;there is a brake on the development of any new programmes for the immediate future. There will also be significant shortfalls for current published programmes. It is ironic that one of these, lottery funding to sport, was reduced from &#163;397 million to &#163;264 million last year. Can the Minister please assure the House that he will look elsewhere for extra funds and that there will be no more demands on the lottery? If there were, it would have a serious effect on the charities and organisations that the lottery was set up to assist.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07030136000241"></a>We on these Benches believe that if this project is to be a success and encourage the legacy which we all support, there must be proper management of the project so that budgets, cost projections and timetables are met. The Secretary of State agreed the original budget and must now deliver the goods. That is what needs to be done if there is to be a lasting legacy of economic and social benefit.</p>

I particularly appreciate the success of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, in tabling the debate and thank her for her opening contribution, which I think set the tone for the debate. </p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07030154000004"></a>Of course there are anxieties about the Olympics and all sorts of questions which the Government cannot resolve at this early stage in the development of the project. However, we are making substantial progress. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howard, for indicating that the bid and subsequent developments on the Bill enjoyed bipartisan support&#151;in fact, support  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1678"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from all sections of the House. I am a little dismayed that his contribution was the only one in the debate that focused entirely on negativism about the Games.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07030154000005"></a>Perhaps I may make the obvious point on costs. Of course costs are an important dimension of the Olympics; but the Sydney Olympics, which received considerable praise for how the Games were conducted and for their legacy, did not produce a budget for the Games until two years before they took place. We are under some onslaught from the opposition Benches because we do not have a full budget five years before the Games, despite the fact that the International Olympic Committee has recognised the considerable progress that we have already made. The extent of the progress made will be recognised&#151;I am very grateful to my noble friend Lady Morgan of Huyton, who can comment authoritatively on these matters in view of her participation with the authority&#151;although the site that has been chosen and is being developed and cleared is a monumentally difficult one to address. But that is the strength of the legacy. Into one of the most difficult areas of east London are going the substantial resources necessary to create a significant legacy indeed.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07030154000006"></a>So although I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Howard, says, I say to him that a range of wholly speculative figures have been cited by the media in the past few months and claimed to be the cost of the Games. In fact, one expects one or two newspapers to lob another several hundred thousand pounds almost every week on to the cost they have identified. We are not in a position at this stage to confirm the cost of the Games. A range of speculative figures are being bandied about.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07030154000007"></a>We recognise the importance of getting a budget as soon as we can. Discussions are continuing within government on the cost issues, including wider security, tax and contingency provision. We will make an announcement in due course once these discussions have been concluded. I think that noble Lords opposite ought to restrain their current onslaught against a background where our position on the Games is relatively well advanced in comparison with other hugely successful Games.</p>

<a name="70301-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07030154000008"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord James, that lessons have been learnt from the Dome and developments of that time. He reinforced those lessons today and his speech will be noted with the greatest care. He will recognise that some of the mistakes made on the Dome were previously appreciated and acknowledged. That is leading to a very different approach by government to the Olympic Games.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07030154000009"></a>I want, however, to follow the main tenor of the debate and talk about the enormous legacy that can be created by the Games&#151;an economic and sporting legacy, and a hard legacy in the construction of buildings of dramatic architecture, several of which will continue to provide enormously significant facilities after the Games are over, on brownfield land which is derelict, contaminated and heavily scarred by Victorian industry. The Games will transform an area that has been neglected for so very long.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07030154000010"></a>Another aspect of the hard legacy on which my noble friend Lady Ford enjoined us is that we should ensure that the local community also benefits directly.  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1679"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1679</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>After the Games are over, there will be 9,000 new homes in and around the Olympic Park and nearly 40,000 new homes in the immediate area. These will be built in a hugely disadvantaged part of London. I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, for identifying the nature of the problems of the East End and the surrounding boroughs. It seems to me that all too often many decision-takers, and certainly those who comment on the Government&#146;s decisions, know the West End of London, the route of their journey to Parliament, Whitehall and the main railway stations well&#151;except that they tend not to know Liverpool Street so well&#151;but the land beyond Liverpool Street and the City is relatively less well known to them. As the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, emphasised, these boroughs have the highest unemployment rate in the country and deprivation on a level unmatched elsewhere, although we recognise that other parts of the country also need careful attention in that regard.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07030154000011"></a>The benefits of the Games must be measured in hard opportunities for the people. They will mean improvements in skills and opportunities. The Olympic Games will create construction and development opportunities. I also bear in mind the point that the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, emphasised about the health of people in deprived areas. There is no doubt at all that the five boroughs reflect their poverty in those terms. I understand his very important point that it is time that we shift even greater emphasis to aspects of mental health, and that poor physical health often derives from the poor state of mind of people who, for all sorts of reasons, feel unable to cope. I think he will recognise that some of these points are being registered very forcefully in other aspects of government activity within the Department of Health, and that there is a growing emphasis on the need for additional resources to be allocated to mental health. We want the Games to give an uplift to the East End and to lift morale, which will itself help to provide extra resources and an optimistic commitment to the Olympics among the people there, and to the circumstances in which they live.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07030154000012"></a>The five boroughs are co-operating extraordinarily well on the Games. There is no doubt at all that they see the opportunities that they offer, and that is why they are positive. Everyone recognises that we must get a balance between benefits and costs, but it is also important to recognise that we have an obligation to provide the highest quality Olympics that have ever been held. We face challenges ahead in that regard. One such challenge is behind us: the Sydney Olympics were spectacularly successful. We have every expectation that those in Beijing will hit new heights. We face a significant challenge if we are to produce the best Games ever and the Government are all too well aware of that.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07030154000013"></a>The usual constructive suggestion was made that these problems will best be solved by having a Cabinet Minister devoted to them as his or her sole occupation. I appreciate the attractions in changing the organisation of government. However, when I replied to a question on that matter two days ago, two former Cabinet Ministers said they did not think that changes of specification and responsibilities at Cabinet level added a great deal. I do not think that the Olympics will be  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1680"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>helped by a change in government organisation. The Olympics will be well delivered only if all government departments with responsibility in this area collaborate effectively. That is what we need to ensure. The very fact that we have set as the objectives the range of benefits which were identified in this debate helps greatly in this regard. I am confident that if we need to change government structure, that change will be effected. I think that it will be recognised&#151;the Olympic committee recognises this&#151;that, having won the bid, the government response to the challenge of preparing for the Games is far more advanced than any previous arrangements for such Games.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07030154000014"></a>As was to be expected, the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, emphasised the enormous tourist advantages of the Games and the importance that we should attach to the wider tourist benefits to be gained across the whole of the United Kingdom. I link that with the other theme which came across strongly throughout the debate&#151;that the Olympic Games will constitute a showcase for Britain. I hope that one of the aspects of that will be medals won by Britain. However, we can bet even more safely on the fact that we can provide for tourists to Britain an absolutely unparalleled experience in our artistic and cultural legacy, as several noble Lords mentioned. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, emphasised the cultural dimension of the Games, as did the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe. We need to recognise across the nation that the Olympic Games will put the United Kingdom as a whole very much in the spotlight, in the same way that we are already seeing an enormous shift in the world&#146;s perspective on China. Its economic development is the most significant factor in that regard but we should not underestimate the showcase that the Olympic Games will provide for China too. The Games constitute a very great opportunity for the United Kingdom given its enormously rich cultural assets. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, for emphasising the contribution that Wales can make in that regard, but it applies to all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07030154000015"></a>We want to link cultural and artistic aspects to the cultural Olympiad which will run alongside the Games. Cultural aspects of the Games do not comprise just the opening and closing ceremonies although those provide the most dramatic showcase and appear on worldwide television. The Games are an opportunity to celebrate the values of the Olympics and the cultural dimension attached to those. We are planning to develop that across the nation.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07030154000016"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford brought a different dimension to the debate. He referred to the multicultural setting in east London in which the Olympics will take place and to the need to provide a lasting legacy of sound values for young people and communities. I very much appreciated his contribution. The noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, said that he was also moved by the speech. The Olympics will take place in a part of east London that needs to be given a sense of hope and to be the subject of good news rather than the bad news with which it is often associated in the media. The Games should lift young people&#146;s idealism. The churches have a great deal to offer in that regard and all faith organisations in the multi-faith community of  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1681"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>east London can play their part. We should appeal to them to do so because their influence in east London is so very strong. That strength needs to be built on.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07030154000017"></a>Given her responsibilities and roles outside the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, made a very measured, constructive speech in which she emphasised the necessity of maintaining high morale and support for the Games. She pressed upon us the damage to morale if we were unable in due course to produce a proper budget. I assure her that we recognise that factor. These are not easy issues. There is no doubt that certain aspects relating to the development of the Games, not least the nature of the site, are proving challenging with regard to costs. But I assure her that we take her representation seriously. We recognise the advantages that we can derive from being able to make progress in the near future on the budget. I hope that she will recognise that every energy is being devoted towards that objective.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07030154000018"></a>I was grateful for the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Newby. We recognise that the Olympic Games present an enormous opportunity within schools and educational programmes to promote commitment to sport and Olympic ideals. I agree that we needto make progress in that area. We are devoting some &#163;40 million towards a trust to promote sport and the cultural dimensions of the Games. He will recognise that this is a pump-priming activity. However, there is no doubt that one department of government which sees the enormous opportunities of the Olympic Games is the Department for Education and Skills. Several noble Lords emphasised that we need to change the culture of young people. The noble Baroness commented that we must move from being couch potatoes. There are opportunities. In the past year, we have been supporting the Schools Games. They made an enormous impact. We recognise that we have to provide opportunities for competition for young people. We have to move sport up the educational agenda. It will be recognised that in the past things were not read in these terms. We know the costs of the selling-off of playing fields in previous decades. A stop has now been placed on that. But what is more important is that within schools we recognise&#151;it is why we emphasise it within the school curriculum&#151;the great importance of the commitment to physical activity and exercise. Those factorsall relate to the stimulus which the Olympics can provide.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07030154000019"></a>It has been an interesting and in many ways an enormously constructive debate. Every noble Lord who participated has recognised the challenge which the Olympics present. Five years from the delivery of the Games, we see the challenges rather than achievements. Of course, the Government are vulnerable to the charges presented by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, in a series of detailed questions to which there are not immediate or easy answers. I make this appeal to him. First, we will meet the issue with regard to costs very shortly. Secondly, of course the role of the Opposition is to challenge the Government, but let us recognise this fact: we shall deliver on behalf of our nation the best Olympic Games ever only if everyone in this country is committed and devoted towards that objective. We need the help of all parties. We need to sustain all

Today we have had a debate which should encourage him in that bipartisan activity rather than in being too critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07030154000020"></a>The Government are pleased that the Motion has been timed for today. It was important that the Olympic Games were brought to the fore at this stage. I congratulate the noble Baroness on having done so.</p>

I thank all noble Lords who offered insights. I found particularly valuable the comparisons with the Millennium Dome, the Manchester Commonwealth Games and Barcelona, and even failed sporting bids. I referred to turning couch potatoes into runner beans. When the noble Lord, Lord Lee, spoke about the three &#147;p&#148;s, the debate risked taking a distinctly vegetarian turn. I particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Davies, for his response on behalf of the Government. I congratulate the Government on the progress to date in preparing for the Games.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07030154000022"></a>In summary, I remind the House of my key points. We need to focus on the benefits which the Olympics will bring. We need to work hard now to achieve them. The legacy of the Olympics and Paralympics needs to be more than medals and venues. There is the opportunity to bring lasting change, both physical and social, to east London. But that requires clarity on which body is in the lead between 2012 and 2020, and that body needs the powers and resources to deliver. It also requires public and private sectors jointly to commit to bringing more of the workless into employment, not through worthy but unsustainable job-creation schemes but by identifying the needs of employers and helping people without jobs to meet those needs through appropriate training and support. We must also learn lessons from our recent past. We know that regeneration will be painfully slow unless the infrastructure to establish true communities and link them to existing workplaces is created too.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07030154000023"></a>Lastly, to deliver a successful legacy as well as the Games needs a clear commitment from government. There are two key roles. The chairmanship of the ODA needs to be resolved and I continue to believe that we need a Cabinet-level Minister whose job is to bang heads together across departments and to champion the legacy. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>

The UK first deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992, as part of UNPROFOR, in response to inter-ethnic violence resulting from the collapse of the former Republic of Yugoslavia. We are all sadly familiar with the atrocities committed during the Bosnian War, which resulted in an estimated 100,000 people killed and the forcible displacement of some 1.8 million people.&#147;After three years of conflict and following a NATO air and land campaign, a ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina was agreed in 1995. This was followed by the brokering of the General Framework Agreement for Peace&#151;more commonly known as the Dayton agreement&#151;underpinned by the deployment of NATO forces.&#147;The international community has retained a military presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina since then, initially through NATO and, since 2004, through an EU force. At its peak, the international community presence, under NATO, amounted to some 60,000 troops, including some 12,000 UK personnel. &#147;Today there are approximately 6,000 international troops in EUFOR, of which some 600 are from the UK. This significant reduction over the years is testimony to the continuously improving security situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. &#147;With the UK&#146;s involvement in the UN, NATO and now EU forces, we have been operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina for some 15 years, contributing to the maintenance of a safe and secure environment. Indeed, we led EUFOR for its first year of operations and have been the lead nation in Task Force (North West). &#147;Over the years, UK troops have been engaged in large numbers of operations to recover illegally held weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as assisting the local authorities to combat organised crime. I would like to set out the detail of some of our successes.&#147;There are still dangerously high levels of small arms and light weapons in Bosnia-Herzegovina and, while a number of international organisations are implementing initiatives in this field, they are all dependent on donors. Last November, I had the pleasure of opening an explosive waste incinerator designed to destroy surplus small arms ammunition. The UK funding for that project amounts to some half a million pounds.&#147;In addition, the UK continues to fund the training of junior officers from all of the three main ethnic backgrounds, thereby contributing to the building of the state. In this financial year, UK support for this project is in the region of&#163;1 million. The UK is also assisting in the development of the NATO trust fund mechanism to facilitate the resettlement into civilian life of up to 6,000 personnel made redundant through defence reform processes. The project will aim to provide training andadvice to former soldiers who are returning to civilian life.  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1684"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;It is clear that Bosnia-Herzegovina is becoming increasingly safe. In recent years, there have been increasing indications of a security situation that is approaching normality. Parliamentary and presidential elections took place last year, and they were judged to be free and fair. Significant steps in defence reform have been made, resulting in the establishment of a single, multi-ethnic military force that is compatible with NATO. That has resulted in Bosnia-Herzegovina being able to contribute a small number of troops to operations in Iraq. &#147;Perhaps most important, the majority of people displaced from their homes during the war have chosen to return, many of them to areas where they do not belong to the majority ethnic group. In recognition of progress in all those areas, Bosnia-Herzegovina was invited to join NATO&#146;s Partnership for Peace programme last autumn, on the condition that there will continue to be full co-operationwith the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. NATO will closely monitor its efforts.&#147;The time is right, therefore, to reassess the role of the international military presence. In December, EU Foreign Ministers agreed in principle to transition EUFOR from a large dispersed force structure to a smaller, centralised one. On Tuesday, at a meeting of the Political and Security Committee, EU member states gave the final approval, in light of the continually improving security situation, to this change. The resulting reduction in force levels, from approximately 6,000 troops to 2,500 troops, will allow Bosnia-Herzegovina to take more control of its own affairs. The EU decision to move to transition is in accordance with clear military advice that the security situation is stable and that the local authorities are able to cope with all but the most serious incidents.&#147;The Welsh Guards, who are currently deployed, will therefore not need to be replaced with any further manoeuvre troops. More than 600 troops, principally from the Welsh Guards, will return to the United Kingdom. That will mean that the UK&#146;s future in-theatre commitment for the next phase of EUFOR will be a small number of staff officers in the Sarajevo HQ, although we will continue to contribute to the pan-Balkans operational reserve force. A small number of troops will be neededto ensure a smooth transition to the new EUFOR structure and to dismantle the base at Banja Luka.&#147;As we come to the end of UK military operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we can look back and see the contribution that our Armed Forces have made to the rebuilding of a country destroyed by conflict. As with other theatres of operation, they havebeen central in establishing a secure environment in which political solutions and reconstruction can be pursued.&#147;But while much has been achieved by the UK, our efforts have not been without significant losses. We must remember those UK service men and women who were injured or who laid down their lives trying to protect the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I pay tribute to them. A series of commemorative events, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina

I will provide further detail of these events in due course.&#147;But we must look forward as well as back. There is still progress to be made, particularly in pushing forward key political reforms, ensuring less nationalism in political discourse and developing state-level institutions. The UK must, and will, remain engaged as Bosnia-Herzegovina strengthens her position within Europe and beyond&#148;.

I declare an interest as a trustee of the Fund for Refugees in Slovenia, which was founded to provide relief to Bosnian refugees, primarily in Slovenia. The charity has been concentrating on helping Bosnians to return to their pre-war homes, particularly in the Srebrenica region. I join the Minister in paying tribute to Rifleman Coffey, and from these Benches we send our condolences to his family and friends. We also echo the Statement in remembering all those United Kingdom service men and women who died or were injured trying to bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past 15 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07030154000028"></a>Much progress has been made in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we welcome those successes referred to in the Statement. However, it would be naive to see this announcement as an end to all the problems there and to expect a smooth transition for Kosovo. On every front, 2007 looks set to be an extremely challenging year for the Balkans region. Serbia remains an unstable country that is led by a radical party whose leader is currently in The Hague facing charges of genocide. The recent unrest in Kosovo, and Belgrade&#146;s unwillingness to engage constructively in the final status talks, have cast a shadow over President Ahtisaari&#146;s proposals for supervised independence in Kosovo. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, separatist forces in the entity of Republika Srpska continue to hamper Bosnia&#146;s progress. Too many Serbs believe in a greater Serbia and that all Serbs should live together. What message is our pull-out sending them? Will they not be emboldened by the lack of an international military presence that has long served as a deterrent to their aspirations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07030154000029"></a>High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling has just announced an extension of his role until 2008, which is an extra year on top of his original mandate. That reversal of an earlier decision has been taken after a realistic assessment of the obvious uncertainties in the region. At the same time, the decision has been made to reduce the international military presence by cutting EUFOR numbers from 7,500 to 2,500. Will the Minister explain the remarkable discrepancy between those two assessments of Bosnia-Herzegovina&#146;s stability?</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07030154000030"></a>If the Bosnians are deemed incapable of taking greater control over their own affairs on a political level, why are the Government so confident that they can be self-sufficient on a military level? We hope that the decision has been taken because of a genuine belief that lasting stability can be maintained in the

What provisions have been put in place to allow a future increase in the number of troops in the region if needed?</p>

To argue that the region is now stable suggests that a lesser emphasis is now being put on the surrender of those two individuals. How many of our troops, and from what other countries, will remain in the pan-Balkan force, mentioned in the Statement? Finally, how many of our own troops will remain to continue the important task of training the Bosnian forces, particularly in the essential task of mine clearance?</p>

We warmly welcome the Statement as an indication of improvement in the security situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is always difficult to judge the exact moment when one can make a significant drawdown and there are inevitably some risks associated with it.</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07030154000033"></a>I note the report in today&#146;s <I>New York Times</I> of a statement released in Brussels that said that, in doing this,</p>
<ul><a name="07030154000241"></a>&#147;the Union would be prepared to &#145;re-establish a more robust military presence if needed&#146; in the months after the reduction&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000226"></a>Other reports talk about such a contingency for the next six months. The Statement does not mention that. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether there is such a contingency, so that it may be necessary to put some more forces in during the transition period. If so, is the UK committed to such a reserve of force capability?</p>

<a name="70301-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07030154000034"></a>The Statement reviews the history of our involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and shows how the progressive move from the military operations under NATO auspices to the civil military under the EU, and progressively towards total civil, has been the right approach. Italso shows that we have been at this problem now for 15 years. This is a lesson that we need to learn for our other stability operations worldwide: they take a very long time to achieve what we are seeking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07030154000035"></a>Does the Minister agree that this has been an excellent example of co-operation between NATO and the EU, in the handover from NATO to the EU? Does he also agree that it has been a milestone in the development of experience for forces operating as part of the European Security and Defence Policy forces and, as such, that it gives us some confidence for the future?</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07030154000036"></a>I regret that my noble friend Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon is overseas and cannot be here for this Statement, but I pay tribute to his important role as high representative. Much was achieved during his time in the post. However, does the Minister agree that there is still much to be done? The Statement reflects and welcomes the unification of the military forces. The three communities&#151;the Muslims, Serbs and Croats&#151;still disagree over unifying the police  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1687"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forces. What progress does the Minister see in that aspect? The high representative post itself is to be extended. To what extent does that indicate continuing concerns about the robustness of the political arrangements, rather than the security ones?</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07030154000037"></a>In this progression from military to civil, we will presumably need to be thinking EU-wide about more support for civil society in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Statement gives some indications of what the UK has been and is doing, but do we intend to do more in the future on the civil side?</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07030154000038"></a>The Statement is a welcome piece of news in the context of the over-commitment of our forces globally, which we have been talking about so much over the past weeks. It presumably also brings other benefits in equipment. Can the Minister tell us whether any support helicopters will be released that we might be able to use elsewhere?</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07030154000039"></a>The Statement is also a reminder of the scale of other EU forces that are involved in this operation. They, too, will feel the benefit of a drawdown. Does the Minister feel that this will make it easier toget them to contribute elsewhere, where the demands are needed? We have talked in particular about Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07030154000040"></a>I wonder whether the time is now right for the Ministry of Defence to produce a report on this operation&#151;the history of it, the lessons learnt and the successes&#151;as we have done with other operations. Perhaps the Minister might take that idea back to the Ministry of Defence. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, reminded us, other problems still remain in the Balkans, particularly in Kosovo and Serbia, and we will have to remain aware of what is happening there and hope that we can have similarly happy outcomes.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07030154000041"></a>Finally, reflecting the Statement, I make from these Benches a tribute to those members of the British Armed Forces who have over the years served there and done a fine job, in particular those who have been injured and killed. As I said earlier in the week when reviewing our contributions in Afghanistan and Iraq, we keep saying how much we value our forces. One tangible way of showing how much we value them is through how much we reward them. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body report is still awaited; it is still overdue. Perhaps the Minister could say something about that in his reply.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Garden, is absolutely right; this is an example of the success. We believe it is an excellent example of the positive impact that a European security and defence force can make. It is a positive example of the way in which the international community can come together to be a force for good in an area of great difficulty. It is also an example of the considerable length of time that these operations can take&#151;15 years. As we think about our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and our experience of the Balkans and Northern Ireland, it is worth reflecting on the considerable time it can take for the people within such countries to

None the less, it also tells us that there is a need for our Armed Forces to make a contribution under the comprehensive approach to security reform, after considerable fighting has taken place.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07030154000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked about the apparent difference between the political and military assessments. That reflects the assessment by the European Community that the time has now come for the emphasis really to shift to diplomatic measures. We accept that there are remnants of difficulty. He highlights the particular issue relating to war criminals and we accept this. But we and our partners do not believe that a military force is now the prime means by which these issues are addressed, and therefore the emphasis needs to go to diplomatic means. As the tripartite presidency of the country recently said, the point has been reached whereby responsibility for security can be taken by the country itself. This news is positive.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07030154000044"></a>In terms of the number of troops that were asked within our contribution, we are contributing approximately 180 personnel to support the NATO KFOR and UN mission in Kosovo. With regards to the reserved force, that is to be undertaken during the next two years by other countries, although we are the standby force. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, paid tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, for his contribution. There are a number of noble Lords in this House, some of whom are in their place today, who have together made considerable contribution&#151;both in terms of foreign policy and defence&#151;to the progress of this troubled region and to today&#146;s happier position.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07030154000045"></a>We need to continue to provide support on the civilian side&#151;for example, by providing police expertise&#151;and we will do so. We are looking at issues relating to equipment. I am not in a position to give specific details of helicopters, but we are looking at that issue. I will take back to the Ministry of Defence the noble Lord&#146;s idea about a report on operations and the lessons that can be learnt. Although we cannot make a read across from one theatre to another&#151;the geography and the situations are completely different in Afghanistan and in the Balkans&#151;none the less, we can see the effectiveness of the comprehensive approach and of the international community working together over a considerable time with a joined-up approach, with diplomatic efforts, and with efforts in defence, to achieve a successful outcome. I believe that can give us increased confidence in the strategy we are following in very difficult operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan will, in time, prevail. The noble Lord mentioned valuing our Armed Forces, as we do, absolutely. On the pay review, my understanding is that there will be a Written Statement on that tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07030154000047"></a>I have two questions. First, which European countries will provide the remaining 2,500 troops that it has been agreed should stay there as a continuing military presence? Secondly, can he assure the House that in taking this decision, the EU took into account the dangers arising from Kosovo, where an announcement, a plan, is being made, but where there will be much argument and dissension? The Rebublika Srpska argues that if Kosovo is allowed to secede from Serbia, it must be allowed to secede from Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is a dangerous and deceptive argument. Are his colleagues really sure that it will be pursued by diplomatic, political and argumentative means, as we all hope, and that there will not be tempted to take advantage of the run-down of UN forces to try to urge that argument by violence?</p>

With his deep experience of these matters, he is right to highlight that one needs to identify the tipping point; when the military effect has got to a point when the right thing to do is to draw down those forces. A balance has to be struck between defence and security reform and diplomatic efforts. That judgment has been taken very carefully by the European coalition, taking into account the dangers, recognising that there is a point when the presence of the troops is no longer the major way in which the pressures can be brought to bear and that the people can be encouraged to take responsibility for reform, allowing the diplomatic process to blossom.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07030154000049"></a>The judgment is that that point has been reached and that the contribution of the Armed Forces in the region is no longer necessary. I shall write to the noble Lord and give full details of the breakdown of troops and operations by country. I also mention the presence of the reserved troops who provide a strategic overwatch. In other operational theatres, we have a clear strategy by which we move to local overwatch and then to strategic overwatch, so that, if the situation deteriorates, troops are able to go back in. The situation will be closely monitored.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07030154000050"></a>An example of that relates to mine clearance&#151;the noble Lord asked about that. The role of the forces was to teach the country&#146;s own forces the skills of mine clearance and to support them in that. They have now got to the point when they can and should be doing that themselves. That is an example of where the time is right. It is a difficult judgment to make and it has been considered carefully, but we believe that this is the right time to make that transition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07030154000052"></a>On the Statement, I am very glad that it has been found possible to withdraw troops from Bosnia. That will certainly relieve undoubted overstretch and make it easier to sustain our military effort in Afghanistan.

I echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, about the wider picture concerning Republika Srpska and so on. Serbia is feeling a little roughed up at present. The autonomy and independence of Montenegro is one factor and there is also the position in Kosovo. Some of us have been quite surprised at how robust the Dayton process has proved to be. It is very important at this stage not to allow it to be destabilised.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07030154000055"></a>My other point is the wider role of the European Union, acting as a magnet&#151;and a magnate, when one considers the funds that go there. When, in 2000, we on the European Union Select Committee took evidence, I recall that each year &#8364;5 billion were being spent on the military and &#8364;1 billion on development and reconstruction. It would have been nice if it had been the other way around. Perhaps my noble friend could comment further on the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, about how far that is now in prospect. Although the European Union is acting as a magnet, lots of development work has to go side-by-side with governance in building up the economy.</p>

He recognises the essential importance of the Dayton agreement, its robustness and the way in which we must continue to pursue those ends. We have reached a tipping point in the comprehensive approach between the emphasis on military input and on diplomatic means to civilian support for the region, particularly as regards the police, where we are making a significant contribution, and as regards development and reconstruction. The emphasis needs to be on that,

I will write to my noble and learned friend with those details. I agree with him absolutely about the contribution made by the Welsh Guards.</p>

The striking point is that this young man, who only joined, I think, in August 2005, was already on his second tour. He had to be asked to do a second tour in Iraq. This adds considerable weight to the suspicion of my noble friend Lord Astor that the optimism expressed by the Minister in this Statement may surely, in many people&#146;s minds, be severely coloured by the worry that it has not necessarily been made on a purely objective judgment of the situation in Bosnia, but arises from the reality of the troops&#146; situation and the problems of manning-level faced by our Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07030154000060"></a>I ask the Minister, first, a question he has already partly addressed: if our hopes are disappointed, what arrangements are there for going back to restore what may be, by then, a much more difficult situation? Secondly, does this enormous reduction of forces in one go have the support of the Bosnian Government?</p>

The arrangements for response by the reserved forces have been identified. We then provide a standby force behind that, to provide a strategic over-watch.

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07030154000062"></a>This Statement, as the whole House recognises, is a positive statement of progress made after a considerable period. Nevertheless, it is in the context of significant pressure on our Armed Forces in other operational theatres. The way we, with our European partners, have been able to make this decision about Bosnia-Herzegovina reduces that pressure by a small amount. However, let me make absolutely clear that in each of our operational theatres we make decisions based upon conditions on the ground. To say that this decision has been taken to provide us with the ability to relieve pressure and support other theatres is just not true. We have, jointly with our European partners, taken a decision that is appropriate to the conditions as we see them. There is no intention to address issues in any other operational theatres.</p>

<a name="07030154000063"></a><b><a name="70301-0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07030154000302"></a>Lord Lloyd of Berwick</b> rose to call attention to the report of the Law Commission on reform of the law of murder including the question of mandatory life sentences; and to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07030154000064"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, the report that the House is now invited to take note of was published on 28 November 2006. It covers the law of murder and manslaughter in England and Wales, though not in Scotland. It is a long report and I do not suppose that any noble Lords have read every word. Nor have I. On such study as I have been able to make, I have concluded that it is by far the most complete and scholarly account of the present state of the law of murder that I have read. I cannot, in that respect, praise it too highly. I feel sure that the House will want to congratulate Mr Justice Toulson and his team, and Mr Justice Etherton, who succeeded Mr Justice Toulson, on their achievement. I do not agree with all their recommendations, but that is not surprising. On almost every subject on which they have consulted the public they have found differing views. There is one thing on which everyone is agreed: the present law of murder is a mess. It is described in paragraph 1.8 as,</p>
<ul><a name="07030154000242"></a>&#147;a rickety structure, set upon shaky foundations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000065"></a>I agree.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07030154000066"></a>I start with the question of sentencing and, in particular, the mandatory life sentence. Until we get that right, it is difficult to create a coherent structure for the law of murder and manslaughter. That is because murder, as has been observed so often, covers an enormous range of offences&#151;far wider than any other crime. At one end are the horrific offences which will always carry a sentence of life imprisonment, whether mandatory or not. At the other end are the offences where mitigation is so strong that one would normally be thinking of a sentence of two or three years, if that.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07030154000067"></a>Yet, as the law now stands, all these offences are subject to the same mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. That is inherently unjust. It means that the trial judge cannot tailor the sentence to the crime being tried. It ties his hands. Sentencing is one of the most essential functions that a judge has to perform. I will illustrate that later.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07030154000068"></a>First, it is sensible to describe how the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment has come about. When capital punishment was finally abolished in 1965 there were two alternatives. One was to give the trial judge complete discretion in sentencing, up to a maximum of life imprisonment. I favour that view, as did all the judges in 1965, led by Lord Parker, then Lord Chief Justice. He tabled an amendment to give effect to that view. It was carried in Committee in this House by two votes.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07030154000069"></a>The other view was to retain the mandatory life sentence, but to give judges discretion to recommend a minimum term to be served. This second alternative won very little support in either House in 1965, but prevailed in the end&#151;as things sometimes prevail in  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1693"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parliament&#151;because time was running out and the sponsors were desperate to get the Bill on to the statute book.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07030154000070"></a>I must make good my claim that the mandatory sentence is inherently unjust. I start with mercy killing. We all know the kind of case that comes before the courts more often than one would like. A husband has been nursing his terminally ill wife for many years; she begs him to put her out of her pain and eventually he gives in, smothering her with a pillow. He has acted out of the purest compassion, yet he is undoubtedly guilty of murder. The judge in such a case would be thinking of a nominal sentence&#151;three months, if that. Yet he is obliged by the law as it stands to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. Having pronounced that sentence, he adds in the same breath, &#147;But you need only serve three months&#148;. That is what the public find so hard to understand. The sentence, as currently pronounced in such a case, is simply a contradiction in terms. It is almost meaningless. Yet it is not meaningless in effect, because it means that he will be subject to a licence for the rest of his life. That cannot be right. As the Law Commission itself observed in paragraph 7.48, a lifelong sentence in such a case is neither necessary nor desirable.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07030154000071"></a>Take another case, that of Private Clegg, the soldier serving in Northern Ireland. On the facts of that case as they first appeared&#151;though, happily, not as they appeared after a retrial&#151;he fired at a car that had failed to stop at a checkpoint. No doubt he thought they were terrorists, but they turned out to be joyriders, one of whom was killed. Clegg&#146;s only possible defence was that he fired in self-defence, but that defence could not run as the car had already passed when the shot was fired. He was convicted of murder. When the case came to the House of Lords, I had the responsibility of giving the judgment. We dismissed the appeal because we had no alternative, but we made it as clear as we could that in our view the law was unjust; it could not be right to sentence such a man to life imprisonment. However, we could not put that right ourselves. That, we thought, was for Parliament, not for us.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07030154000072"></a>Exactly the same point emerges in the rather similar case of police officers who fire and kill in the belief that a suspect has a gun in his hand or a knapsack that is full of explosive. The officer has to make a split-second decision. Assuming he has no defence, he is guilty of murder. How can it be right that such a man should face a sentence of life imprisonment?</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07030154000073"></a>Take the case of the householder who is confronted with a burglar in the middle of the night. He grabs his shotgun and fires. Let us suppose that his reaction was excessive, or even irrational; he is guilty, as the law stands, of murder. I have no doubt that such a person should serve a sentence of imprisonment&#151;perhaps a substantial one&#151;but a life sentence seems entirely wrong.</p>

<a name="70301-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07030154000074"></a>I could go on multiplying cases. They are all cases that could have been dealt with easily enough if only Lord Parker&#146;s preferred solution had been adopted in 1965, as it so nearly was. They could be dealt with now under our existing law, if only we could get rid of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70301-0009.htm"/>


<a name="70301-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07030154000075"></a>It was cases such as these that led the House to set up a Select Committee chaired by Lord Nathan in 1988. It went into the whole question in great detail and called a number of witnesses to give evidence. Lord Lane, who was then Lord Chief Justice, and a great majority of the judges said that they were opposed to the mandatory life sentence. That was the view that the Nathan committee reached, and it therefore recommended that the mandatory life sentence be abolished.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07030154000076"></a>Then there was the Select Committee of the House under the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, which reported in 1993. Unfortunately he cannot be in his place today. It reached exactly the same conclusion from a different standpoint. It said, in paragraph 261:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07030154000234"></a>&#147;It would avoid the law being brought into disrepute either by the mandatory imposition of a life sentence in respect of an act which was widely thought to be compassionate and (by some) arguably justifiable, or by the inappropriate substitution&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000227"></a>and this is important&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07030154000243"></a>&#147;of lesser charges where it was expected that a jury would not convict for murder because of the mandatory life sentence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000228"></a>Then there was the report of a high-powered committee set up by the Prison Reform Trust, chaired by Lord Lane in 1994. That committee too came to the unanimous view that the mandatory sentence should be abolished. So far, although I may be wrong, I have not found a single instance of an inquiry that has supported the mandatory sentence. The question for the Minister is simply this: why have these recommendations been ignored?</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07030154000077"></a>Let me try to meet, if I can, some of the arguments that the Minister may advance. I can think of only three. The first and most obvious is that if it is abolished, some judges might not impose a life sentence when one is clearly required. The judges who try murder cases, however, are specially selected, have long experience and are all very familiar with the guidelines that describe when a sentence should be imposed. I assure the House of one thing: that judges are not reluctant to impose life sentences when they are appropriate. They should be trusted to do their job. Even if some judges made a mistake on occasion and did not impose a life sentence when they should have done, the Attorney-General can take the case straight to the Court of Appeal and have that put right. That argument simply does not stand.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07030154000078"></a>The second argument is the one usually advanced by Home Office Ministers: that it would &#147;send the wrong signal&#148;. But what does that mean? It presupposes that someone, when planning a robbery, says to himself, &#147;A life sentence is no longer mandatory, so I might as well take a gun with me and use it if necessary&#148;. I suggest that that is complete make-believe. What deters an armed robber from taking a weapon with them is the certainty of the life sentence, whether mandatory or not, and the length of time he will actually serve in prison.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07030154000079"></a>I will leave the third argument on one side. It may not be advanced by the Minister, and I hope it will not be.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07030154000080"></a>I turn to the report, to see how the Law Commission has dealt with the mandatory life sentence. What is its view? The answer is that we do not know; we can only  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1695"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>guess. The question was never put to the commission; it was outside its terms of reference. The commission was asked to assume the continued existence of the mandatory life sentence. One is bound to ask: why was it asked to make that crucial assumption? Was this not a key question on which the Home Office would have valued the view of the Law Commission, in the light of the recommendations I have mentioned? Why were its hands tied?</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07030154000081"></a>In the very few moments remaining to me, I must do my best to say what in my view would now be the correct structure for the law of murder and manslaughter. I would confine murder to the single case of intention to kill. I would not include the lesser degree of murder that covers intention only to cause bodily harm. I would then have four partial defences: provocation, as now; diminished responsibility, as now; a partial defence to cover the cases like Clegg and the police officer who shoots in the mistaken belief that a suspect is armed, or the householder who uses excessive violence; and a partial defence to cover mercy killing. It would not be hard to define this last defence, and it would be readily understood by the jury.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07030154000082"></a>What does it all come to? We should abolish the mandatory life sentence. We should have a single offence of murder, not the dual offence recommended by the Law Commission, covering the intent to kill. We should have four separate partial defences reducing murder to manslaughter. All other homicide offences short of an intent to kill would be covered by manslaughter. That way we would have a simple, coherent and, above all, workable structure for the law of murder. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07030154000084"></a>The difficulty is that Parliament has so many times lacked the will or time to implement so many of the commission&#146;s reports with or without amendments. Homicide reform has always been a hot potato; the enactment of a homicide act evaded the willingness of even Mr Gladstone. The most telling recollection in the report is a comment by a criminal lawyer at the beginning of the 20th century that a belief that a criminal code would be passed in the House of Commons was as naïve as expecting to find milk in a male tiger. I hope we have now moved on.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07030154000085"></a>The commission points out that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07030154000235"></a>&#147;The issue of sentencing is not within our remit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000229"></a>The 2003 guidelines to the Criminal Justice Act have been helpful. I have been involved in more murder cases than I can remember, and in my time at the criminal bar, the main issue in the majority of those cases was the sentence arising from the question of whether the crime was murder or manslaughter. Identity was exceptional as an issue. The issue in multihanders was the role of the parties and whether they committed murder or manslaughter in its various forms.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1696"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1696</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07030154000086"></a>As we have already heard, as far back as 1993, Lord Lane, who was formerly the Lord Chief Justice, advocated a discretionary sentence for homicide. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, that the mandatory sentence can lead to injustice. I venture to suggest the obvious: the British public easily understand the first limb of murder: the unlawful killing of another person with an intention to kill. I am less persuaded that they understand that the alternative to that is unlawful killing with an intention to do serious harm. In my experience, this is a matter that has worried and perplexed juries over the years, and I surmise that some have rebelled by returning verdicts of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter in serious harm cases. As counsel for the defence, I have sometimes slapped myself on the back for getting a manslaughter verdict, although I did not quite understand why.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07030154000087"></a>The commission comments that the inclusion of all intent to do serious harm cases within murder distorts the sentencing process for murder. I would go further than that because the anxieties of a jury can distort what should have been a proper verdict. I therefore welcome the strengthening&#151;or the watering down, depending on which end of the telescope one looks through&#151;of the alternative definition of killing through an intention to do serious injury with an awareness of a serious risk of causing death, which can be refined by the recommendation of High Court judges to include reckless indifference about causing death. For me, being aware of such a grim possibility or being recklessly indifferent to it is as good as proving an intention to kill. Any mitigation can be dealt with appropriately.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07030154000088"></a>Whether we should embark on two classes of murder is more controversial. The commission argues very cogently that two classes are known in other jurisdictions. The terminology does not worry me. It should deal with many of the anxieties of juries while they ponder their verdicts. I never cease in my admiration of how juries approach their tasks.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07030154000089"></a>I turn to the proposal of Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and Professor Terence Morris, who advocate a structure consisting of a single homicide offence. It would be committed on proof that the death was unlawful and that it was the outcome of the intrinsically unlawful conduct of the offender. The offences of murder and manslaughter would cease to exist. I believe that many years ago Lord Chief Justice Lane also recommended a single offence of homicide. The commission demurs and argues that the murder label is of the highest moral and social significance. I know what it means. How persuasive an argument that is in the cold light of day, I do not know. Some manslaughters are particularly heinous, and they do not carry the label of &#147;murder&#148;. I imagine the red tops&#146; field day if the Government were to abolish murder by calling it homicide. It is a measure that we have to take into account, perhaps put less starkly.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07030154000090"></a>The report states that judges would not welcome that offence. I do not know on what basis, and if I am right about Lord Lane, that undermines that argument. The report states that it would be too inclusive and would cover a surgeon&#146;s error so that his conduct  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1697"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1697</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would become murder. Perhaps this paragraph might be looked at again, because the conduct has to be intrinsically unlawful, so I find this paragraph difficult to follow.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07030154000091"></a>While tightening up the alternative limb of murder may ease the task of juries, are they not going to jump from the frying pan into the fire in wrestling with the concept of tiered killings? After wide consultation, the commission expressed confidence that it would not prove too complex and pointed out that there is already a tiered structure for non-fatal offences. I hope that it is right, and I enthusiastically endorse the already developed practice among judges of providing written directions in murder cases.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07030154000092"></a>There has undoubtedly been judicial tinkering. It is a rickety structure, but there was no alternative over 40 years of defining and redefining definitions of murder and manslaughter. The real problem is the need for reform at the border between murder and manslaughter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07030154000093"></a>The commission raised the question of whether &#147;serious injury&#148; should be defined. At present, where the charge is killing through an intention to do serious harm, the jury is entrusted with the decision about whether the harm intended was serious. Juries make that decision particularly well using the good common sense of 12 good men and women. I agree with the suggestions of experienced criminal lawyers, including a former DPP, that we should not embark on this field.</p>

It is clear that over the years Parliament has not attempted to identify the purposes of sentencing or to prescribe the relative priority that the courts should attach to them.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07030154000096"></a>Equally, the frequent calls for stiff sentencing for serious crimes such as violence, drugs or sexual offences are not necessarily in conflict with a wish to see fewer offenders in custody. Of course I look forward to the day when there is a determined effort to secure a shift in the public&#146;s perception of crime and punishment. For that reason, I welcome the Law Commission&#146;s thorough and thoughtful report. Unfortunately, however, the commission was working within one very important constraint, ably described by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, which was not of the commission&#146;s own making. The Government insisted, entirely wrongly, that the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations must take account of the continuing existence of the mandatory life sentence for murder. The commission was therefore unable to recommend the single change that would do the most to enable courts to sentence justly in homicide cases; namely, the abolition of the mandatory life sentence for murder.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1698"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1698</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07030154000097"></a>Abolishing the mandatory life sentence would give judges the ability to take all the circumstances of each case into account and to graduate their sentences accordingly, passing determinate sentences where appropriate and reserving life sentences for the most heinous cases. Because of this constraint, under the Law Commission&#146;s proposals, all intentional killings would be classified as first degree murder except for cases involving provocation, diminished responsibility or a suicide pact. Yet intentional killings vary greatly from planned and calculated killings for material gain or political motives to those committed under severe pressure and in emotional circumstances of great stress. Judges should be able to reflect these variations in their sentences.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07030154000098"></a>The proposals would classify as second degree murder homicides in which the offender intended serious injury but did not intend to kill and was not aware that his conduct involved a serious risk of causing death. This would enable courts to pass determinate sentences rather than mandatory life sentences in these cases. Extending the partial defence of provocation to include cases of excessive self-defence, where the defendant has acted in genuine fear of serious violence, would mean that courts could sentence these offenders appropriately and would not be bound, as at present, by the mandatory life sentence. Allowing duress to provide a defence to murder in certain circumstances would also make the law more rational and humane.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07030154000099"></a>I welcome the commission&#146;s proposal that the definition of diminished responsibility should be extended to include developmental immaturity in an offender under 18. Many children who kill do not have the developmental maturity or the control, so making a conviction for first degree murder is inappropriate. Such child offenders typically come from backgrounds involving physical, sexual or emotional abuse, parental neglect, family conflict and violence. Under the commission&#146;s proposal, such circumstances could justify a finding that the defendant had diminished responsibility for his or her actions. There are also offenders older than 18 to whom the definition of developmental immaturity could reasonably be applied. If the Law Commission&#146;s proposal on this point is accepted, there is a strong case for increasing the proposed maximum age for this partial defence to 21, rather than 18.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07030154000100"></a>The merits of some other aspects of the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations are more doubtful. The commission proposes, for example, that an offender who intends to cause serious injury but not to kill should be convicted of second degree murder even if they were unaware that their conduct involved a serious risk of causing death. Under the commission&#146;s proposal, the offender who punched a victim in the face, intentionally breaking his nose, would be guilty of murder if the victim fell, banged his head on the kerb and died from a brain haemorrhage. The average person might regard this offender&#146;s conduct as reprehensible, but would surely see such a case as justifying a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder. It is particularly unfortunate that the commission has proposed that offenders suffering from diminished responsibility should be convicted of second degree murder, rather than manslaughter, as at present. This would be a seriously retrograde step. It is completely wrong to describe  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1699"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people as guilty of murder whose responsibilityfor their actions is significantly reduced by mental disorder. The current law is right to describe these killings as manslaughter, and the description should remain.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07030154000101"></a>In seeking to justify its position on this point, the report argues that the same defendant will often make pleas of both provocation and diminished responsibility, and that it may not be clear which of these partial defences the jury has accepted. This is a completely inadequate argument for a proposal that would describe a youth with severe learning difficulties, who was persuaded by an older person to play a small part in a killing, as being guilty of murder. Where defendants plead both provocation and diminished responsibility, juries should be specifically asked whether they consider that the defence of diminished responsibility is made. If so, the defendant should be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder. Despite all this detailed criticism, the Law Commission&#146;s proposals would have the beneficial effect of enabling courts to pass fixed sentences in a considerable number of cases that now attract a mandatory life sentence. I urge the Government to go further and accept that the time is now right for the long-overdue abolition of the mandatory life sentence for murder.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07030154000102"></a>My final point is about mercy killings, which both noble and learned Lords mentioned, whereby a person acts, typically for compassionate reasons, to end the life of another person at that person&#146;s request. I am thinking here of legally challenging, but not uncommon, cases such as those of the retired policeman, Brian Blackburn, who helped his terminally ill wife, Margaret, a former hospice nurse, to die at her request; and Heather Pratten, who helped her son Nigel, who was dying of the devastating condition Huntington&#146;s disease, to end his life. Unlike the law in many other European countries, including Spain, Portugal, Norway and Italy, the law in England and Wales does not recognise the concept of homicide with consent. It makes no distinction between ending a person&#146;s life at their request, and ending life without any such request. The Law Commission noted in its 2004 report, <I>Partial Defences to Murder</I>, that,</p>
<ul><a name="07030154000244"></a>&#147;at present, in such cases, a conviction for murder, with consequent mandatory life sentence, can only be avoided by a &#145;benign conspiracy&#146; between psychiatrists, defence, prosecution and the court, to bring them within diminished responsibility&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70301-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07030154000103"></a>I am concerned about the reformulation of the defence of diminished responsibility which the Law Commission has proposed, which would, if successful, reduce a first degree murder charge to second degree murder rather than to manslaughter. This may help to tackle other types of cases where a life is unlawfully ended, but unless the fundamental issues to which mercy killings give rise are resolved by a full and dedicated consultation, as the Law Commission has proposed, the new definition of diminished responsibility will do little to prevent the benign conspiracies that I have described.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07030154000104"></a>In view of the issues at stake and the unpopularity of this aspect of the current law, I support the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that a full consultation on mercy killings should be undertaken as a matter of urgency; otherwise the benign conspiracy risks becoming

I have an interest in this matter as I was very proud to serve as the psychiatrist on Lord Lane&#146;s committee that was considering the penalty for homicide back in 1993. My views have not changed since the publication of that report. The law of murder is still in urgent need of reform, including in relation to expert psychiatric evidence in murder trials. I regret that subsequent Governments have remained set against what would be by far the most sensible and important reform, namely the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. Retention of this sentence militates against achieving individualised justice, both generally and specifically in relation to psychiatric factors relevant to proper sentencing.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07030154000106"></a>Given the current legislative climate, however, if the Government were to adopt the commission&#146;s proposed ladder principle and the distinction between first-degree and second-degree murder, then I assume that it would pragmatically be an improvement because fewer people would be caught by the mandatory sentence. It would chip away a little at that cliff face. However, it would still leave a proportion of cases inadequately dealt with. I express my thanks for some briefings that I have had recently from Professor Nigel Eastman&#151;a forensic psychiatrist at St George&#146;s, University of London, who has far more extensive experience of operating these provisions than I do&#151;and from forensic colleagues in the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07030154000107"></a>As regards the curious partial defence of diminished responsibility in the setting of abnormality of mind, the report recommends, without any discernible logic, that it is used solely in first- to second-degree murder reductions so that only if there was an intention to kill could the person plead diminished responsibility. But surely one ought to allow reduction from second-degree murder to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility too.</p>

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07030154000108"></a>Let me look closely at this defence of diminished responsibility. Back in the early 1990s it was used about 130 times a year. Now the numbers have dropped off to 20 or 30 a year and perhaps that is no bad thing. But there is an inherent mismatch between the constructs and methods of inquiry of law and medicine, including psychiatry. There is no doubt that the use of expert psychiatric evidence within contested trial hearings directed towards determining verdict has at times been an unseemly process, bringing forensic psychiatrists a good deal of discomfort and sometimes creating work for those ill qualified rent-a-doc figures who, thankfully, are less in evidence in the courts these days. Psychiatrists do not feel qualified to pontificate on degrees of responsibility, though they may be qualified to pontificate on abnormality of mind. So often it comes down to making a judgment on a sliding scale of moral quality. As one of my colleagues remarked to me, when someone

<a name="70301-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07030154000109"></a>There is, of course, the very rarely used defence of not guilty by reason of insanity, but psychiatrists agree that the defence of diminished responsibility is rather a blot on their practice. It is far better to use psychiatric evidence at the sentencing stage&#151;if the judiciary has the freedom over sentencing&#151;when a specialist opinion can be considered without the unseemly legal argument over the minutiae of the language used to describe types of abnormality of mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07030154000110"></a>The commission makes some proposals for modernising the definition of diminished responsibility. They are an improvement overall, but I would like further amendment to insert a further type of &#147;diminished capacity to form a rational judgment&#148;. I would like to see &#147;arising from a recognised medical condition&#148; as an appropriate wording to restrict &#147;abnormality of mind&#148;, and would further restrict &#147;immaturity&#148; to &#147;developmental immaturity as a result of being youthful in years&#148;. The current proposal is still too restrictive in regard to cases where there is a determined, even planned, intention to kill in the absence of any loss of control. Hence a severely depressed woman may kill her children on the basis of delusions that the world is such a terrible place that her children, whom she loves, would be better not in it, yet she might still be able to judge whether her actions were legally right or wrong. Alternately, a man may be paranoid and deluded about someone else and kill them in a planned way based on these delusions, yet still know legally or even morally that it is wrong to kill per se. There should therefore be a fourth basis for diminished responsibility to cover cases based on irrationality where there is no diminution of control.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07030154000111"></a>Some successful pleas of diminished responsibility are based on &#147;neurotic&#148; or even &#147;adjustment disorders&#148;&#151;which are not apparently very serious mental disorders&#151;or acute reactions to stress. That may be perfectly proper, but restricting any such defence to those with a recognised medical condition would ensure that the defence was grounded in valid medical diagnosis and encourage reference within expert evidence to diagnoses in terms of one or two international classificatory systems, without explicitly writing those systems into legislation. That would encourage a common approach between experts and improve understanding between them. It might also avoid individual doctors offering somewhat idiosyncratic diagnoses as the basis for a plea of diminished responsibility. Overall, it would encourage better standards of expert evidence and improved understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07030154000112"></a>The criminal law as it applies to mercy killing is in a mess. I am very pleased that the Law Commission called for a separate review of it and I hope that we will take this up urgently. We know that 50 per cent of people convicted of mercy killing, whatever their sentence, go on to kill themselves. How many more people must suffer as a result of this inhumane law?</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1702"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07030154000113"></a>At present, the wishes of the person who has been helped to die, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has said, are not relevant to the charge. The person who has helped the loved one to die can escape a long prison sentence only if he can show that he was suffering from diminished responsibility. The reality is that most of these cases involve a person who has a profound sense of responsibility and is definitely not in unsound mind. Time and again we see mercy-killing cases journey through the courts only to be dropped or reduced to a lesser charge on the grounds of diminished responsibility. In more than 15 years, not one mercy-killing case has resulted in a sentence for murder. Not one person has received longer than a 36-month sentence for manslaughter. The law is built on hypocrisy and still fails to protect the vulnerable.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07030154000114"></a>Whatever the outcome of a review, mercy killings will continue unless a law providing for assisted dying is in place, along the lines of the Private Member&#146;s Bill introduced last year. It is time for the Law Commission and the Government to listen to the public: 82 per cent of people want the law changed so that someone who is terminally ill and competent can ask for medical help to die. The benign conspiracies between psychiatrists and the legal profession, which the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, mentioned, bring the law into ill repute. For the moment, the Law Commission report sets the problem to one side, but I do not believe that the Government will be able to do so for ever.</p>

His criticism of the mandatory life sentence has two virtues: it has been relentless and it has been correct. We have now reached the stage where that which was the subject of earnest debate years ago is now, frankly, eccentric criminologically and socially mysterious. People simply do not understand the nature of this sentence in relation to some of the circumstances to which it is addressed. I agree that it needs reform.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07030154000116"></a>I turn to the Law Commission&#146;s report, which calls for much more substantial reform of the law of murder. First, I regard this report as the opening chapter in a new reform of the law of murder and certainly not the last word. On further consideration, it may be that different degrees of the law of murder and different ranges of sentence may turn out to be the appropriate reform. But I am certainly not satisfied with the present state of criminal law. Although it is years since I did a murder case, over the past 40 or 50 years we have had malice, foresight, recklessness and intent all the subject of different and profound House of Lords judgments, which is not an appropriate state of affairs in which to consider the law of murder as a clear crime.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07030154000117"></a>Reform is a general requirement. How are we to go about it? This is not a topic on which consultation&#151;helpful as it is&#151;is likely to be determinative. We are required as legislators to translate what we understand to be the overwhelming public feeling into rational and ordered legislation. Consultations apart, it is not the determinative  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1703"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1703</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part. We therefore should have, as did, I think, Professor Morris in the 1960s and 1970s, a detailed investigation of the history of murder over the past 10 or 15 years; that is, its type, the circumstance, and the way in which judges have applied the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and its appropriate schedule when determining the minimum period of sentence. That material is extremely important and, as was true when Professor Morris looked at it40 years ago, is likely to reveal now that most murders are what is said to be domestic, being within a family or close relationship; that very few are downright shocking killings by gun or knife; and that not many are horrible serial killings. So reform is not simply to be directed at the Law Commission&#146;s desire for legislative clarity, but to the real types of murder that confront our society.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07030154000118"></a>Secondly, as to the appropriate approach in such an area for the legislature, why not have the fullest pre-legislative scrutiny after a draft Bill has been publicly considered and, if necessary, not only Grand Committee debates but the calling of evidence before an appropriate Select Committee dealing with that reform? We really must try and get it right this time. That will require a new statute defining the law of murder. Its underlying characteristic should be&#151;I do not apologise for the word&#151;killing. Ending another person&#146;s life&#151;whether with intent, with recklessness or through compassion&#151;is a killing. Semantic fudge is not appropriate or sensible in this area.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07030154000119"></a>With that reform in mind, why stop with the law of murder? In 2000, when I made my maiden speech in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;full of legislative idealism, and untainted then by parliamentary reality&#151;I asked why we do not codify the criminal law. Well, it was then only 120 years since Lord Blackburn had produced a code, and only 20-odd years since the Law Commissioner had produced a draft; but, really, in the legislative frenzy to which we have been exposed in the past 30 years, is there no room in the Parliament of this country to make the criminal law satisfactory for the protection of its citizens and the proper functioning of its courts? Of course there is, and we should find the room.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07030154000120"></a>Why? Surely in the criminal law of this nation above all, coherence, clarity and certainty should find some place in our legislative endeavours. Surely the public would benefit, and the courts would be able to apply the law much more efficiently. The conclusion that we should all come to in a debate that is too short to consider detail, but rather should look to policy, is that we should reform the law of murder in the fullest and most comprehensive legislative way that we can contemplate, and then reform the criminal law. Then we can sit back as a legislature, and say that we have done something worth while for the country.</p>

I shall confine my remarks to this, except to endorse what has been said about the Law Commission&#146;s report giving a masterly expos&#233; of the current state of murder in this country.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07030154000122"></a>I was very struck back in 1989 by the detrimental effect that the indeterminate sentence had on prisoners. They had no framework in which to plan to structure their lives, and this equally made it difficult for the prison officers because the length of the tariff was not disclosed. Nowadays the minimum term is set by the trial judge and the offender knows its duration. However, the life sentence remains mandatory.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07030154000123"></a>We were very clear that the way in which to deal with murder was not to divide it into degrees but to give the judge the discretion to impose the sentence appropriate for that particular offence given all the relevant circumstances. I appreciate the fact that it was not within the remit of the Law Commissionto reconsider the abolition of the mandatory life sentence and that it has tightened the criteria for first degree murder and consequently narrowed the reach of the mandatory life sentence. But is the answer really to create more tiers to draw more dividing lines? Drawing lines creates anomalies either side of the divide and life will still be the maximum penalty possible for all three tiers, as it would be without any line drawing. I firmly believe that the Government should be bold, grasp this nettle, get rid of the mandatory life sentence and give the judges discretion to deal with the offence in the light of all the relevant circumstances.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07030154000124"></a>The Nathan committee found&#151;here I paraphrase something that Lord Nathan said in moving an amendment to abolish the mandatory life sentence during the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill, on18 April 1991 at col. 1565 of the <I>Official Report</I>&#151;that what families of murder victims wanted was that when murder had been committed it should be called murder, not downgraded to manslaughter; whether the sentence was an appropriate, determinate sentence or a life sentence was of secondary importance. I feel that the public may well take the same view.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07030154000125"></a>The punishment should be seen to fit the crime and there should be a meaningful period in custody. Rather than draw dividing lines, would it not be far easier to understand for everyone and have more appropriate results to ask, first, whether it was intentional killing and, secondly, given all the circumstances, what the penalty should be? Of course, the penalty could still be life imprisonment, but because it was appropriate rather than because it was dictated.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07030154000128"></a>I want to dwell on the unusual position occupied by the uniformed services in discharge of their duties and deal more briefly, if I may, with the deterrent value of mandatory life sentences. First, to illustrate the position of the uniformed services, and in particular the police, I shall draw some lessons from the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in Stockwell in July 2005. As many noble Lords will know, I served in all ranks of the police service, in the capital and outside, and during that time was trained to the highest level in the use of the whole range of police firearms. That training rightly emphasises at all times restraint, but sometimes circumstances can place almost intolerable demands on members of the uniformed services, when split-second decisions have to be made.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07030154000129"></a>We all remember the loss of life and injury on a very large scale that was caused when four bombs were exploded by suicide bombers on the public transport network in July 2005. Two weeks or so later, another attempt was made but the firing chains of those four bombs were faulty. The bombs failed to explode and the bombers escaped. The following day, police were watching a block of flats where one of the would-be bombers was believed to live. The unfortunate Mr Menenez lived in the same block, resembled the suspect and was seen to leave and travel by bus, first to one and then another underground station. He went into the station. The officers following him were instructed by radio by their control room that they should consider him to be a terrorist bomber and prevent him boarding the train. The officers on the ground were not in a position to evaluate that information for themselves. In that fraught atmosphere in London, in July 2005, they had to act decisively.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07030154000130"></a>Most of us would shrink from tackling a live bomb; certainly, we would not throw ourselves on to it in an attempt to defuse it. But, as we know, that is exactly what those officers did. They followed what they thought was a determined suicide bomber on to the train; they went forward when the vast majority of people would have retreated. They threw themselves on top of what they thought was a suicide bomber and they shot him before he could detonate the bomb that they believed him to be carrying. That was their training in the circumstances, extreme though the action might seem to be to some armchair critics. Suicide bombers use a number of different ways to detonate the bombs they carry and only instant fatal shooting, sadly, can guarantee that the bomb will not be detonated.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07030154000131"></a>Had those officers been correct in their belief and had Mr Menenzes in fact been a bomber, we should now still be praising their courage&#151;courage that would have undoubtedly seen the award of a George Cross. There are many examples of the award of VCs and GCs to those who have dealt personally, and with complete disregard for their own safety, with bombs that are likely to explode. But Mr Menenzes was not a bomber. He was an electrician, probably on his way to  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1706"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1706</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work. The officers will not be awarded medals and they face the very real risk of prosecution for capital crime. I can describe these circumstances in your Lordships' House because it has been decided not to prosecute them but instead to prosecute the Metropolitan Police, as an organisation, for offences under health and safety legislation, doubtless a route in which it is felt that the greatest exposure of all the facts can be assured.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07030154000132"></a>I do not pass comment on the decision-making process that took place in the control room that day. I have no knowledge of it and, in any case, it would be sub judice. Subsequent proceedings will doubtless produce some answers for us on that point. However, I am confident enough of the facts to know that the officers on the ground probably displayed enormous and exemplary courage and took decisive action which they thought was correct in those fraught and demanding circumstances. The action was not correct. They must have come very close to being prosecuted for it. Had events been only very slightly different, one surmises that a prosecution would have been brought against them, they would have been convicted of murder and a life sentence would have followed, no matter how great the pressures on them at the time.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07030154000133"></a>I do not suggest that the uniformed services, police or military alike, should be put into a special category. I do not suggest that they should be allowed to operate in a way that puts them above or outside the law. But it must be right that, if they are convicted, the court has the discretion to determine a sentence appropriate to the circumstances which, as I hope I have illustrated, can be utterly extreme and quite outside anything that the average person could ever experience.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07030154000134"></a>That leads me to my second point, on which I shall be brief. I do not believe that there is any deterrent value in the mandatory life sentence. Indeed, I doubt whether there ever was. It is said, perhaps apocryphally, that pickpockets operated around Tyburn gallows in Georgian London while convicted pickpockets were being executed. Whether or not that was the case, I believe that then, as now, it is the certainty of arrest and conviction that really deters, together with a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence. It is already common knowledge that a life sentence usually means a minimum of eight years or thereabouts. It is also common knowledge that premeditated murder, or murder where there is a callous disregard for the circumstances leading to death, will usually result in a very much longer minimum sentence.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07030154000135"></a>Hard core criminals know that today they can expect terms well in excess of eight years, but it is surely right to trust the judgment of the trial judge to distinguish circumstances where a degree of leniency is called for and to allow that judge to pass a shorter sentence in those circumstances. We have heard much comment today on mercy killing and I associate myself with those remarks. It would greatly improve the administration of justice for this most serious offence and would import a degree of sentencing particularity and sentencing accuracy that is sorely lacking at present. I support the Motion.</p>

Nonetheless, it was a matter that the Law Commission, the report of which we are considering, was debarred from taking into account or commenting on. Faced with that restriction, the Law Commission had to attempt to divide up the concept of unlawful killing, so that first-degree homicide had a mandatory life sentence, while the court had a sentencing discretion for second-degree homicide.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07030154000137"></a>As has been demonstrated time and time again, however, categorisation of murder does not go to the question of heinousness. That was the fatal defect of the Homicide Act 1957, which made some types of murder capital offences, but not others&#151;an anomaly that was highlighted in a passage quoted by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, who was the relevant Minister when the 1989 report was debated. The noble Earl quoted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07030154000236"></a>&#147;If you wished to dispose of your wife and not suffer the penalty of death you must not shoot her or drown her, but you could stab her, strangle her, poison her, or set her on fire and you would get away with it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/11/89; col. 454.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000230"></a>That meant, of course, that the only people who faced the death penalty for murdering their wives were those who had not done their research properly or who had not looked at the Homicide Act. They had, therefore, chosen the wrong method of doing it. This problem of categorisation will remain even if the proposal in the report of the Law Commission is accepted.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07030154000138"></a>A clear example of this is mercy killing, which will remain first-degree murder with a mandatory life sentence, because the categorisation depends on the intent of the accused, not on his or her motive and reason for the killing, or on their moral responsibility. There is an infinite range of similar examples, some of which noble Lords have already put forward.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07030154000139"></a>The solution&#151;certainly the best solution, and probably the only real solution&#151;is for the court to have a complete discretion in sentencing, which enables it to make the punishment fit the crime, and not to attempt to categorise the crimes, so that the categories fit the punishment. The 1989 Select Committee got it right when it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07030154000237"></a>&#147;The Committee consider ... that the right way to deal with this matter is not to divide murder into degrees but to give the judge a discretion to impose the sentence appropriate to the particular offence, taking into account all the relevant circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70301-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07030154000140"></a>The mandatory life sentence is, I believe, a sop that was given to those wavering on the abolition of capital sentences for murder. It was opposed by the Lord Chief Justice, and the great bulk of the judges, who wanted life imprisonment to be one of the sentences that was open to them in the general exercise of their discretion. The mandatory sentence is sometimes defended on the basis that killing someone is a uniquely terrible crime. But in any rational approach, that is just not true. As Lord Hailsham rightly said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07030154000238"></a>&#147;Murder ... though often described as one of the utmost heinousness, is not in fact necessarily so, but consists in a whole

</ul>
<a name="70301-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07030154000141"></a>I remember a case tried in the days of capital punishment by that great and good criminal judge, Mr Justice Wintringham Stable. A young mother had been, wholly rightly in law, convicted of the murder of her young child, in circumstances which did not quite fall within the definition of infanticide. The judge said to her: &#147;I now have to say something to which you should pay no attention. I can assure you that you will be back with your family very soon&#148;. He then passed the mandatory death sentence in low and hurried tones, and said to me afterwards, &#147;That should tie the Home Secretary's hands sufficiently&#148;. But not many of his colleagues were quite as robust as that.</p>

<a name="70301-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07030154000142"></a>Not only does the passage of the mandatory sentence give to those in court a wholly misleading impression; it also distorts the statistics. It is one of the reasons why people are able to say, &#147;Life sentences do not begin to mean it. You get out very quickly&#148;. If you put into the equation the mercy-killers who get out after three months although they have been sentenced to life imprisonment, of course you will get curious statistics. But the answer is that they should not be there. It may also be said that the mandatory life sentence has led to artificial distortion of the law where juries have found provocation or diminished responsibility contrary to the fact but out of a very proper sense of sympathy. All that would be avoided if the courts could pass a sentence that does fit the facts of the case. I urge the Government to go ahead and do that abolition. Some of the more subtle points, and perhaps the categorisation of mercy-killing, can then wait. If you have discretionary sentencing, you have solved most of your problems.</p>

If a member of the Armed Forces on duty in an area in which operational or emergency conditions apply, and in the course of that duty, in good faith and without any malice aforethought, shoots and kills a suspected offender and is subsequently judged by a court to have been guilty of committing an error of judgment, it is grossly and manifestly unjust that, because pointing a weapon and squeezing the trigger legally constitutes attempt, the only punishment that he or she can be awarded is a life sentence for murder instead of a lesser punishment more appropriate for an unlawful but not premeditated killing.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07030154000144"></a>By &#147;good faith&#148; I mean that there was no prior intent when he or she went on duty to harm anyone, let alone the deceased; that the accused, in taking action against a suspected offender, believed that he was acting in the line of duty and even following a lawful order or instruction, perhaps set out in a rules of engagement card, if one existed; or that he considered that there was imminent danger to himself or to others. The error of judgment&#151;if that indeed was what it was&#151;could so easily have been brought about  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1709"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by having to take a split-second decision about the imminence of that danger, when perhaps at the precise moment of firing the offender had passed by or turned away; or, surprisingly, no offensive weapon was found at the scene; or because a particularly stressful situation had contributed to an honest mistake.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07030154000145"></a>Whatever comes out of this debate to prompt Parliament to take action on modifying the law on murder and providing discretion about sentencing, I hope that earnest consideration will be given to the predicament of good men and true, serving their county under the most difficult circumstances, having to have imposed on them, and live with for the rest of their lives, a terrible life sentence for what, at the worst, was a culpable error of judgment made under considerable stress and strain when on duty. This has happened more than once in Northern Ireland and could easily happen at any time in Iraq or in any other places where our Armed Forces and, indeed, all our uniformed security forces&#151;what I have just said only echoes the excellent points made by my noble friend Lord Dear on the same sort of predicaments faced by police officers&#151;serve their country on active duty in the most complex and dangerous circumstances.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07030154000147"></a>It may be surprising that a former Lord Chief Justice should speak briefly on this subject. Certainly each of my predecessors of whom I had personal knowledge made speeches of some length on this matter, all focused on the subject on which I want to focus. Ironically, because of the terms of reference which were given to the Law Commission, it was not able to deal directly with the matter; that is, that the solution to the problem, which we all agree exists, is the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. Whatever the history or explanation of a mandatory life sentence following the offence of murder, events since that sentence was imposed have clearly shown that it is not the way to uphold justice in respect of what can be, and usually is, the most heinous of crimes.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07030154000148"></a>In recent times two important changes have come about in the sentencing process for those convicted of murder. The first change is that it is no longer the province of the Home Secretary to decide when a convicted person is to be released. If the Home Secretary, not the sentencing judge, were to determine when a person should be released, there would be some logic in curtailing the role of the sentencing judge. Formerly, a sentencing judge who had to deal with a murder case had no problem in determining what the sentence should be. You were spared the soul searching that took place in respect of many sentences. That matter was passed to the Home Secretary, though you were encouraged to write him a letter giving your views on the gravity of the sentence in order to help him.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1710"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07030154000149"></a>The second significant change that has taken place is the development of guidelines, which are now provided primarily by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, although exceptionally, and in my view mistakenly, the legislature occasionally intervenes. The Sentencing Guidelines Council has the benefit of an expert panel. With that expert panel&#146;s help, it can give the broad assistance that a sentencing judge needs to perform his or her role. Guidelines undoubtedly help. They mean that a judge now knows that if he departs from the guidelines, which can be and are subject to public debate and scrutiny by committees of Parliament, it will be the subject of a reference by the Attorney-General. So there is no risk of the judge misusing his discretion to the danger of the public. The fact that those two changes have occurred, I suggest, means that the time is ripe to look again at the mandatory sentence.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07030154000150"></a>The mandatory sentence is a blunt instrument. Justice today should be refined to deal with some of the cases which have been drawn to our attention by the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, to deal with the kind of cases we have heard described as mercy killing; and to deal with the cases where a defence of provocation and diminished responsibility is raised. In all those situations, if the judge has a discretion, he can take the approach which the facts dictate. There are difficulties if a case falls just without provocation and the person concerned is convicted of murder rather than manslaughter. The same very experienced judge to whom the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, referred was presiding over a case when I was still a pupil. My pupil master was running the defence of provocation. It was a case where the defendant was entitled to the greatest sympathy. As my pupil master started to develop the defence of provocation, Mr Justice Slade&#151;as he was in the habit of doing&#151;tapped the desk with his pencil saying:&#147;Mr Jones, if I were you, I wouldn&#146;t water the brandy&#148;. He had a sufficient confidence in our juries to know that with an appropriate summing-up, albeit one which would not enter the law of precedent, it was possible to achieve a just sentence without the law of provocation. That is another example of the fact that having a mandatory sentence which applies in one situation but not in another creates artificial situations and requires a judge to exercise those skills which only temporarily should be deployed by judges when the circumstances so demand.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07030154000151"></a>I urge the Government, as have those who preceded me, to take the straight and direct course of changing the sentence from a mandatory to a discretionary one. If that is not possible, I have sympathy with the recommendations of the Law Commission, although I urge caution because once you start stratifying an offence, even if it be murder, into murders of different degrees you run the risk of creating more problems than you seek to solve. However, I acknowledge that it has done noble work in trying to clarify the difficult concepts that are contained in the law of homicide at present.</p>

I speak with hesitation as a doctor who has no legal training but who, like every other doctor, is of course subject to all aspects of the law, and as one who often wrestles with end-of-life decisions and finds helpful the current &#147;bright line&#148; of the law in prohibiting deliberate killing.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07030154000153"></a>Therefore, I wish to concentrate on part 7 of the report, which has already been referred to with great compassion by my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd and others who have spoken. I will consider it from a medical context. The partial defence of mercy killing may need a different name, because the term &#147;mercy killing&#148; is morally loaded, presupposing and implying that the motive was purely compassionate and merciful. It does not encourage other secondary motives, if they exist, such as personal benefit, to be equally assessed, even though we are here talking about the deliberate ending of the life of someone who appears to be in great distress.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07030154000154"></a>It is worth noting, as was highlighted in the report, the sex difference in suicide pacts and consensual killings, which usually involve male carers killing their spouses. That raises some very important societal issues around caring for those who are vulnerable. The threshold of exhaustion needs to be assessed differently for male carers, and yet health services are predominantly staffed by women, and it is women who are undertaking assessments with a view to respite care or enhanced support. It may be that we are not appropriate to assess male carers. Such provocation of men needs to be considered. In other jurisdictions, it seems that the concept of force majeure in the medical context has developed in a way that would be incompatible with English law on murder. It is open to variable interpretation, including the level of knowledge and skills of the doctor, if it is a physician who deliberately ends life.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07030154000155"></a>The Criminal Law Revision Committee recommendations on reform of 1976 made no reference to the state of mind of the victim. Indeed, one is left after the victim&#146;s death only with the perception of others of that victim&#146;s state of mind, yet such proxy assessments with hindsight are not accurate and are often skewed by the person&#146;s own emotional distress, particularly if they were close to the person who died. Pressures, real or perceived, can coerce a person to feel that their life is of no value. Only too often that changes when good care is given in a way that enhances dignity. The vulnerable emotional state of the person who is frightened, in despair and possibly distorted by undiagnosed depression, which occurs in almost one third of those with serious life-threatening illness, should not be underestimated.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07030154000239"></a>&#147;It was said that our suggestion would not prevent suffering but would cause suffering, since the weak and the handicapped would receive less effective protection from the law than the fit and well because the basis of the suggested new offence would rest upon the defendant&#146;s evaluation of the condition of the victim. That evaluation might be made in ignorance of what medicine could do for the sufferer&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07030154000157"></a>I remind noble Lords that Dr Cox, whose actions were publicised as a mercy killing, was convicted of attempted murder. He was seriously admonished by the General Medical Council for failing to take advice from colleagues who knew far more about pain control and who would have been able to offer constructive clinical advice in how to relieve the overwhelming distress of the patient.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07030154000158"></a>That highlighted the problem of the doctor who works for far too long in the belief in his or her own competence across a broad range of areas. Another danger is the doctor, nurse or other carer who is tired, burnt out or simply a little lazy, and who perhaps dislikes the patient and finds caring for them taxing. It is all too easy to abandon efforts at diagnosing the true roots of distress and working hard to find resolution through meticulous attention to detail. Subtle secondary financial pressures are also felt by clinicians, and we know from the Dutch evidence how financial factors can subtly influence the thinking of some when it comes to end-of-life decision-making. The commission&#146;s learned report points out the complexity of the subject of so-called mercy killing and that it is integrally linked to the debates around assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. They felt that views they had received on mercy killing as a partial defence were potentially one-sided, since their original consultation had not asked about this.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07030154000159"></a>The limits on the proposed reformulation of the criteria for diminished responsibility in the light of the evidence from the Royal College of Psychiatrists are to be welcomed. When tragic situations arise and lead to so-called mercy killing, all will argue for compassionate reasons, whether in defence of the perpetrator or from the standpoint that the current law protects the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07030154000160"></a>The final recommendation at part 7 is that the law should remain unchanged, pending a public consultation. I hope that any such consultation will be extensive and in-depth and will include those with expertise from all sides of the arguments. The complexities and ramifications of such changes in the law are far beyond the decisions and conclusions reached through simply conducting focus groups or population polls. The discretionary sentence, as my noble friend Lord Bledisloe suggested, may enable considerations of a partial defence of mercy killing, or whatever else it is called, to be looked at, devoid of such current pressures.</p>

But its broad conclusions seem so utterly logical that it is hard to imagine any valid reason for delay in implementing them, notwithstanding doubtless valid quibbles over

The authors of the report, by painstaking analysis, have reached the same conclusion as most lay people will have arrived at intuitively; namely, that murders differ enormously in their degree of heinousness, sentences actually served should reflect this variation and it is therefore only logical to categorise homicides accordingly. However, I acknowledge that a number of noble Lords have been less than enthusiastic about the categorisation proposed.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07030154000163"></a>There is a weakness in the report. As many noble Lords have pointed out, it is absolutely through no fault of the authors, since they reveal on page 15:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07030154000240"></a>&#147;The issue of sentencing is not within our remit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000231"></a>Sentencing is therefore touched on in only five out of the 265 pages. The weakness is that confusion and ambiguity over sentencing is perhaps the chief cause of public mistrust of and cynicism about the application of the criminal law. This is by no means confined to sentences for murder and similar serious crimes.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07030154000164"></a>Well over 10 years ago Mr Michael Howard, then Home Secretary, made a clarion call for &#147;honesty in sentencing&#148;. Unfortunately he did not follow it up, since well over a year later those sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment for an intermediate offence still found themselves spending 50 per cent longer behind bars than someone else sentenced to four years for a similar offence, as the first sentence attracted one-third remission and the second 50 per cent remission.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07030154000165"></a>Moving on to 2004, Mr David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary, declared the Government&#146;s intention to,</p>
<ul><a name="07030154000245"></a>&#147;put sense back into sentencing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030154000232"></a>That was a characteristic new Labour soundbite&#151;it sounded good initially but turned out to mean something very different because, by that time, primarily owing to prison overcrowding, effective remission on shorter sentences could amount to 75 per cent or, in some cases, more than 75 per cent of a sentence. Of course the public were reassuringly told that these people were out only on licence and could be recalled at any time. But, rightly or wrongly, the public tend not to be impressed. Perhaps in an ideal world they would be impressed but we do not live in an ideal world.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07030154000166"></a>Nowhere is that ambiguity and confusion more marked than in the case of so-called life sentences. One day people read in the press that a murderer has been sentenced to life imprisonment, with a judge's recommendation that he serve at least 15 years, and the next day they read that an armed bank robber, who did not fire his gun and who physically harmed no one, has been sentenced to 20 years. I would bet heavily that at least 90 per cent of the public&#151;probably 95 per cent&#151;imagine that the bank robber will spend one-third longer behind bars than the murderer. That causes puzzlement and resentment&#151;a totally unsatisfactory and unhealthy state of affairs&#151;whereas, in truth, the outcome is almost the reverse. Assuming that the policy of 50 per cent remission persists, the murderer will spend 50 per cent longer behind bars than the bank robber.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07030154000167"></a>To restore public confidence, surely the ratio of what we might call gross to net sentences for all offences should be aligned, with one standard rate of  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1714"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1714</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remission applying across the board. The whole concept of a life sentence has been devalued for many decades now. Most people are well aware that it very rarely means life&#151;nor should it. Except in extremely rare cases, there should always be some light at the end of the tunnel, even if the end of the tunnel takes 30, 40, 50 or 60 years to reach and even if actuarially the chances of reaching the end of the tunnel are slender.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07030154000168"></a>Might it not be worth while examining the system that applies in some American states, where for very serious offences, including murder, judges can sentence a convicted person to, say, 25 to 99 years or 42 to99 years, the figure of 99 being a symbolic reflection of the gravity of the offence rather than a realistic projection of the time to be served. Adapted for English conditions, bearing in mind the absolute desirability of standardising remission procedures across the board so as not to confuse or alienate the public and to achieve Michael Howard's goal of honesty in sentencing, that would mean that instead of imposing a life sentence with a 15-year minimum recommendation, a sentence of30 to 99 years would be imposed, or 30 to 75 or 40 to 100&#151;there is no need to follow the American system slavishly. For the worst type of murder, instead of life with a 30-year minimum recommendation, one would impose a sentence of 60 to 100 or 60 to 120 years.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07030154000169"></a>For mercy killing, in complete contrast, the appropriate sentence might be two to seven years, with the expectation that a convicted person would be out in 12 months. The seven years would be symbolic, reflecting the fact that someone had died and not in the expectation that seven years would ever actually be served. The outcome for the prisoner would be exactly the same&#151;indeed, for a mercy killer it would be better in that he would be on licence for a much shorter period. What would alter would be public and media reaction to justice more clearly being seen to be done. This would surely be overwhelmingly favourable. I hope that the Government might at least consider whether proposals along those lines have any merit.</p>

I am emboldened to do so because I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, was anxious that someone with experience of how the law operates in Scotland should contribute to the debate that he has initiated. I do so against that background. </p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07030154000171"></a>The problem to which he has drawn attention exists in Scotland as well because the mandatory life sentence operates there in a very similar way to that in England and Wales. However, the problem is less acute. I shall explain briefly why that is so. It is worth recalling, as a matter of history, that the concept of diminished responsibility was developed by Scottish judges many years ago in the time of the mandatory death sentence, but as matters are today, the reason why the problem is less acute lies in the definition of the second limb of the definition of murder to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, drew attention in his speech. While the first limb requires proof of intention to kill, the second limb is defined to a  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1715"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1715</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Scottish jury as requiring proof that the act of the accused was of such wicked recklessness that he did not care whether the victim lived or died. That is much stronger than the current definition in English law.</p>

<a name="70301-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07030154000172"></a>In practice, the question of whether the sentence will be the mandatory life sentence or a discretionary sentence is to a greater degree in the hands of the jury, because they have greater discretion in evaluating where the border lies in the act of the accused. Having prosecuted many murder cases in my time at the Bar, I know that it is difficult to prove an intention to kill. However, in many cases a murder conviction was appropriate because the second limb applied. I do not wish to detract in any way from the many speeches that have been made about the need for reform of the sentence, but if the Minister says that it would be going too far, I would respectfully suggest that there is a great deal to be said for looking very hard at the second limb, no doubt with the benefit of the investigation into how the law has been operating over 15 years, to which the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, referred.</p>

I wish it had contained a draft Bill, so that some of the controversial issues in its recommendations could be before us in a more concrete form. There is a more fundamental flaw, to which noble Lords have referred and for which the Law Commission cannot in any way be criticised. The terms of reference contain the political imperative that the recommendations take account of the continuing existence of the mandatory life sentence for murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07030154000174"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and the noble Lord, Lord Monson, have rightly called attention to the fact that circumstances are infinitely variable, from mercy killing, killing on the spur of the moment, and cold-blooded and planned killing. Methods of killing vary: the fundamental cause of a death may be poison, a shooting, a knife, a punch or even a push. Victims vary. There is a difference between a gangland killing and the killing of a small child or baby. All these variable factors should be before a judge who can come to a balanced decision as to what the sentence should be in a particular case. I would respectfully suggest that it is impossible for Parliament to decide in advance what an appropriate sentence is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07030154000176"></a>The political imperative has forced the Law Commission into constructing this ladder, promulgating two degrees of murder as the first and second rungs, with manslaughter as the third rung. Immediately, this demands, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, pointed out, the drawing of boundary lines, mainly by focusing on the concept of intention and  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1716"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1716</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the use of the partial defences of provocation and diminished responsibility. These proposals in no way simplify the law; they will not lead to less frequent or shorter trials. If anything, they will add complexity to the task of a jury trying a case of culpable homicide.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07030154000177"></a>The structure recommended by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and Professor Terence Morris in their study, <I>With Malice Aforethought</I>, proposed that there should be a single homicide offence. They recognised, as the Law Commission itself said, that this was not within the terms of reference. The Law Commission rejected it in any event, on the basis that a hierarchical structure makes it possible to provide different sentencing possibilities for each crime and allows the jury, rather than the judge, to determine the gravity of the offence in post-sentencing procedures. By splitting it up into different levels, with the jury deciding what is the appropriate level, it is the jury that is making at least a broad categorisation of the offence. That is quite a good argument. It would have more force if we had special verdicts used more often in our courts that actually indicated how the jury had come to its conclusion, but it is very rare that judge will allow a special verdict that will say that a decision of manslaughter was made on the basis of provocation as opposed to diminished responsibility, and so on.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07030154000178"></a>If mandatory sentences, coupled with the division into degrees proposed in the report, are brought into effect, there has to be amelioration. That then requires the perpetuation of the partial defences, which I regard, from years of practice, as being highly unsatisfactory. Provocation and diminished responsibility are defences that are sometimes run singly, sometimes conjointly. For example, as the Law Commission described it in 2004, in mercy killings there is frequently that &#147;benign conspiracy&#148; whereby the prosecution, the defence, the judge and everyone collaborates in describing a mercy killing as due to provocation caused by the circumstances in which the individual found himself or to diminished responsibility, to reduce the offence to manslaughter and consequently lead to a lesser sentence.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07030154000179"></a>These partial defences are complex. Provocation in particular is an extremely complex area; you have to show that the defendant has himself lost control, and that a reasonable person of like age and background would have lost control. That gives rise to the issue of who is the reasonable person. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, referred to the differing judgments that go one way or the other in this field. I recall the case of Luc Thiet Thuan in 1997, before the Privy Council when I appeared for the appellant, where the council decided that no account should be taken of the fact that the appellant had suffered from a congenital brain defect. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, dissented from that Privy Council judgment. The Court of Appeal for England and Wales followed the noble and learned Lord, as did the House of Lords, in the case of Morgan Smith. Last year nine judges sat in the Privy Council in HM Attorney General for Jersey v Holley, and they held that Smith was erroneous. On the issue of who is the reasonable man there is currently a great deal of conflict. The recommendations of the Law Commission do not help to resolve the problem; they simply do not deal with it in any satisfactory way.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1717"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07030154000180"></a>There is another problem: should the judge leave provocation to the jury, even if the defence does not rely on it? The Law Commission recommended in its report, published in December 2006, that the court should revert to the practice prior to 1957 where the judge filters out speculative and wholly unmeritorious claims subject to an appeal. However, that ignores the judgment as recently as last July in the Judicial Committee of this House in the case of Coutts, where the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, gave an excellent exposition of where the public interest lies, to the effect that the question of provocation should be left by the judge to the jury, even though the defence does not rely on it in an appropriate case. He emphasised the importance and fairness of that in having a just trial.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07030154000181"></a>The other problem that arises with these partial defences is that in some instances the Crown realises that there are strong grounds for provocation or diminished responsibility. So, if there are degrees of murder, rather than allow a jury to determine what are essentially mitigating factors that could well affect the sentence, it might well bring a charge of second-degree murder in which, under these proposals, such a finding would be irrelevant. That would be highly unfortunate for the defendant and perhaps for the victim&#146;s family, which would be deprived of a possible verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. The use of provocation and diminished responsibility to ameliorate the effect of these proposals has not been properly considered.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07030154000182"></a>Diminished responsibility is another difficult area. I was interested in the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. I recall one case in which eight psychiatrists and psychologists were called to give varying opinions about a person&#146;s state of mind. There was a trial; there was an appeal on the grounds that a psychiatrist had changed his opinion; there was a second trial; and the matter went on to further appeals. As I understand it, the defendant has been in Broadmoor under an executive decision and is now about to be released into the community. There can be such a degree of difference between medical experts on this issue.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07030154000183"></a>Diminished responsibility and provocation would not be necessary as partial defences if we did not have the mandatory sentence distorting the criminal law of murder. It is quite wrong to hold that under these proposals provocation could reduce first-degree murder to second-degree murder, but should not operate to reduce second-degree murder to manslaughter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07030154000184"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said, there is a great deal of material in this report.

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07030154000186"></a>As noble Lords will have expected, the debate has been of a very high quality; and one of its distinguishing characteristics was that not only were the legal contributions compelling but so were the contributions made by noble Lords who do not have legal qualifications. I was particularly struck by the speeches of the noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy and Lady Finlay of Llandaff, on the topics of diminished responsibility and mercy killing. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, rightly remained us of the importance of honesty in sentencing and of what a distance we still have to travel to achieve that. I thought we were extremely lucky to have the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, here. Many years ago, she sat on the Nathan commission, which recommended the replacement of mandatory life sentences with a system of discretionary sentencing.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07030154000187"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and the noble Lord, Lord Dear, reminded us of the testing circumstances in which the uniformed services, which are armed, have to comply with a law of murder that sometimes leaves them in impossible circumstances. One of the gaps in what has otherwise been an excellent report by the Law Commission is this failure to address that issue. The Minister has undertaken to consult on the Law Commission&#146;s report; and I am sure that she will have found that the debate this afternoon has made a contribution to the questions that will be posed. I hope that she will have taken particular note of the speeches of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and will ask some apposite questions in that context.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07030154000188"></a>One of the characteristics of the debate is that it has been dominated by sentencing, which was not addressed in the report. We know from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, why sentencing was not included. It was not included simply because it was not part of the terms of reference of the Law Commission. I find that strange, because when one considers any crime, but particularly murder, the credibility of the sentencing system is as important as the conformity of the law with people&#146;s moral standards. The two march together; and I submit that you cannot reasonably address the one without the other.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07030154000189"></a>The Law Commission has produced a very thoughtful report on the law. Curiously, one of the consequences of its proposals, if they are accepted by the Government and appear in a Bill, is that more people will be convicted of murder than before. This is because the offence of reckless manslaughter will be moved up from the manslaughter category to the category of second degree murder. That category, it has been assumed by the Law Commission, will be subject to a discretionary sentencing system and not a mandatory sentencing system.</p>

To some extent, one sees that thinking reflected in the Law Commission&#146;s definition of first degree murder; because, in addition to an intention to kill, the intention to commit serious harm is now qualified by the requirement that the accused should be reckless as to

In a sense, therefore, the Law Commission is moving towards the Scottish situation.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07030154000191"></a>There are important criticisms to make of mandatory life sentences that are unique to the mandatory life sentence. One, to which many of your Lordships drew our attention, is the way in which the fact of a mandatory life sentence distorts the approaches of juries to assessing the evidence and often leads to acquittals in circumstances where that would otherwise be inappropriate. The other distinct category of mandatory life sentence is that, however short a sentence is served, at the end of the day, when you leave prison you are subject to a licence for the rest of your life. That is highly undesirable for many offences.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07030154000192"></a>However, surely the real issue here is wider than this; because even if it is right to replace the mandatory life sentence with the system recommended by the Nathan committee, we are still faced with the problem, highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Monson&#151;namely that everybody knows that the sentence that is handed down by the court often bears little relation to the amount of time the individual spends in prison. That undermines the whole credibility of the sentencing system. Until we address that problem, the general public will not have faith in our system of criminal law. If we move to discretionary sentencing, we still have to take this further step of being honest about sentencing; that sentences handed down by judges are the sentences that are served by the person who has been convicted. That is, in a sense, the dog that did not bark in this report; but it is the dog that ought to have barked.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07030154000193"></a>I for one would be very reluctant to move down the road of a Bill seeking to change the law of murder along the lines of the Law Commission report without at the same time having a set of rules about sentencing which were truly credible in the eyes of the general public. In my view these two matters run together and I hope that is the message that the Government will take away.</p>

I think we have had a glittering array of talent. It is rare indeed to see so many noble Lords with legal backgrounds, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, gallant Lords, scientific Lords, musical Lords almost from the Liberal Democrat Benches, singing so clearly in relation to this matter. I join the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, not only in congratulating noble Lords but in rejoicing in having the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, with us because I, too, think that she was wrong to say that she does not have an expertise, having joined that Nathan committee with such distinction.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07030154000195"></a>I am however a little perplexed as to where the party of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, actually sits. I do not understand whether he is saying that he would get rid of the mandatory life sentence. I see him shaking his head. No, he is not saying that. And I do  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1720"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1720</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not understand whether he is suggesting that the current system of sentencing should no longer have remission or parole or licence periods after sentence and that we should simply have a sentence of imprisonment. I am sure that he will elucidate on that in later debates, but I am somewhat perplexed about his party&#146;s position on this. But as I now experience that perplexity in so many policy issues, I should perhaps become a little more accustomed to it.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07030154000196"></a>It is a matter of great celebration that we are looking at the Government&#146;s review of the laws of homicide because this is the first proper review in this area for more than half a century, and it is important that at all stages we debate it very thoroughly indeed. I can assure your Lordships that all the comments made during this debate will be taken into account and fed directly into the review of the Law Commission&#146;s contributions. The impetus for this review was the concern with the way in which the law work, in particular in domestic homicide cases. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, asked for an explanation of why the review is as limited as it is and it is incumbent on me to answer that. Your Lordships will remember that when we first looked at domestic homicide, there were huge difficulties; for example, concerns that it may be too easy for a jealous partner to use the partial defence of provocation to escape a murder conviction through blaming the victim&#146;s alleged infidelity. Unfaithfulness should not be an excuse for murder.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07030154000197"></a>We therefore asked the Law Commission to look at partial defences. In its 2003 report on partial defences, it concluded that the law of murder was in a mess. In response, the then Home Secretary invited the Law Commission to undertake the first part of a wide-ranging two-stage review of the law of homicide. The Law Commission&#146;s report is the conclusion of the first part of that process. The Government are very grateful to the Law Commission for its work in producing the detailed and considered report on proposals for reform.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07030154000198"></a>We are particularly pleased that the commission has consulted so widely in drawing up these proposals. It has drawn together views from a wide range of interested parties, and we will seek to build on this work in the next stages of the review, which will now be taken forward by the Home Office. When my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon questioned the commission&#146;s comment about judges not welcoming a single offence, I believe that it may be referring to the judges of today who may have expressed that view. In doing this work, we must ensure that any reform leaves us with practical laws that provide justice for victims, properly punish offenders and command confidence from the public.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07030154000199"></a>Clearly, many difficult issues arise in looking at the law of murder which raise complex moral and legal questions. But the review of homicide must not become a political battleground. We all come to this with a desire to get the law right. So today&#146;s debate is a very welcome opportunity for me to explain the Government&#146;s reasons for reviewing the law and why we have set the parameters for the review that we have.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1721"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07030154000200"></a>In particular, I turn to the direct question that was asked to me by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. The Law Commission has identified problems with the law of murder and potential solutions to them. We need to be able to take these forward without the risk of being sent off track by other issues. The other issues that we have discussed are weighty, involving moral and legal minefields, but the key problems with the existing law lie elsewhere. I know that there are many who would want us to go into that contentious area, including the mandatory life penalty for murder, euthanasia, suicide and abortion. But we believe that the difficulties of law are such that we should concentrate on those.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07030154000201"></a>The Government believe that the mandatory life penalty for murder is an essential part of giving the public confidence in the criminal justice system, and the life sentence is of course a very important part of that. The Government are of the view that the mandatory life penalty should not be abolished. I recognise that that view is not universally held and, indeed, not a view that was expressed by any noble Lord in this debate. But we are proposing an important change and I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, for his exposition of Scottish law and the helpful contribution that that may make.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07030154000202"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, will of course recall that Parliament very recently had the opportunity to consider whether the mandatory life penalty for murder should be abolished when he laid an amendment to that effect during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This House then supported the retention of the mandatory penalty. It also supported the introduction of the principles for tariff setting for murder which were introduced to ensure confidence in the criminal justice system and consistency of sentencing. Therefore, what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said was right. It reminded us of what came out of that Act by virtue of the guidelines that can be set by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Given Parliament&#146;s recent support for the retention of the mandatory penalty and the principles for tariff setting, it was only sensible that the review of murder should take that reality into account.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07030154000203"></a>Furthermore, and equally important, I do not believe that the review of the law of murder has been unduly restricted by the terms of reference that were set for the Law Commission. Indeed, it disagreed with those who said that its proposals for a new structure would have been different had it been reviewing the mandatory penalty. For that reason, I cannot accept the proposition that the root of the problems with the law of murder is the mandatory life penalty.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07030154000204"></a>One key problem that the Law Commission identified with the present law is the mismatch between a general view of what murder means and the legal definition. This means that juries may convict killers of manslaughter rather than murder where there was no intention to kill the victim, only an intention to do serious harm, which is of course a sufficient intent for a murder conviction. That must be partly because the label of murder does not seem appropriate in all the circumstances, many of which we have discussed today.</p>

The Minister says that that has motivated Parliament in the past to adhere to the continuance of the mandatory life sentence. I am bearing in mind that lay people often consider that the trouble is that a &#147;life sentence&#148; is perceived not to be &#147;life&#148;. That is partly why our debate is so contrived and confined. Does the Minister agree that a real, in-depth understanding of the public&#146;s feelings about the appropriateness of the sentence fitting the crime would not necessarily lead to an asseveration of the view that Parliament reiterated?</p>

No set provision has been made on what further consultation may take place or its nature. We believe that we need to concentrate on trying to find a legal solution to some of the clearly identified problems, which have been with us for a long time.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07030154000207"></a>I know, too, of another suggestion raised in the work undertaken by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and others: that we should have a single offence. We have had to look at that option, and it is accepted that some solutions to the problem with the law, such as creating a single offence for homicide, would necessitate the abolition of the mandatory penalty.It is true, of course, that by not reviewing the mandatory penalty that option was ruled out.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07030154000208"></a>However, while that was outside the scope of the review, the Law Commission nevertheless considered it. We agree with it that while such a proposal offers some advantages, the label of murder is so significant in our society that we should neither abandon it altogether, nor apply it to all forms of homicide. For that reason, and the other compelling ones set out by the Law Commission, we are not minded to support a single offence of homicide. I stress that the second part of the review is yet to be completed.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07030154000209"></a>Having accepted that we need more than one offence of homicide, the solutions we find for the problems with the law will be more complicated than simply abolishing the mandatory penalty. As a point of principle, we believe it is right that the most serious form of homicide retains that penalty.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07030154000210"></a>We have looked at partial defences, and it has been suggested that we should change them. They allow juries to decide whether the behaviour of the offender is in some way mitigated, so that the full force of a murder conviction is not imposed on the offender. I am glad that there has been no suggestion in this debate to abolish entirely those partial defences, because it is recognised that they provide us with an important way in which to differentiate levels of culpability.</p>

<a name="70301-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07030154000211"></a>We do not accept that the review of the law has been restricted in a way that would prevent the problems that need to be addressed being addressed. That is demonstrated by the Law Commission&#146;s report, which  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1723"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1723</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>offers many interesting ideas for improving the law. It is also useful to consider how the Law Commission proposed new structure would affect some of the hard cases which raise the most difficult questions about the appropriateness of mandatory life sentences.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70301-0013.htm"/>


<a name="70301-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07030154000212"></a>Many noble Lords raised today the appropriateness of the mandatory penalty for those who kill terminally ill loved ones. The Law Commission has proposed that the definition of the partial defence of diminished responsibility should be expanded so that it more easily accommodates severely depressed carers who kill, thus mitigating the problem. Although this does not address head-on the question of whether those who kill in such circumstances but are of sound mind should ever not be convicted of the most serious offence of homicide, we have consistently said that this is a matter of conscience and needs separate consideration. However, I was very grateful for the comments of the noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy and Lady Finlay, who both identified some quite complex issues, which we need to look at in relation to diagnosis and the appropriate role for palliative care. Can we always be sure that the mercy killing really has that attached to it? There may be other reasons. I found those comments enormously valuable.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07030154000213"></a>We have looked at issues recently in this House, and will no doubt do so again. I do not see the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, in his place, but he has the consistency and persistency of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, so I am confident that the issue will not go away.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07030154000214"></a>Another type of case where the mandatory penalty may seem inappropriate is the case of a victim of domestic violence who finally kills their abuser out of desperation. That is not a case that has been mentioned much this afternoon, but can I say how important I believe it is? We have a dreadful situation in this country at the moment in relation to domestic violence, whereby one in four women may be subject to it at some stage in their lives. We must deal with those issues, not only with a degree of compassion but with acuity too. Here again, the Law Commission offers some interesting ways to allow such killers to be convicted of an offence which does not carry the mandatory penalty, but at the same time can reflect the intentional nature of the killing.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07030154000215"></a>I was also grateful for the very carefully crafted speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. The plight of the soldiers and police officers who discharge on our behalf some of the most dangerous and difficult duties should, rightly, excite our attention&#151;particularly when such individuals kill in the line of duty but in doing so may have overreacted to a threat of violence or had to make a decision in a split second as to how to respond. Here the Law Commission's reform of provocation to encompass excessive use of force in self-defence could see such situations being brought out of the scope of the mandatory penalty.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07030154000216"></a>In conclusion, this has been an incredibly useful and wide-ranging debate and has raised many concerns to which I am sure we will return as the review progresses. I recognise that many of those who have spoken today would like us to broaden the scope  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1724"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1724</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the review to look at the continued existence of the mandatory life sentence for the most serious forms of homicide and at other difficult moral questions associated with homicide, but we believe that to do so would make for an unwieldy review. There are some genuine difficulties with the way in which the current homicide laws work which we believe can be addressed within the parameters of this review. To bring into the review other difficult and controversial areas risks preventing us being able to make progress with reform in areas where we need to see change.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07030154000217"></a>The proposed Law Commission&#146;s reforms would address many of the concerns that have been raised today about the impact of the mandatory life penalty; they would address a much broader range of issues, too. I want to build, if we can, on consensus in taking this review forward. For reforming laws as key as homicide, it is right that we have that consensus. I believe that we can do that, producing viable proposals for reform that will address the key problems without getting into highly controversial areas such as the mandatory life penalty.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07030154000218"></a>Finally, in terms of the next steps for this review, we are considering whether to adopt the Law Commission&#146;s proposals. As I have said, we see a lot of merit in them, but because this is such a sensitive area, we also want to consult widely on how to reform the law. I am sure that the consensual way in which we have always worked in this House will greatly assist us in that regard.</p>

It will, I hope, be obvious to the commission that the reason was that although I had 15 minutes in which to speak, which was more than anyone else, I ran out of time. I spent too much time on the mandatory sentence about which, it must be obvious, I feel strongly. But my deficiencies in that respect have been amply made good by others who have spoken in the debate.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07030154000220"></a>I particularly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and my noble friend Lady Murphy that a person who kills without intent to kill but only to cause serious harm should not be guilty of second-degree murder, as is proposed, but should be guilty only of manslaughter. I particularly agree that if a partial defence is upheld, it should result in a verdict of manslaughter, not second-degree murder.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07030154000221"></a>I agree with my noble friends Lady Darcy de Knayth and Lord Bledisloe and my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf that the problem since the HomicideAct 1957 has been the attempt to draw fine lines and create new categories. That has not worked, yet that is what the Law Commission is now recommending. Not only would there be a fine line between murder and manslaughter, which is unavoidable, but a fine line between first and second-degree murder would add to the difficulties of juries and create appeals to the Court of Appeal on technical points. I cannot, I am afraid, support having two degrees of murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07030154000222"></a>I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, that if there is to be legislation, it should be considered by a Select Committee of this House. Murder is too important a subject to be considered only by the lawyers, as it has been, and by civil servants, as it is about to be. It is a subject on which the public are involved, not only in respect of mercy killing but on all the other matters we have been discussing this afternoon.</p>

But like the noble Baroness, I am not quite sure whether he went further than that in condemning the mandatory sentence as such. As the noble Baroness has said, there has been a glittering array of speakers this afternoon; together they have made a very powerful case for the abolition of the mandatory sentence. Nobody has supported it. I hope, now, that the Government will take action, not only on the many recommendations in many reports, but on this debate.

On 1 January 2006, a new joint department was established as a department of the House of Commons on an interim basis. The aim of the new department is to address modern IT needs and to allow improvements in IT services to the two Houses and to individual Members. The Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology service&#151;PICT for short&#151;has House of Lords staff loaned to the House of Commons on a time-limited basis. When the House Committee agreed this arrangement in 2005, it emphasised that the temporary arrangement was only acceptable in the short term.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07030162000007"></a>The principle of a fully joint department for ICT has been supported by the House Committee and the House of Commons Commission. One reason forthe creation of a joint ICT department is to improve the management of computer services to Members of both Houses, and to deliver a more efficient service.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07030162000008"></a>Staff representatives in both Houses have been consulted fully. A principal aim of this short Bill is to protect staff rights. For example, in relation to the pay, conditions and pensions of staff in joint departments, Clause 3(2) makes provision similar to that in the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978. Clause 4 and the schedule will ensure that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006&#151;TUPE&#151;will apply to transfers of staff between the two Houses and a joint department. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the schedule are concerned with transfers that occur when functions are allocated to a joint department&#151;for instance, when that department is first set up. Paragraphs 5 and 6 deal with the eventuality that functions being exercised by a joint department might be allocated elsewhere&#151;for instance, to one or both Houses&#151;or might even cease to be exercised at all. In all those cases, the allocation of functions which leads to staff being transferred into or out of a joint department, from or to one or the other House, will be treated as the transfer of an undertaking, so that TUPE will apply to the transfer of the staff concerned.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07030162000009"></a>Most other aspects of staff representatives&#146; relations with management are covered by non-statutory Whitley Committee arrangements, as has been customary in the Civil Service. Those arrangements are well established in both Houses and the corporate officers are committed to agreeing a suitable extension of the Whitley system to cover a joint department.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07030162000010"></a>Bills relating to the internal administration of Parliament are rare. The most recent precedent is the Parliamentary Corporate Bodies Act 1992. Because of the difficulty in finding parliamentary time, the Bill has been drafted in a way that is not limited to IT but which will allow further joint departments to be developed should the two Houses agree. Neither House has any such plans for a further joint department at present. Clause 2(3) provides the safeguard that when taking any significant decisions on a joint department, the corporate officers may act only with the approval of the House of Commons Commission and of the House of Lords on a recommendation of the House Committee. The House Committee was keen for the new interim department to be set up on a permanent joint basis as soon as possible. To that end, all the provisions of the Bill will come into force on Royal Assent.</p>

I suspect that this may be the only time this month that we have a debate on a proposal affecting Parliament that attracts so few speakers. It may be the only debate on the future structure of Parliament in which I carry the noble Lord, Lord McNally, with me, but I live in hope. I have an interest in the Bill from the perspective of the problem it addresses and the general provision that it introduces. I have only two points that I wish to raise, one concerning each aspect of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07030162000014"></a>I fully appreciate why the Bill is necessary. It is only in the past few years that Parliament has begun to get its act together on its information and communication technology. In the early 1990s, it was essentially falling behind, not helped by the Information Committee in the other place rejecting a recommendation for central provision. This was changed only at the end of the decade and central provision actually introduced after the 2001 election. Thanks to the Cummins report in 2004, the need for a more unified management structure in the provision of ICT was grasped. The problem in getting some coherence in the delivery of ICT has been not only the separate structures of the two Houses but also the complex management structure of the other place. Cummins provided the spur for the creation of a single joint-House service and we now have, as the noble Baroness said, the Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology&#151;PICT&#151;service, brought into being at the beginning of last year. I do not propose to go into detail because the background and the need for a joint service are provided in a very good article by Richard Ware, PICT's director of resources, in volume 24 of the<I> Table</I> last year.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07030162000015"></a>The case for a joint service is, I think, clear and compelling. As the noble Baroness said, PICT was created on a temporary basis, pending legislation. The Bill will create the basis for it being a permanent body. As she said, it is important that those serving Parliament through a joint department enjoy the same employment rights as those serving each House. I think that there is agreement on all sides that this provision, embodied in Clauses 3, 4 and 5, is right and necessary.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07030162000016"></a>I want to take this opportunity to encourage PICT to continue to make up for lost time. There is much that still needs to be done. The Parliament website has been overhauled but there is still much to do. We need to exploit new technology to ensure that people are aware of what we do in both Houses as well as utilise it for greater involvement by people who have knowledge and views useful to both Houses. Some committees have experimented with online consultation. We need to build on this and look at novel ways of harnessing technology. There is no reason why we should not be ahead of the game, rather than having to play catch-up.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07030162000017"></a>I turn to the general provisions of the Bill, embodied in Clauses 1 and 2. The Bill is brought in because of the creation of PICT but, as the noble Baroness has explained, it can be utilised in the future to create other joint departments. There is already substantial co-operation between the Houses on a range of matters, necessarily so. There may well be  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1728"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occasions in the future where a joint department may be appropriate. The letter from the Clerks of the two Houses says that,</p>
<ul><a name="07030162000188"></a>&#147;neither House has any such plans as present&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000168"></a>but I accept that it is prudent to make provision now.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07030162000018"></a>Given this general provision, it is important that safeguards are written into the Bill. I therefore very much welcome Clause 2(3), which ensures that approval is sought from each House. The provision is somewhat asymmetrical, in that the approval of the other place is given through the House of Commons Commission, whereas here it is given by the House on the recommendation of the House Committee. I am not quite sure why the approval of the other place is not given by the House itself, but that is more appropriately a matter for Members of the other place. I think that the arrangements for the approval of this House are entirely appropriate.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07030162000019"></a>Accountability is provided in that the head of a joint department is accountable to the corporate officer of each House. I assume that to be the case from the wording of the Bill. Once a joint department is in place, I am not quite sure what will happen in the event of a disagreement between the corporate officers. That might merit some reflection. My principal point, though, concerns what happens beyond formal accountability to the corporate officers. It is very important that a joint department reports regularly to both Houses on what it is doing. There is the danger that a joint department may become a little detached. There needs to be not only formal reporting to the corporate officers but a wider reporting to both Houses, and a recognition that the joint department exists to help the Members of both Houses in fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07030162000020"></a>Indeed, there needs to be a responsibility not only to report but to listen and take account of concerns. I appreciate that any concerns may be raised via the corporate officers. However, we should give some thought on how to ensure that a joint department is responsive and recognises its responsibility to Members. We may also need to give some consideration as to how to ensure that those employed in a joint department, especially those recruited from outside Parliament, are trained in the nature and responsibilities of both Houses. They need to utilise their expertise in a very particular environment and it is important that they are sensitive to it.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07030162000021"></a>Those are the only points I wished to make. I appreciate the need for the measure but I felt that it merited at least some comment.</p>

Dare I suggest that one day we might even have joint catering in this building? Noble Lords can see that I am already gearing up to be in a radical frame of mind in 10 days&#146; time.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07030162000024"></a>The only warning that I offer on how joint departments are managed is that it is important to get the right ethos in the staff. By that I mean that priority should not automatically be given to the House of Commons, with a joint department seeing the House of Lords as a secondary responsibility. But that apart, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, said, the Bill gives us a chance to get ahead of the game in using new technologies both in the service of Members and communicating with the outside world. It gives us a very welcome opportunity to keep open the prospect of having other joint departments.</p>

Now, for a few minutes, is such a time and the working machinery of this great Parliament sticks up a little into the light from the depths in which it is usually shrouded.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="07030162000026"></a>Originally, of course, Parliament was all one and I suppose that it was run by the Clerk of the Parliaments. The name of the office is still with us, but for many centuries this House has acquiesced in the Commons having their own Clerk&#151;that must have been a revolution in its day&#151;and an increasingly separate organisation.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="07030162000027"></a>Today we are reversing that process just a little and providing for the unification of services answerable to both Houses. It is a sensible thing to do, but it would be surprising if there were not some hesitation about how far the process might go. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, has already demonstrated that. Both Houses pride themselves on their individual character and position and the Bill is widely drawn. It is true that any department can be made joint by the Clerks with the agreement of the House of Commons Commission on the one hand and of the whole House of Lords on the other. Like my noble friend Lord Norton, I am not sure of the reason for that distinction, but as presented in the Bill it is asymmetrical.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07030162000028"></a>It is true that some services are already joint. Security is inevitably indivisible. The head of security and his staff operate for both Houses. The works and estate services are common to both. The Parliamentary Archives are now jointly run; the exhibition held recently showed us that. The new visitor facilities&#151;we have looked forward to them for some time&#151;are to be joint. There is already the joint service for Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology. It is this latter alone which is presently proposed to be under the joint command structure in the Bill. It is right that it should be and I support that.</p>

<a name="70301-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07030162000029"></a>What about the other services? Neatness would suggest sometimes that existing joint services should be brought under the same umbrella. However, I have never been one for disturbing arrangements which  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1730"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 1730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work well simply for the sake of neatness. I do not think that the rearrangements always deliver what is promised. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, has suggested that some other services might be made joint. His radical suggestion was the Refreshment Departments. Other people speak of the Libraries being blended, particularly when the Law Lords have departed and that aspect of our Library becomes more separate. I should be against either of those services being amalgamated. I see no advantage in size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07030162000030"></a>The Lord President and everyone else will know that the House will watch these arrangements carefully and will be prepared to defend its ground. There will be arguments about efficiency, which in other circles is often promised and less often delivered when amalgamations take place. The differing character of the two Houses is precious to the Members of both Houses. I speak of the present character of this House, realising that in the next two weeks we shall be discussing the possibility of a different character for it&#151;one much closer potentially to that of the Commons. But even if the second House were to be fully elected, I believe that it would want to retain its separate identity. Indeed, I believe that it would fight to exert its independence and to gain the equality that the legitimacy of election would confer, and it would be right to do so. I do not think that that changes the point I make.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07030162000031"></a>If we go on in much the same way as we do at present, the Lords will remain conscious of its position as the junior partner to the Commons, which inevitably has more resources, more political muscle and more ambition. The Lords will need to watch its position, not only when changes in scope are proposed but in normal running when there are problems about a joint department trying to serve two masters. Of course, holy writ, as well as my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, warns us about the problem of serving two masters, but it will be present sometimes.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07030162000032"></a>We welcome the Bill. We are certainly content for the PICT function to be jointly controlled, as set out in the Bill.

We in the House of Lords will ensure that the needs of this House are guarded very jealously; the noble Lord, Lord Cope, is right that Members of this House will be watching very carefully what happens in the way that the service is delivered. On the issue of the wider safeguards, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, it is for another place to decide its process, as he indicated. It is important for this House that it is the House that makes the decision, on the recommendation of the House Committee.</p>

That has always been the case. In certain circumstances, difficulties have been resolved by one House, for example, taking responsibility for the lion&#146;s share of the funding or staff resource that is provided. That already happens with individual IT projects, where one House will have a much greater interest than the other. The principle of having a joint department, which is about the two Houses working much more closely together, is something that we will all want to see enshrined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07030162000036"></a>In terms of that being extended to other services, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is being particularly radical in raising the issue of the Refreshment Department. My experience of raising the possibility of one or two parts of our refreshment services being shared is that the idea tends to disappear into a very large black hole and never reappear. Both Houses will watch how this develops, and other possibilities for joint departments may well come up in the future. I would be a very brave woman if I were to make any suggestion about what that future might be in terms of time.</p>

Indeed, the Minister also referred to that in her Second Reading remarks about the suggestions in the various clauses. I intervened at that stage to emphasise that that was not the intention of the Bill, which is drafted in such a way that its provisions are entirely permissive and voluntary all the way through, without exception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07030162000047"></a>However, sometimes textual equivocations can arise because of the use of, for example, the word &#147;shall&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;. The difficulty is that &#147;may&#148;, as colleagues here and in the other place will understand, reduces the apparent force of the exhortatory nature of the clause, and so people prefer to remain with the stronger verb.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07030162000048"></a>I thought that it would therefore be sensible and politic to propose an amendment at this stage to give the Secretary of State the power to intervene. Under the amendment, those who wish to set up a European Union centre in public buildings, public libraries and municipal buildings would apply to the Secretary of State for a certificate, which would be a board or a plaque of some kind to be displayed in the building as an indication that the Government had given their approval to the creation of the unit. That is not to say that there would be any over-riding power exercised by the Secretary of State or the Government over this matter; setting up the centre for information would be an entirely free and voluntary decision of the local authorities and other entities. However, the fact that the plaque or board was on display would show the imprimatur of government encouragement at least. There would be no connection with any European Union institutions, which would reassure colleagues who would be worried about the involvement of the European Union and its institutions in matters that should remain entirely in the national ambit. I beg move.</p>

If it is accepted, my opposition to these amendments largely disappears, because the information put out will be balanced&#151;neither pro-European Union nor anti-European Union&#151;and so it does not much matter where it is displayed.</p>

<ul><a name="07030162000189"></a>&#147;public libraries, town halls and similar public buildings&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/12/06; col. 1771.]</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000169"></a>Will he now, in Committee, go a little further and reveal what other public buildings the Bill has in mind? Is he thinking of schools, universities, underground stations, departments of state and so on? Does he really mean any building that is funded by the public purse? Be the answer to those questions what it may, I would have thought that the best body to sanction where the information should be displayed should be the committee recommended by Amendment No. 3. In the mean time, I look forward to the noble Lord&#146;s comments.</p>

In doing so, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, for giving the Committee the chance to discuss these important issues. The Government welcome the contribution that the noble Lord continues to make to the debate on EU affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07030162000052"></a>As I stated in the House last December, the Government wholeheartedly support many activities to ensure that factual information about the European Union is freely and widely available to the people of the UK. However, we do not support the idea that public buildings should be required to provide such information; I note the comments made by the noble Lord in relation to the word &#147;shall&#148;. Nor do we wish to support provisions that might impose extra administrative or other burdens on those providing such information.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07030162000053"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendments might reduce the number of public buildings covered by these requirements. Nevertheless, the new processes that they would establish for public organisations to apply and be selected and approved by the Secretary of State would be time-consuming and costly. The Government are already supporting the European Commission&#146;s Europe Direct initiative, which has established 25 centres around the country to act as one-stop shops for public information on the EU. Many other sources, including the Government&#146;s europe.gov.uk website and the European Union&#146;s Europa website, offer a very wide range of factual information. The Government, therefore, have reservations about these proposed provisions and, in particular, whether they would be the most effective way of furthering public access to information on EU issues.</p>

I am puzzled over how they reduce, in any way, the distinctly mandatory tone of the legislation and turn it into a more permissive measure. This highlights the dangers of trying to legislate in these kinds of areas. Legislation is the law. It empowers Governments and authorities and informs the conduct and enforcement of the law in any area, and certainly in this area. Attempts to water down, which I think is what the noble Lord, in all sincerity, is trying to do, are almost certain to be hostages to fortune.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07030162000055"></a>I agree with the Minister that these amendments are unnecessary. It will be no surprise to the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, to hear me say, as I shall indicate on a later amendment, that this attempt to bring legislation into this area is a sad one. It will damage, rather than reinforce, the work of European unity and effectiveness and the creation of the modern Europe that is now developing and which I greatly welcome&#151;it may indeed yet bring extreme benefits to our people, as it has done in the past. I do not see that this amendment will help at all.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="07030162000063"></a>The amendment speaks for itself. It may not be perfect, but it is an honest attempt to see that any information put before the public should pass through both Europhile and Euro-sceptic filters, thus emerging as balanced as possible. Other noble Lords may be able to think of a better way of ensuring that only balanced and honest information about our relationship with the EU is distributed, in which case I look forward to hearing their suggestions. What is absolutely obvious is that no official information from Brussels or the Government should be distributed unless it is balanced by the Euro-sceptic view. Indeed, the committee proposed by the amendment might decide to do just that. It might decide to distribute the Brussels line on a given subject with the sceptic view alongside it. People could then ask questions, talk about it, at last have some of the national debate that the Government say they want, and make up their own minds.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07030162000064"></a>I take the example of subsidiarity. In his speech at Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07030162000184"></a>&#147;I am especially keen that the explanation of subsidiarity, for example, should be properly handled, as well as the emphasis that many policy areas remain the principal or sole preserve of the sovereign member states, which is as it should be&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/12/06; col. 1771.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000065"></a>Europhiles claim that subsidiarity ensures that the EU is given power to do things only when they can be done better by the Community acting as a whole, leaving everything else to be done by the member states. I imagine that that may be the interpretation supported by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, but I hope that he will forgive me when I say that we Euro-sceptics regard it as entirely misleading; we would regard it as entirely misleading if that meaning of subsidiarity was to form part of the information distributed under the Bill. We maintain that subsidiarity has precisely the opposite meaning and, indeed, has had the opposite effect over the years.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="07030162000066"></a>We would want the people to be told that subsidiarity has always been a deception and has done nothing to stem the steady passage of powers from the member states to the European Union. We have not deviated from this view since subsidiarity was introduced during the Maastricht negotiations of 1992. We noticed then that the clause was ambiguously worded, its first sentence making it clear that it applied only to areas that had not already been passed to the control of the EU. We felt rather sorry for poor Mr Major when he claimed subsidiarity as a great victory for national sovereignty, saying that under it some 25 per cent of the already over-burdensome EU regulation would be repealed within three years. Of course, nothing of the sort has happened.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="07030162000067"></a>To rub in the true interpretation of the subsidiarity clause, Protocol 30 was added to the next treaty&#151;the Amsterdam treaty of 1997. This states clearly that subsidiarity means maintaining the acquis communautaire&#151;or powers acquired by the Community&#151;in full. It goes

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07030162000185"></a>&#147;The Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to obtain its objectives and carry through its policies&#148;.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07030162000069"></a>We would expect any information on subsidiarity to at least contain the treaty clauses and protocolon which it is based and some examples of where it has worked. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, could&#151;if I could have his attention&#151;give us examples of areas of our national sovereignty that have been returned to us under it, and examples where a reasonable person might think that the EU should not have taken powers, leaving them to the national Parliament to decide instead. We feel that examples of both those should be put to the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07030162000070"></a>Before the noble Lord gives us those examples, I remind him of the statement made last month byMr Roman Herzog, the former German President, to the effect that 84 per cent of all German national law since 1999 has been imposed by Brussels. It may not be quite the same figure here, although it is hard to see why it should be different. Our Government refuse to answer the question of what percentage applies here, going no further than to confess that most law affecting our business now comes from Brussels, which is bad enough.</p>

<a name="70301-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07030162000071"></a>Even if we are cautious and say that some 70 per cent of all our national law is now imposed on us by the Brussels system, that should give us all pause for thought. Does that not mean that your Lordships&#146; House and the House of Commons are now 70 per cent irrelevant, if 70 per cent of our function has been usurped by Brussels? Of course, working here in these splendid surroundings, and with most Members of the other place paid rather more than they might be in real life, it is easy not to see the wood for the trees. That is where our membership of the European Union has brought us, and I would like to know what subsidiarity has done to stop it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07030162000072"></a>At Second Reading on 1 December, I briefly set down, at cols. 1778-79 of <I>Hansard</I>, some of the other basic reasons why we Euro-sceptics so dislike and fear the project of European Union, all of which we would want to form part of the information distributed under the Bill. I will not repeat them now. We hope that this Bill would give rise to open and honest debate on the innately undemocratic system of EU lawmaking, about which most people in this country are simply not aware. We hope that national debate would also be encouraged on the question of exactly what the economic costs and benefits of our EU membership really are&#151;another subject avoided by the Government like a frightened rabbit, perhaps because private independent studies put the cost of our membership at anywhere between 4 per cent and 10 per cent of GDP. No wonder the Government do not want to have to validate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="07030162000073"></a>If the Bill were already law, we would expect it to create some national awareness of how the failed EU constitution is being put in place in Brussels&#151;piecemeal, surreptitiously and illegally. That is not the sort of thing that Brussels or our Government, who are collaborating in this process by refusing to use the veto to stop it, want the British people to know about. Under this amendment, though, we could go to the proposed committee and ask it to publish the fact that articles in the existing treaties are being used to advance the constitution through the back door.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="07030162000074"></a>One of the main articles being used for that purpose is Article 308, which allows the EU to take power only,</p>
<ul><a name="07030162000190"></a>&#147;in the course of the operation of the common market&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000171"></a>Yet this clause is being used to set up the EU&#146;s fundamental rights agency in Vienna and to legalise its fundamental rights charter, a vast new human rights law justiciable in the Luxembourg court. This is the initiative, as noble Lords may remember, that Mr Keith Vaz, when Europe Minister, assured us would have no more force than the <I>Beano</I>, and which the Prime Minister assured us would never become justiciable in Luxembourg; yet the Commission has ordained that all new law must reflect the charter, and the court has declared that it is already deferring to the charter in its judgments. Thus the corrupt octopus advances. Article 308 has also been used to pass control of civil contingencies to Brussels, and even to validate a new &#8364;350 million EU propaganda campaign called &#147;Promoting Active EU Citizenship&#148;.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="07030162000075"></a>Your Lordships have considered these three abuses of Article 308 recently in Oral Questions, and there have been several Written Questions. To all these questions, the Government offer a wholly unacceptable excuse for not using the veto to prevent them. They have done it again today, in a Written Answer to my noble friend Lord Tebbit, at cols. <I>WA 310-11</I> in <I>Hansard</I>. They say that before allowing Article 308 to be used, they submit the proposal in question to the scrutiny committees of both Houses. However, those committees are powerless to prevent the Government from going ahead, especially as the Government have over-ridden their reservations 180 times in the past three years.</p>

It is true that one can find organisations, as opposed to individuals, that oppose continuing membership, but there must be others that are conditional opponents or supporters. There must be some that would be happy to remain members of the EU, if we reverted to the pre-Maastricht treaty position or if large chunks of the acquis communautaire were repealed, but which would favour leaving if our sovereignty continued to be eroded and the EU continued to poke into the nooks and crannies of our everyday lives, in the immortal words of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd of Westwell.

Poll after poll reveals this to be true. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and I agree about that. The question is how you rectify this. How do you improve the levels of knowledge?

<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="07030162000083"></a>This year, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original Treaty of Rome. Whatever one&#146;s views about specific weaknesses or strengths of the European Union, one thing is surely clear: the European Union has made an enormous contribution to the civilisation of which we are a part. I dread to think what the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet empire would have been if the European Union had not

It is almost unimaginable. We had one rather scary but thankfully brief moment right at the beginning of that process when the French and the Germans suddenly found themselves with very different views about the future of the failed state of Yugoslavia. That brief glimpse of the hard edge of European nationalism, which has not yet finally expired, was a warning.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="07030162000084"></a>We should do what we can to improve the levels of knowledge, as well as the understanding of the enormous achievement of the European Union and the issues that remain for debate, which are clearly controversial. The Bill is a good step in that direction. The amendment, however, is based on an extraordinarily odd notion that the only way in which you can achieve balance is to take the two most extreme positions you can find and pit them against each other.</p>

I have one comment to make on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord. The Government are rather concerned that it could impose a costly new bureaucratic layer between the Government and the public. That, from a party whose manifesto says no to paperwork, is quite a surprising development.</p>

That does not necessarily mean that I agree with the actual details of the proposals. I am grateful to other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate and to the Minister for her contribution, which although brief was a very soundly enunciated commitment to the membership of the European Union, which this Government have always stated, from the Prime Minister downwards. That is appreciated. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, made some very interesting points that reinforce my intention to try to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, who I know is a gentleman, to reconsider the amendment. I am very grateful for the comments made by my noble friend Lord Watson and the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="07030162000087"></a>I was very anxious to emphasise at Second Reading, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, will remember, that this modest exercise and this modest Bill would be a failure if all sorts of details were not given about the European Union and our membership of it that were also adverse and negative&#151;provided, of course, that it was factual information given through respectable public channels from independent media and so on, as we discussed before, rather than tendentious statements made perhaps above all by politicians but by many other people as well. That will be the basis of the objective information to be provided in the European Union information centres. It would, I am sure, include a lot of critical information about the EU as well. It would be daft for anyone, however enthusiastic they

That would be childish in every way. As the very idea and notion of EU membership gets more implanted into the minds of the citizens of the member states and it is not regarded as a dangerous matter for their countries to be members, I think that natural desire to criticise in any democracy should grow. Perhaps in earlier stages those who were keen on our membership of the European Union overdid the defending of every aspect of it because they were so nervous about some of the existential attacks on European Union membership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="07030162000088"></a>I was a little bemused by the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I am flattered in one sense but disappointed in another as he himself clearly said that he was keen on this Bill from the point of view of providing information which he would obviously consider in a different light from some of my conclusions. I am very grateful to him for emphasising, both at Second Reading and at this Committee stage, that he thinks this Bill is a good idea from that point of view.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="07030162000089"></a>What he has done with the change of nomenclature from Chancellor of the Exchequer to Privy Council in Amendment No. 3 is to lift clauses and subsections entirely from his own European Union (Implications of Withdrawal) Bill which still awaits a Second Reading. I believe I am right in saying that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, was one of the first to propose his Bill for First Reading when the present Session of Parliament. He therefore presumably had an opportunity to set a date for Second Reading some time ago but no date has yet been fixed. Therefore I am flattered but disconcerted to see that his technique&#151;I do not accept it to be the right way of doing this&#151;is to put a provision into my Bill. Is it to make it more difficult for the Bill to proceed? The noble Lord says not and I am grateful for that. But it seems to me that that kind of clause would make it much more difficult to actuate the provisions of the Bill. There are many ways in which decisions on fundamental membership can be dealt with outside of European Union information centres, which should be routine even if the data are extensive and deal with many different sectors.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="07030162000090"></a>Therefore, I urge the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, to withdraw his amendment, if he would be so kind as to consider that as a possibility today, and to set a date for the Second Reading of his European Union (Implications of Withdrawal) Bill so that we can have another proper debate on those more fundamental aspects. It would be a pity&#151;</p>

It is a cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of the advantages to our sovereignty, defence and every aspect of our national life were we to leave the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="07030162000093"></a>With his own party in a certain amount of disarray outside this House, perhaps this is the calmest little edifice of UKIP at the moment. A classic technique of governments was to have a foreign policy adventure or initiative if things at home were bad. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is trying to emulate that with his suggestions today. However, in technical and mechanistic terms, what he is suggesting specifically would be a rather unwise way of trying to deal with what he quite rightly says are his aims and objectives; namely, to get the public to think about whetherour membership of the European Union shouldcontinue.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07030162000094"></a>One could go on at great length as these are complex matters. However, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, accidentally I am sure, misunderstands the way in which the Community functions. It is a collection of sovereign Governments working together through collective institutions which occasionally use voting procedures but often do not and legislating on behalf of all the sovereign Governments. The second chamber of the legislative process is the Council of Ministers with the European Parliament alongside and there is a democracy built in to safeguard each national member state. There is nothing for those who hesitate about our European Union membership to fear from those processes. The definition of how much legislation comes from Brussels is that legislation which has been suggested to the Commission for enactment by the sovereign member Governments&#151;the member states&#151;who want it.</p>

The way in which the Ministers in each Government safeguard the national interest is powerful, primordial inmany ways, and overriding often, as Ministers know, which is right. It reassures those in each country who want to see a proper enactment of less legislation, because Commission proposals are often couched in communications rather than legislative proposals. Where they are directed to be enacted by the member states, those directives are very broad and usually come from the Council of Ministers originally having said to the Commission, &#147;By the way, would you look into this area and present some proposals for us to act on?&#148;. I hope therefore that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, will kindly reconsider his suggestions on this occasion.</p>

With the exception of my noble friend Lord Monson, they clearly do not want to have a balanced debate of any kind on our membership of the European Union. To my noble friend Lord Monson, I would say that people who have not yet made up their minds on whether we should stay in or leave the European Union do exist. They might be found on your Lordships&#146; Cross Benches or among the judiciary. I can think of other areas of national life where they will be found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07030162000098"></a>With the greatest respect, I have to say that the noble Lord, Lord Watson, appears to have misunderstood the amendment. The proposed committee consists of seven people, two of whom would be nominated by organisations which appear to the Privy Council,</p>
<ul><a name="07030162000191"></a>&#147;to be in favour of ... continued membership of the European Union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000172"></a>I would not have thought that that would be difficult. For a start, there is the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party.</p>

<a name="70301-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="07030162000099"></a>There would also be two people nominated by organisations who appear,</p>
<ul><a name="07030162000192"></a>&#147;to be opposed to the United Kingdom&#146;s continued membership of the European Union&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07030162000173"></a>which would not be difficult either. We could certainly draw on my esteemed UK Independence Party and there are 38 other groups in this country dedicated to withdrawal from the European Union. I would think that we could take someone from there. I agree that the difficulty occurs in finding people who have no opinion, but I believe that it could be done. The rest of the amendment is self-explanatory.</p>

I do not think that those people exist. I think that the noble Lord is referring to people who are uncertain about whether the United Kingdom should stay or leave the EU. If he were at some future date, or perhaps in his Bill which has not received a Second Reading, to substitute the words &#147;be uncertain&#148; for &#147;to hold no opinion&#148;, that would improve the wording tremendously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="07030162000103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Watson, takes it for granted that the EU has made an enormous contribution to European civilisation&#151;peace since 1945 and all that&#151;while blithely ignoring, as usual, the fact that NATO has kept peace since 1945 and that the former countries of the Soviet bloc have benefited enormously by their membership of the European Union. There is of course a very powerful case to say that that is not true and that they were well on their way to economic success with their own democracies, which they have now sacrificed to the European project. I would not have thought that membership is necessarily a good thing for them at all. It is, of course, a good thing for their bureaucratic and political elites, many of whom now have jobs in Brussels&#151;or on the Brussels pay scale&#151;at rates up to 10 times that of their previous levels of employment. For the political elite, then, the European project is a good thing; but, for the peoples of Europe I suggest that that remains to be seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="07030162000110"></a>The clause is quite clear, unlike the discussions that the Committee was having on the previous clause, which seemed to me to confuse information and knowledge. A great deal has been said about those matters, but this clause is clear: it says that there should be a mandatory requirement to fly this flag. That is unnecessary and it is not a good idea. More worrying than that, it seems designed to make the idea of being good Europeans&#151;as we have been, Britain having been a good European country not only in recent years but over the centuries&#151;and of European co-operation more unpopular.</p>

People should be reasonably free to fly the flags that they want. Can the Minister tell me where the Government have got to in revising the regulations to extend the list of flags that we do not have to advertise in order to fly? I gather that the proposal is that those should include the EU flag, the Commonwealth flag and the flag of the United Nations. What is the position there?</p>

Alas, poor Beethoven. So I join the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in asking the Government what the present position on the EU flag is in this country.

Whatever it means, I intervene only to support the basic proposition of my noble friend on the Front Bench, from his more pro-European perspective. I think that there is a serious risk that trying to impose this kind of thing will generate antibodies and hostility which are not to the advantage of the European project as a whole&#151;whatever one means by that.

My noble friend Lord Watson referred to my next point on Second Reading. We are certain that the European flag is displayed far less often in this country than is the case in many other member states. However, the idea that such display should be compulsory is obnoxious and dreadful. One just wants more people to consider displaying the European flag alongside our own national flag.

I replied as politely as possible, &#147;I do not want to be discourteous but we actually joined in 1973&#148;. His response then was, &#147;Young man&#148;&#151;I liked &#147;young&#148;, by the way&#151;&#147;you&#146;ve got to get your facts straight: that was the Commonwealth&#148;.

It was a commitment to a nature of integration which is simply out of date and no longer exists. He is looking back to the glory days when the European Union seemed to be the right thing in its then form&#151;its integrationist form. But the world has moved on. The computer and the microchip have transformed the nature of international relations and, therefore, the nature of Europe and of the whole project. If the noble Lord does not understand that at present, he will come to understand it because we shall see a reformed Europe far more suited to the network age and less suited to the yearnings of the integrationists who want to create a super bloc in a world where blocs are no longer relevant.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000012"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 14 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000013"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07030169000632"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> This is a new month but a continuing Committee stage. What I am about to produce is, I think, a new point.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000014"></a>Clause 14, which is entitled &#147;Directions about work-related activity&#148;, is treated rather shortly in the Explanatory Notes, which state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000541"></a>&#147;Clause 14 provides a power for the Secretary of State to direct that a specific activity in the case of an individual is not to count as work-related activity. This is intended to stop claimants seeking to satisfy the requirement to undertake work-related activity by undertaking activity that is considered inappropriate for their circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000529"></a>We will come to an amendment in a few minutes&#146; time that addresses some of that. If we were discussing this matter as an Oral Question, I would ask the Minister a very brief question, such as &#147;How?&#148;. The reason is that I do not understand what this clause is doing. Will the Minister give us an example of how this would work? Although I suspect that it is a sensible provision, I should like that to be confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000015"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07030169000633"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am happy to confirm that this is a sensible provision.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000016"></a>Clause 14 will permit the Secretary of State, through personal advisers, to direct that a given activity is not to be treated as work-related activity. I am aware of the concerns that have been raised outside this House on this clause and I hope that I can reassure noble Lords that we cannot and will not force customersto do a particular activity or unfairly deny them opportunities.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000017"></a>Clause 12(7) defines work-related activity widely as activity that will make it more likely that a customer will be able to obtain or retain work. This could cover a very wide range of activities and therefore allow the individual to choose the right ones for them. This is fundamental to a tailored approach that is based on choice for the individual.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC240"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000018"></a>Regulations under the clause will set out the circumstances where directions can be issued. We believe that there will be cases where it is wholly inappropriate for individuals to pursue certain activities, even though these activities would meet the definition of work-related activity. In particular, we are thinking of the situation in which someone is provided with support to enter a particular type of job but states that he does not want to take up the job after finishing the course. I do not want to be too specific on this but it is effectively a failsafe mechanism if people are intent on trying to thwart the provisions. Given that we start with a wide definition of work-related activity&#151;necessarily, because it is a key part of the process&#151;we need to build in possible protections about its misuse.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000019"></a>I do not believe that in these or similar circumstances a customer should be able to meet a work-related activity requirement by taking the approach that I have just outlined. It would not be fair to other customers who were endeavouring to overcome potential barriers and, where it incurred any cost to the Exchequer, it would be unfair to taxpayers. I believe that these cases will be extremely rare but it is right that we have the powers to deal with them where they arise.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000020"></a>Any directions made under this clause will of course be subject to a right of appeal. Furthermore, when a direction has been made, the customer can undertake any other type of work-related activity to meet the work-related activity requirement.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000021"></a>If a customer who had been issued with a direction in respect of a particular activity failed to undertake another type of activity and did not have good cause for this, his benefit would be liable to a sanction. However, he would also have a further, separate right of appeal against the decision under Clause 12 that led to the imposition of the sanction.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000022"></a>Although we firmly believe that a collaborative approach with customers should be the norm, it is necessary to be able to act where a customer is undermining the principle and intent of the support that we are offering. I hope that I have provided sufficient clarity to the noble Lord and that he will now be able to support the clause.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000023"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07030169000634"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am delighted to hear that the provision is basically designed to stop the &#147;thwarting&#148;&#151;I think that that was the word that the Minister used&#151;of the purposes of the Bill by a customer claimant. I readily understand that. I am sure that the Joint Committee on Human Rights will be delighted by the two rights of appeal which the Minister has just highlighted. That is extremely helpful. I will study what he said as usual, but, for the moment, I am more than content with the clause.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000024"></a>Clause 14 agreed to.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000025"></a>Clause 15 [<I>Contracting out</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="07030169000026"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07030169000635"></a>Lord Skelmersdale</b> moved Amendment No. 75:</p>

</ul>
<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000027"></a>The noble Lord said: I return to probing. This is a probing amendment which will give us the opportunity to discuss the many questions and concerns which have arisen out of the contracting-out of assessments  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and support provision to third-party groups, both not-for-profit organisations and private companies. Many people feel that the provision of benefits and support for disabled people should remain under the direct control of government and should not be privatised out to less directly accountable bodies. These concerns are shared by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which called the attention of the House to this clause in its report on the Bill.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000028"></a>However, we on these Benches are not entirely pessimistic. Tendering out these jobs could lead to great advantages in terms of effectiveness and the standard of service offered to claimants. There are, however, legitimate concerns about the finer details of the contracts, and we hope that the Minister will offer strong reassurance on them.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000029"></a>One of the greatest concerns is that third-party organisations might be tempted to cherry-pick claimants who need the least support to make them capable of work. The Government have already done much to reassure us on this matter, but some questions remain. In particular, the breakdown of how payment will be awarded has led to controversy.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000030"></a>The Government have explained that they intend to pay contracted organisations in three separate chunks: 30 per cent up front for administration costs when they take the claimant on to their books; 50 per cent when the claimant reaches certain job outcomes; and the remaining 20 per cent after the claimanthas remained in work for a sustained period. Unfortunately, this information has led me to think about even more questions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000031"></a>The explanatory material that we have received states that the initial 30 per cent will be paid in monthly instalments. How will these instalments be calculated, given that it is impossible to know how long a claimant will need before he reaches the first of the outcomes and so triggers more financial reward? Will not a claimant who seems likely to make slow progress towards an outcome therefore attract a lower monthly instalment than one who is closer to employment, and will not that in turn make organisations less willing to take him on?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000032"></a>For the outcome-based payment, the material begs the question what exactly these outcomes will be. Will they be set individually for each claimant and, if so, by whom? There would surely be a conflict of interest if the personal advisers, based in the contracting organisations, set the benchmarks that the claimants had to work towards. Yet, if they are standardised outcomes, there is again the danger that claimants with a lot of ground to cover will be too expensive for the contracting organisations to take on.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000033"></a>The potential contractors to whom I have spoken have stated that, rather than have set levels to reach, they would prefer payment of the 50 per cent instalment to be based on measured improvement. Will the Minister explain why the Government have decided not to go down this route?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000034"></a>Finally, on the last 20 per cent, I understand that six months has been suggested as a sensible amount of time for the claimant to have been in employment for it to be considered &#147;sustained&#148;, which I think is the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC242"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>word used in the explanatory material. Does the claimant just have to be in work or must he be completely off benefits as well? If, after six months, he were then to become unemployed again and rejoin ESA, would the organisation handling his claim receive the 30 per cent initial payment all over again and would the payment process restart from that point or would the contractor&#146;s past involvement be taken into account? Would the newly out-of-work ex-claimant necessarily have the same personal adviser, or even the same contractor? That is quite important.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000035"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to these questions. I hope that he will do much to reassure the many organisations that have contacted me on these points. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000036"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07030169000636"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> We return to the fray this afternoon with a somewhat depleted team on this side of the Committee. There are currently only two of us here; we felt that we perhaps had an unfair advantage yesterday. I apologise on behalf of my noble friend Lord Addington, who is speaking in the Olympics debate but will join us shortly.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000037"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, we do not object in principle to involving either the voluntary or private sectors in this way. We are possibly even more sceptical than the Conservatives about how it will work in practice, however, and possibly more concerned to see effective safeguards. The parallels with the National Health Service are quite strong, where the Government have had an ideological drive to privatise, and that is no doubt the background to these proposals. We clearly see the cheap, easy and quick-win operations and procedures of the private sector there and the parallels with the more difficult problems and people, particularly those with mental health difficulties, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, so movingly described last night, being left to the state. We will be scrutinising this closely and we want a great deal of reassurance from the Minister that that position will not arise out of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000038"></a>We have already talked a good deal about commercial confidentiality in the Committee. Will the Minister give us the strongest assurance he can that, when these arrangements have been set up and Parliament properly wants to scrutinise how they are working in a year or two&#146;s time, the Government will not hide behind this commercial confidentiality mantra? To be honest, when we have probed it in other areas, it has often proved to be just a cover to avoid embarrassment for the department; the commercial companies have often said that they have no objection to revealing that information.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000039"></a>I do not propose to rehearse the detailed questions of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, which seemed very proper. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000040"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07030169000637"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am grateful for the broad acknowledgement that using providers as envisaged has support in principle. I well understand the need for noble Lords to have detail and reassurances on some areas.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000041"></a>The contracting out of the functions of the Secretary of State in Clauses 11, 13 and 14 is an important part of our strategy to help those with disabilities or health  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC243"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conditions back into work. Contracted providers have a wealth of experience and expertise in delivering employment support to this group of customers. In addition, contracted organisations may be able to reach customers with whom the Government have difficulty engaging. We also want to ensure that we deliver flexible and tailored support, and providers are well placed to adapt their provision to suit the needs of individual customers. These advantages apply to delivering mandatory elements of the ESA conditionality programme as well as to voluntary support, and we should take advantage of them.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000042"></a>Having a single organisation responsible for the delivery of a majority of functions makes the programme simpler for the customer to understand and engage with, and helps him to build a better relationship with his adviser. It also makes clearer the connection between the support that we are making available, and the responsibility of the customer to engage with the process&#151;a principle at the heart of these reforms.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000043"></a>Of course, we need to ensure that standards are adhered to and that the legislation relating to work-focused interviews, action plans and directions will apply equally to contractors as to Jobcentre Plus. The same rights of appeal and review will apply. We will work closely with providers to ensure that they understand their responsibilities and that there is consistency in delivery.</p>
<h5><a name="07030169000614"></a>2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000044"></a>I am aware of concerns that outcome-based funding will result in those customers that may need more intensive help being left behind, or that providers will push people into employment or training that is simply not appropriate. I can assure noble Lords that we will do everything we can, as we are doing in the current Pathways to Work rollout, to ensure that that is not the case.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000045"></a>In provider-led Pathways areas we are asking providers, as part of their bids for contracts, to detail how they will ensure support is in place for all customers. Bids will be assessed by procurement professionals, and an organisation that cannot deliver to the required standard will not be successful. In addition, after contracts have been awarded, Jobcentre Plus will work closely with providers to ensure that the services put in place are fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000046"></a>We will put in place contract management processes to review periodically provider performance, and to ensure that they are delivering the support that we expect. Concentrating only on those customers that are closest to the labour market and easiest to help would clearly fall short of that and will be dealt with appropriately.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000047"></a>By contracting out work-focused interviews, action plans and, later on, directions, we will ensure that these mandatory elements of ESA are fully integrated with the employment support that we offer. Most importantly, we will ensure that the considerable expertise found in public, private and voluntary sector organisations is utilised to the benefit of all customers.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000048"></a>I will try to cover some of the specific questions asked. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked for assurances that the Pathways contracts will be in the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public domain. All current procurement documentation is in the public domain. We will continue to place it in the public domain wherever possible.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000049"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Oakeshott, asked whether the contracts encourage providers to help only those people with fewer support needs. I touched on this, but just to emphasise, bids for Pathways to Work contracts for potential providers should include details of the skills and experience which would enable them to address the specific needs and barriers of all customers. Bids will be assessed against that information. In any funding regime based on outcomes, there are risks that the providers will concentrate on the easiest to help. We need to be mindful of that. However, we intend to mitigate that risk as much as possible by reviewing for four months to ensure that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000050"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07030169000638"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Would the noble Lord kindly repeat that? I missed about three words in what he has just said.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000051"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07030169000639"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I shall try again. Bids for Pathways to Work contracts for potential providers should include details of the skills and experience which would enable them to address the specific needs and barriers of all customers. Bids will be assessed against that information. In any funding regime on outcomes, there is a risk that providers will concentrate on the easiest to help. However, we intend to mitigate that risk as much as possible by reviewing providers&#146; performance to ensure that this is not the case.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about what happens if a customer moves into work but subsequently reapplies for ESA, and whether providers get a second outcome payment if he finds work again. If a customer returns to Pathways to Work after a spell off benefit contractors can only claim another outcome-based payment for him if they have claimed a sustained payment in between. Providers cannot simply get people into short-term jobs and continue getting outcome payments for them.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000053"></a>The noble Lord asked about the instalments of a 30 per cent service fee. The service fee is 30 per cent of the contract value. It will be spread over the lifetime of the total contract and paid monthly.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000054"></a>The general issue of the nature and structure of payment arrangements was raised and whether there could be payments based on distance travelled. Obviously, a small movement in one customer&#146;s employment prospects would represent a far greater distance travelled than a larger movement in another customer. Setting interim targets can make the distance appear further to some customers. We need also to bear in mind that the ultimate goal here is to enable customers to enter employment with all the financial, social and health benefits that it can bring, and it is, therefore, right that, however far away it may be, employment is the visible goal.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000055"></a>I hope I have addressed each point that noble Lords raised, but I am happy to have a second go if I have not.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000057"></a>The first is the extent to which we can assure ourselves that the capacity exists for personal advisers in the marketplace generally. From my previous incarnation in the other place, I know that Ministers were honest enough to acknowledge at that stage, which was some time ago, that there was a risk that when work was needed to start, the number of people available to perform that crucial role was not then in place. Can the Minister reassure me that the contractors that we are talking about in this amendment will have access to a big enough body of professionally trained people? That is an important part and we have to be there by &#147;A-day&#148;; so maybe the answer is &#147;not yet, but we are on track&#148;. I would settle for that assurance&#151;it is an essential part of this process.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000058"></a>More generally, given my experience of working with companies in the field, it will be difficult for a level playing field to be created for social enterprises generally and collective third-sector organisations. I would really love&#151;and I tried to persuade some of my colleagues and friends in the third sector at the CPAG annual meeting last summer&#151;them to band together to make a bid for one of these important contracts to see the quality that they could bring to it. There are conflicts between their advisory role, and their independence must be protected, but I would love to see a group of them getting together, because the clients and customers would, perhaps unfairly, feel much more reassured about being in a context where Citizens Advice was built into the provision of the services. The reason why that will be jolly hard is that the big companies&#151;who, I must say, discharge their functions in a professional way and I have nothing against them&#151;have resources behind them that are simply not available for not-for-profit enterprises.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000059"></a>The Wise Group, of which I am a director, is one of those. It lives from year to year on budgets that have to be carefully adjusted on almost a monthly basis, because the money is not there to provide the cushion and the buffer for investment and training. The companies that that organisation will be competing against for these contracts will be dealing in bulk, will have economies of scale, will have very deep pockets indeed and if it is left simply to the marketplace, it will be very difficult for innovative, creative, and genuinely interested new groups of people to try to enter this important area without large resources behind them. When I ask them what the Government need to do to put that right, they say they need development grants of capital, involving some shareholding in the company; I do not know whether that would work as it would be difficult for the Government to start buying interests in social enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000060"></a>However, there must be some mechanism. I would feel much more comfortable about this amendment if I was given some assurance that these problems were properly appreciated and that everything that could be done was being done to try to make this easier for social enterprises involving third-sector charitable organisations, which have a wealth of experience in

It is lying there on the shelf&#151;if they cannot get access to that, it would be a great shame.</p>

One way of opening up these contracts to not-for-profit organisations would be if there were a different contract value for some of the more difficult-to-place persons. I had in mind to ask the Minister that question anyway. For example, one can imagine that some of these people will need very specific work-related activities. Obviously, noble Lords will not be surprised if I mention evidence-based psychological therapy. But if contractors are to make that sort of vitally necessary support available, they will need a higher-value contract. That would also take account of the lack of basic resource available to the not-for-profit organisations.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000062"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07030169000642"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> It may be easier if I add to those two contributions. The relationship between the customer and the personal adviser will be absolutely vital, and it may well be that the individual in the contracted organisation will not be appropriate for a particular customer. On that point, there is likely to be a much better relationship with an individual customer who suffers from, say, mental health or stroke problems or whatever if the contract goes to someone with specialist knowledge, as we have said before. That is likely to come from the not-for-profit sector and not from the big commercial firms which have been mentioned. I do not know whether the Minister wants me to stop there but I also have questions about the contracts.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000063"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07030169000643"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Perhaps I may respond to the points raised in what has been a helpful and valuable small debate on the important issues of capacity and engaging with groups. The third sector has specialist knowledge, great understanding and works with many of our customers on a routine basis. </p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000064"></a>I reiterate that we believe that, in terms of the provider contract, it is right for a single organisation to be responsible for the overall delivery of the functions. That is the starting point. The documentation relating to the invitation to tender has been placed in the Library and I hope that noble Lords have been able to access it. It sets out some of the key areas that we will be addressing in that process. In particular, providers will need to give details of the qualifications and experience of their staff and they will also need to provide details of the training arrangements fornew and existing staff. So testing the capacity and experience of the organisation and its staff will play a key part.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000065"></a>I was asked whether we are forcing out smaller providers by contracting by district, but I do not believe that we are. We acknowledge that smaller providers may not have the capacity or experience to bid for large contracts, but we have encouraged them throughout this procurement process to form consortia in order to bid. We have also encouraged larger organisations to form links with smaller or niche providers, and we have published details of interested organisations on the internet to facilitate that. So the

Obviously, it is impossible and inappropriate to be too prescriptive about this up-front, because we want flexibility in these arrangements in order to be able to address the individual needs of our customer base.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000066"></a>I think that I dealt with the issue of training and the skills for which we are looking from providers. Capacity is an important issue, but we have already Jobcentre Plus and pathways into Jobcentre Plus in 40 per cent of the country and have proved that there are high-quality individuals out there who can and do participate in providing services under the arrangements, so we are optimistic, but it is important that we have capacity to deliver on this very important programme. We are confident that the processes and mechanisms that we have in place should enable that to happen.</p>

Access to payment by results will be based on people being in work for a certain number of hours over a period and not on benefits for a period, but the precise quality or nature of the job is not a key consideration. I am given reassurances from behind me on that point. I hope that that deals with the point.</p>

The case loading for the contract will be crucial. Is it too early to say what will be the range of the average caseload compared to the pilot projects? My experience is that if you ask personal advisers to deal with much more than 40 or 50 cases at any given time, that puts them under some pressure. Is there a target? That tracks back into the capacity question because if we do not have enough of those people, they will have to do more. Do the Government have any view about that or is it too early to say exactly where that figure will rest? Obviously, it will differ in different parts of the country, but any guidance on that would be helpful.</p>

I am interested that the Minister says that the department will encourage consortia to form; that will make provision for specialist providers and the sort of people whom I have just said that I believe will be able to set up a far better relationship with the individual customer than might otherwise be the case.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000072"></a>Does the Minister envisage those large commercial firms&#151;as most of them are likely to be&#151;subcontracting to the not-for-profit sector in particular cases? He talked about the contract document in the Library, but I saw nothing in that covering that point. It strikes me that it would be a good idea but I am not entirely sure that the department could force on contractors as part of the contract. If the noble Lord could respond to that, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is probably right to say that it would not be right to specify subcontractors in contracts, because that would assume upfront the nature of all the client/customer needs with which the provider would have to deal. However, as I said earlier, we would encourage organisations to consider being subcontractors to the main providers. Presumably, part of the main providers&#146; bids will have to say how they will be able to access specialist knowledge and input so that they can cover the full range of customers with whom we will ask them to deal.</p>

This has been a useful discussion on a rather complicated area. I am grateful to the Minister for his several responses to the amendment and I thank all noble Lords who have spoken. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000077"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving AmendmentNo. 76 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 77 to 81. I am slightly surprised that this grouping exists, but I was not in a position to object to it and perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, will explain. I should like to add to the concerns I expressed on the previous amendments and concentrate this time on the contracting-out of sanctioning powers. This is the most controversial aspect of the clause and the one that potentially could have the most damaging effect not only on the success of the ESA in getting people back into work, but also on claimants themselves. Lobby groups have been concerned that this policy will endanger the relationship that builds up between an organisation providing support and advice and a claimant. That relationship of trust is obviously of the greatest importance. Do the Government not feel that by empowering one organisation both to provide the advice and support claimants need to move towards employment and to authorise sanctions that will reduce their benefits, they will be setting up a conflict of interest in this area? Since I prepared my notes on this amendment, I have discovered that in fact the sanctions are only to be imposed having been, as it were, authorised by a delegation of the Secretary of State and not to the individual contractors. Perhaps the noble Lord will confirm that that is correct.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>

However, there are undoubtedly still questions remaining. How will the decision to impose sanctions be taken? Will it be made in the contracted organisation? Again, as I have just said, I suspect not. Or will the contractors need to refer to a decision-maker such as in the assessment phase? If the organisations themselves have the power to apply sanctions themselves&#151;in other words, that I am wrong in the theory I have just advanced&#151;will there be outside assessment of the consistency and appropriateness of their decisions? We need to see quite a lot more information on this area and other issues of contracting before we can pronounce ourselves truly satisfied with the safeguards that the Government are implementing. I hope that the Minister will provide this advice before the Report stage so that the debate can move on. I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 77 to 81 tabled in my name and that of my noble friend. I propose to focus my remarks mainly on Amendment No. 76 because it raises very important questions. While I stand to be corrected, I do not think I quite understand the assurances that the noble Lord believes have been given by the Minister. Our amendments are really just to ensure that in areas such as disability discrimination and so forth, the outside contractors are properly controlled and operating in the same way as the Jobcentre staff would.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000080"></a>On the basic question of sanctioning, we read carefully the various assurances given under pressure by the Minister, Mr Murphy, in the Commons. I am bound to say that I was, again, taken with what the Conservative Member for South West Surrey,Mr Hunt, said. He was talking about the concern expressed by private and voluntary sector organisations that it is fundamentally against their ethos to be judges; they want to support and help someone who is trying to engage in the world of work. If wewere talking about sanctions, that would be a fundamentally different role, and that seems to me to be very important.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000081"></a>My colleague, Danny Alexander, pressed the Minister to say under what circumstances Ministers would seek to give the private and voluntary sectors the power to make decisions about whether someone&#146;s benefit should be sanctioned. The Minister gave a series of replies, none of which was satisfactory. I hope that, having taken account of that, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, will be able to go further and to be more specific than Mr Murphy was in the Commons. He said, first, that, as the capacities of the private and voluntary sectors evolved, decision-making could be passed down to them. He then talked about considering changing the location of the benefit-entitlement decision-maker. He then very firmly said:</p>

<p><a name="07030169000082"></a>In summing up that discussion, I think it would be fair to say that the Minister was effectively saying, &#147;We have no plans to outsource benefit cutting or sanctioning for the foreseeable future but we are going to defend to the death our right to do it&#148;. That, to me, is wrong. Either they are planning to do it or, if not and if they have no plans for the foreseeable future, that provision should not be in the Bill and a further Bill should be brought forward in due course in a few years&#146; time if that is what they want.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000083"></a>We have had a good deal of discussion in this Committee, particularly about the problems of mentally ill people and the difficulties that they already have with the system, but are we seriously prepared to give Ministers the power to let private contractors cut benefit for mentally ill people? We on these Benches believe that that would be an unacceptable abdication of responsibility by the Government towards their most vulnerable citizens. I look forward to the noble Lord reassuring us better than the Minister was able to do in the Commons.</p>

If is of interest that this amendment is supported by a lot of organisations: Rethink, Mencap, the National Autistic Society, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. I think that that gives some idea of the degree of concern about the likelihood that those groups of people might experience the regime as discriminatory, although I am absolutely sure that that is not at all the Government&#146;s intent.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000085"></a>Clearly a lot of these worries centre on the contracting-out of this work and the use of payment by results in the contracted-out environment. This again takes me back to the issue of the Pathways pilots being undertaken in-house, as I understand it, yet they have not managed to achieve what I am sure they were hoping for these most disadvantaged groups.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000086"></a>Does the Minister have any indication from the pilots that have not proved to be successful of different ways of working which could then be incorporated into the rollout? He referred to the importance of training and ensuring that people are trained, yet yesterday he implied that my reference to a particular jobcentre manager might not have been representative and he said he was sure that all these people are trained.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000087"></a>These are difficult questions. I am anything but convinced that Jobcentre Plus people, whether in Pathways or outside it, really have the necessary training to provide a service that gives real equality of opportunity for these very disadvantaged groups compared with the easier-option groups. I find it very difficult to envisage that this Bill could come into operation across the country when, as I see it, we simply do not yet have a model that we know can work for these very disadvantaged groups. I say with certainty. I know that the Pathways evaluation has not been published but there is enough evidence around to show that we just do not have a model. Can the Minister give me any assurance at all that these

It is important that we do not dismiss the possible benefits of such an approach. Contracting-out of decision-making could reduce hand-offs between two organisations, which in turn would speed up the process and reduce the potential for miscommunication.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000089"></a>We should also bear in mind that the decision on whether to contract out decision-making has genuinely not yet been taken. The fact that it has not yet been taken is not a reason for not having the provision in the legislation should we decide to do so in due course. We need to ensure that the basic ESA and Pathways structures are in place and working before we embark on further change, and there are still a number of issues to be explored around the process involved. For example, we envisage that there would need to be a separation of roles between the decision-maker in an organisation and the personal adviser&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised that point&#151;and we need to discuss with providers and stakeholders how we could make this and other processes work in practice.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000090"></a>We do not accept that providers will use their own decision-makers to sanction inappropriately in order to get better results. The same decision-making standards, regulations, safeguards and rights of appeal would apply regardless of whether a decision-maker is located in Jobcentre Plus or in a contracted organisation. We would also ensure that decision-makers receive the training they need to enable them to make decisions properly and with consistency.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000091"></a>We have accepted the Delegated Powers Committee recommendation on Clause 15(2) and tabled amendments accordingly. We have already debated these yesterday and, as noble Lords will be aware, this means that regulations made under Clause 15(2) relating to decision-making that could lead to sanctions will be subject to agreement by both Houses of Parliament. There will be a chance for Parliament to scrutinise.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000092"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 77, which would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to authorise providers to supersede decisions. This would mean that while providers could be authorised to take decisions and revise those decisions, they could not supersede those decisions. The effect of that would be that the removal of a sanction would be a slower process requiring additional hand-offs to Jobcentre Plus, and this would clearly not be in the interest of the customer.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000093"></a>I turn Amendments Nos. 78 and 80. I fully understand the concerns that noble Lords have raised regarding the training and skills of potential providers. I again hope that I can reassure them as to our intentions. There will already be a need to demonstrate a certain level of skill and experience. One of the criteria on which we will assess a contractor's bid in provider-led  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC252"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Pathways areas will be that they have the experience and skills needed to deliver services properly. I dealt with that in the preceding amendment. In addition, contractors will be assessed in respect of training arrangements for both new and existing staff and on their approach to ensuring year-on-year improvement in performance.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000094"></a>We must recognise that in many cases providers actually have greater expertise in these areas than government, particularly when a customer has specialist or complex needs. This is precisely why we want to engage with providers in this way.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000095"></a>Providers will also need to put in place diversity training plans, equality and harassment policies&#151;a point particularly focused on by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher&#151;and, as part of the contract, will need to comply with these policies. In addition, all providers will need to be accredited before any contract is awarded. This accreditation is done by an independent organisation. Momenta will do that for the current Pathways to Work procurement. The accreditation ensures that the provider is compliant with all statutory requirements&#151;for example, health and safety, equal opportunities policy, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000096"></a>Amendment No. 80 also includes a power to prescribe that specialist support for customers with specific impairments must be secured before a provider can be authorised to undertake functions under Clause 15.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000097"></a>A key principle underpinning provider-led Pathways to Work, on which support under ESA is to be based, is that providers should be flexible in the provision that they deliver and be free to take account of local needs and priorities. Prescribing what support must be available is in direct opposition to this principle. Again, we have dealt with this in the earlier amendment.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000098"></a>It would be unreasonable to ask providers to ignore the highest priorities in their local areas to concentrate on those with specific conditions that we prescribe nationally. We would also be in danger of creating a league table of health conditions where, however good our intentions, priority will be given to some customers before others. That would simply create the cherry-picking that we are all keen to avoid.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000099"></a>As regards Amendment No. 79, Clause 15(7) provides that in most cases any act or omission of contractors in carrying out functions is to be treated for all purposes as an act done or omitted by the Secretary of State. That means that the Secretary of State remains responsible for ensuring that these functions are carried out in a way that is compatible with the Disability Discrimination Act and disability equality duty. For example, Pathways contracts will have clauses that prohibit discrimination and harassment on grounds of disability, among others. The Pathways specification will also require providers to provide reasonable adjustments, to ensure customers can participate fully, and to promote equality of opportunity. We are currently reviewing and updating the Pathways contracts to ensure that providers are specifically bound to have regard to the individual strands within the disability equality duty in providing their services.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000100"></a>Amendment No. 81 seeks to ensure that providers give us management information broken down by impairment. The amendment is unnecessary. We would already collect information about job entries, sustained outcomes and who has started work-related activity. That will be done as a part of the funding and payment arrangements. Jobcentre Plus will also hold data on the medical condition of customers and, as part of the evaluation and monitoring of provider-led Pathways to Work, we will be able to break down outcome information by condition.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000103"></a>I will try to deal with some of the other questions. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said that some providers would not want to take on the task of sanctioning, but we know that some providers want these powers. Shaw Trust and WorkDirections have indicated that they do&#151;and they obviously do not believe that it will undermine their relationships. It is important that there are processes and arrangements in place to ensure that it does not.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000104"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked what evaluation of Pathways to date we can incorporate. That evaluation is ongoing. One of the advantages of getting voluntary and private sectors involved is that they can be more flexible and innovative. But all providers will be reviewed regularly. It is an ongoing, developing process. It is important that we recognise that, which is why we should not rush into enabling sanctions to be passed to providers until we are clear about the total direction of our proposed programme.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000105"></a>I think that that I have dealt with the question whether decision-makers will have to be separate from personal advisers. We certainly envisage that there would be some separation of these roles, just as there is in Jobcentre Plus, but there is a great deal of work that we need to do with providers to determine how this could work in practice and how to deal with this in the contracts.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000106"></a>I hope that I have dealt with the concerns of noble Lords, but I stress again that regulations on sanctions would be affirmative if we were to move forward with them. There will be an opportunity for your Lordships' House and another place to debate them.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000108"></a>On the fundamental principle behind Amendment No. 76, I am not reassured in the slightest.

The Bill started in another place on4 July last year. We have now had the results and critique of the first pilots, but the Government have still not come to a conclusion. We have also had the comments of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on this matter, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000545"></a>&#147;We remain concerned that, generally, contract compliance will not provide effective protection for the Convention rights of individuals where the functions of public authorities are assumed on a day-to-day basis by a private commercial or voluntary organisation. We draw this matter to the attention of both Houses&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000530"></a>That is exactly why the noble Lord and I tabled this series of amendments. I am now much more concerned than I was when I introduced the amendment.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000112"></a>It is inevitable that, since different contractors will exist in different parts of the country, a postcode lottery will develop, with different providers applying the regulations in different ways. We are concerned also by the degree of accountability that would be available in such integral decisions were they to be contracted out, although the Minister tried hard to satisfy us on that point.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000113"></a>Those decisions which will have a direct impact on the level of benefit that an individual receives should be maintained within the decision-making structures of the DWP and the delegated powers of the Secretary of State, as I said when I introduced the amendment.

It is a probing amendment to explore the Government&#146;s intentions behind Clause 16. I understand that the calculations of income and capital, on which rests the eligibility of the income-related strand of ESA, are critical, and also that the Secretary of State needs some flexibility in this matter. I hope that the Minister can enlighten me as to whether the Government have any plans to amend the current arrangements for incapacity benefit as ESA is rolled out.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000125"></a>I have also chosen to hang this issue on subsection (3)(a) because the circumstance immediately jumps out as rather unusual, although all of them seem to be rather counter-intuitive. After all, if capital income can be defined as the Government wish, why do they need paragraphs (c) and (d) at all? Can the Minister give me some indication of when regulations creating these circumstances would be considered necessary? I beg to move.</p>

Subsection 3(a) of the clause provides that a customer may be treated as possessing income or capital which he does not possess. The measure is designed to prevent abuse of the system. For example, a person could deliberately spend all their capital in order to qualify for benefit or they could get close friends or family to hold it for them. That would clearly be unfair on others and would undermine the principles of a means-tested scheme. It enables us to say that they still have that capital and thereby not award them benefit. Similar provisions already exist within income support and other social security benefits.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000127"></a>There is nothing new about this concept. It is absolutely right that the protection is there and, as is usual, customers would have a right of appeal to an independent appeal tribunal where the power was used.

Later this afternoon, the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, will be talking about the Social Fund, which of course is not in the Bill. There are other matters that go much wider than straightforward benefit alterations. In certain parts, the Bill amends the Social Security Administration Act 1992.

To be more specific, subsection (4) provides a power to make regulations prescribing how income from capital holdings will be taken into account in calculating ESA. Normally, capital will be deemed to have an assumed tariff income for the purposes of assessing entitlement. The intention is that a tariff income of &#163;1 a week for every &#163;250, or part thereof, will be applied to capital over &#163;6,000, or &#163;10,000 for those in residential care and nursing homes, up to and including &#163;16,000. That is the way that income from capital assets is determined for other income-related benefits, such as income support and income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We shall simply roll forward the current arrangements in benefits legislation, but we need to do it specifically for ESA because of its income-related component.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000141"></a>Although there have been several interim studies of the Pathways to Work initiative, there has not been a full evaluation of it, or a review of the assessment procedures by which benefit entitlement will be determined&#151;a matter which has come up more than once during this Committee stage. Other noble Lords, especially the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, have demonstrated why this is particularly important for those with mental health problems, as the evidence which is available so far does not show that there has been a marked impact on this group of people. What we are asking for is simply to know what works and what does not. After all, we do not want a vulnerable person&#146;s mental state made worse by inappropriate actions. One major question which has been touched on before is whether the money allocated to the national rollout of the programme to the whole of Britain by 2008 is adequate. Will there, for example, be enough staff trained to cope with people who may need a great deal more time and effort than the staff are used to? That is why it is so important for there to be a full evaluation and report on the Pathways to Work programme.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000142"></a>Amendment No. 91 would remove the power to apply different regulations to different geographical areas unless it was for the purpose of piloting new schemes. Under the clause, there could be, for example, different conditionality regimes and different work-related activity provision across the country. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether that could be the case under Clause 24. Surely the law in this area needs to be applied consistently so that it is not seen to be unfair

As the Bill went through another place, issues were raised on the level of funding. The pilot schemes were considerably better funded per head than the rollout was going to be. We have also heard serious concerns expressed about the size of the pilots. With fewer than 100 claimants piloted, doubts have arisen as to how representative the data gathered can be, especially in the field of mental health.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000144"></a>Pilot schemes are always subject to some difficulties. They tend to be voluntary, as they were in this case, which makes piloting conditionality almost meaningless, yet the criticism reserved for these pilots has been considerably stronger than might have been expected. It has been argued that not only were the numbers of claimants inadequate for any kind of meaningful analysis but they were also heavily weighted towards those with physical disabilities. As the mental disability assessments are the newest and least familiar part of the ESA&#151;a point that I made yesterday&#151;this is surprising. Why did the Government not ensure that there was more representative piloting&#151;or, indeed, is the current piloting more representative?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000145"></a>We have also heard that some organisations have been unable to see crucial parts of the assessments in advance. For example, the computer system is apparently not available for studying due to copyright restrictions. Given the Government&#146;s appalling track record on managing computer systems, would it not be sensible to allow as many involved parties as possible to test and comment on the new system? Further, why have the Government not retained joint copyright over the system rather than allowing the company from which they commissioned it to retain all rights?</p>

The amount of criticism that has been levelled at the pilot schemes would suggest that some fairly strong measures will be needed to restore confidence in them, and I hopethat the noble Baroness the Minister&#151;in the termsof the Interpretation Act, Peers are unisex; Imust never forget that&#151;will consider these proposals carefully.</p>

That is the public domain and we have already discussed that report to some extent.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000148"></a>The Department for Work and Pensions produced a working paper on Pathways performance in January last year and published Pathways statistics in December; these will be updated quarterly and this is what the department calls administrative information. We have so far published 10 important externally commissioned research reports as soon as they were available and will continue to do so as reports are commissioned in due course.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000149"></a>Any future pilot made under this Bill will be subject to similarly rigorous research and we are committed&#151;I stress that we are committed&#151;to publishing any results as quickly as the analysis of the data will allow. The key to our continued success is to continue finding out what works. That means tailoring support on the basis of sound evidence from constructive and appropriate pilots. Any attempt to prevent any pilots until such time as there is a final report on Pathways would severely restrict the department&#146;s ability to innovate and test future improvements in provision, although I fully understand the sentiments behind the amendments. It would also misrepresent the true nature of evaluation, which is a continuous process, feeding back valuable lessons learnt from experience to further refine the service for customers. The current programme of research and analysis is anticipated to continue until 2009 for Jobcentre Plus areas and until 2011 for provider-led districts.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000150"></a>As we are committed to the further use of pilots where necessary, we also consider that subsection (7) must remain as it stands. It is an invaluable tool for ensuring that a pilot scheme can be extended beyond 24 months, if required. I can reassure noble Lords that all pilots, including extensions of pilots, are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure providing the House with the opportunity to debate in full and approve the proposals before implementation. That will not only give the House the right to know what is happening, but will give stakeholders externally the right to see, comment and have a handle on how the research is progressing.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000151"></a>Our record shows that the reporting regime for pilots is already appropriate, that the proposed amendments are unnecessary, and that the effect of leaving out Clause 18(7) is unwelcome.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000152"></a>Amendment No. 91 deals with Clause 24(6). This clause was included to allow us to roll out implementation of regulations under any of Clauses 10 to 14 gradually across the country, if this proves necessary. Perhaps I may return to some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, yesterday on the need to be practical about rolling out the new policy initiatives and we have to be careful that we do not do things too quickly and we do them in a phased manner. That will not be possible without these provisions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000153"></a>This is the approach we have taken with Pathways to Work provision, which is rolling out instages, starting with the original pilot schemes in October 2003, towards full national coverage byApril 2008. The option to roll out such new provision in stages allows lessons to be learnt from each stage of the evaluation which can be fed into subsequent phases;  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC260"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensures that measures are appropriate and effective; and that, at all times, the needs of the customer are put first.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000154"></a>For example, we envisage that it may be necessary to roll out the work-related activity requirement area by area&#151;this picks up on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;so that we can offer the best possible customer experience by not attempting to implement too much too fast. We will need to ensure that such a rollout of provision does not lead to any unfair treatment. By restricting Clause 24(6) solely to pilot schemes, the amendment would prevent us from taking that steady approach but would not alter the functioning of pilot schemes themselves, as provision is already made in Clause 18 allowing pilots to apply only in specific areas.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000155"></a>On the research record of the DWP generally, I emphasise that, in the first place, the PCA was reviewed by the technical working group to which reference has already been made. The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform in another place gave a commitment that we will continue to use the independent technical working group to evaluate the revised PCA after it is implemented. It would be appropriate for the first evaluation to take place during 2009, once the revised PCA has been in use for some months. We will make the result of that evaluation publicly available&#151;including to both Houses. It is important to emphasise that for the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000156"></a>On the question of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about the computing system, following yesterday's debate we have consulted. Stakeholder groups have had the opportunity to view the computer system, LIMA, which Atos Origin uses, and will have the opportunity to view again. It is very important that Atos Origin has the opportunity to learn from the feedback from interested stakeholder groups. I am advised that it will offer Peers the opportunity to view the LIMA project.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000159"></a>I do not want to labour this point, but the DWP has a strong record of investing in independent research, which is published academic research undertaken by a number of social research units around the country. There is also a huge amount of administrative data which the department collect and which are published quarterly and are available to social researchers, parliamentarians and all those concerned about the issues. The department is showing a strong commitment to learning by doing and by piloting. The Committee should welcome that. Although the amendments give us an important opportunity to have this discussion, they would not achieve what they are intended to and I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

But viewing it

The noble Baroness said that interested organisations had already viewed or had the opportunity to view the computer, but their complaint is that they, unlike myself, often have the knowledge to be able to test it. That is rather different from viewing it. As I said, I would certainly be extremely interested to see it and make up my own mind, but that is different from testing it.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000161"></a>I want to make a further point. I agree that the department does have an extremely good record on evaluating research, which is a continuing process. However, the pilots cannot be expected to go on for ever. Sooner or later there will be a 100 per cent rollout across the country of the whole ESA. It is that point which our advisers are currently worried about because however good pilots may be, when there is a 100 per cent rollout the situation in some areas is bound to be different. That is our continuing worry.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000162"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07030169000677"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> Perhaps I may clarify that point. I accept that it is important to evaluate the whole of the ESA journey. It is intended for that to happen, and it will be done by looking at the programme right from the beginning and even through to the appeals process. The evaluation will be published and made available to Members of both Houses and stakeholders. However, we must have the ESA up and running before a real evaluation can be undertaken and thus answer the questions that interested parties will have in the future about how the ESA is actually working.</p>

Members on these Benches will be pleased to take up the invitation; it is exactly what we wanted. I was also pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, make the point that the evaluation of the pilots has been useful so far, but we know that comparatively few people have been involved in the pilots and&#151;this is perhaps one of the major worries&#151;that they have been per capita the subject of a much better rate of funding and one that may be unrepresentative. While the pilots have given some clues as to what is going on, they have not been particularly clear about what is happening with regard to mental health problems, and this is the greatest worry. The early quantitative evidence from the Institute of Fiscal Studies is just that: early evidence, so we will have to watch this carefully. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000169"></a>We understand that many of the successful verdicts are a result of new evidence being submitted for consideration.

We should always remember that these important proceedings are focused finely on&#151;to use horrible, inelegant jargon&#151;the in-flow, as opposed to the stock, of claimants who are on incapacity benefit. The pilots and Pathways to Work have all been focused on new people coming into the system, approaching it for the first time and being handled under the new regime. However, in spite of our best endeavours, nothing much is being done directly to deal with those claimants who are already in the system. Many of them have been in it for a long time and many will eithersadly retire or go to the great Parliament in the sky before better arrangements can be made for their support.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000171"></a>This mechanism is an essential step change from anything that we have seen previously in 20 years of public policy in this area. Therefore, if it works, as I hope it will, it should be applied more broadly to anybody who is on the stock at the time so that they might take advantage of what is being made available to first-time claimants under the new regime after A-day in 2008. I know that some provision in the system has already been made for that, but if the power is broad enough to enable a little creative thinking while we are waiting for A-day, and we can look at how the mechanism can be made readily available to the claimants on the stock, that would be welcome.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000172"></a>I am certainly persuaded by my experience with my other colleagues who are work providers that a positive and helpful mechanism should not be restricted, as they would see it, merely to the inflow of new claimants. It is of course understandable that we need to get it up and running, that it has got to start somewhere and that this is a big enough task, but if there is to be some creative work with new pilots, can Clause 18 admit of some work that could be done between now and 2008 to see what other, new access can start to be made by those people who are marooned on the stock of incapacity benefit?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000174"></a>Noble Lords are absolutely right that the appeals process is a cornerstone of any effective benefit system. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, highlighted the questions surrounding the success rate of appeals. The department takes the success rating of appeals very seriously. We talked yesterday about it having issued new guidelines to decision-makers to improve the preparation of information for the appeals process. They specifically ask decision-makers to be more careful, and perhaps more effective, in gathering information from customers and identifying those who should be going through a reconsideration process because information about their claim has come to light which the decision-maker had not been aware of. They also improve the process of requesting further information from medical services and generally ensure that the communication of decisions to customers is more effective, making it clear that if there is any information that they feel should have been taken into account but was not, it should be passed to the decision-maker as quickly as possible. There has been an active process of advising decision-makers so that the concerns voiced about the appeals rates can be tackled.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000175"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07030169000683"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Before the Minster leaves that point, as I expect she is about to, does she have any figures on how many appellants appeal on their own behalf, rather than through organisations such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, Macmillan Cancer Relief or what have you? The request for the required extra information would often be better directed to those organisations rather than the appellant themselves.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000176"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07030169000684"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> That is an interesting point, and I shall write to the noble Lord about it. We are extremely indebted to organisations such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and Macmillan Cancer Relief, who provide an invaluable service to customers, supporting them with information and advice. I would be happy to look into that and come back to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000177"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, perhaps broadens our horizons and makes us think slightly more ambitiously about the potential impact for the success of these programmes. He refers to inflow and the customers already on incapacity benefit. We have not touched on some of the important work in understanding what can be done for current customers. I shall share with noble Lords the experience of seven of the original Pathways areas which are looking at how it can be extended to existing customers. The extension&#146;s aim is to obtain experience of whether the Pathways approach is equally effective with existing IB customers.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000178"></a>The regime is different from that for new claimants in two major respects. First, existing customers attend three mandatory work-focused interviews, as opposed to six for new or repeat customers. Secondly, personal advisers have the discretion to award a job preparation premium of &#163;20 a week, payable for a maximum of26 weeks, to existing customers in these areas if it will help them plan a return to employment and undertake

The initial extension from February 2005 to March 2006 focused on those customers who claimed up to two years before the start of the pilot&#151;so people on IB for some time. From April 2006, the mandatory work-focused interview regime has been further extended to IB claimants who began claiming between two and six years before the start of the pilots. Somerset officials will go deeper into this group by seeing all the incapacity benefit caseload within a district. That is valuable work for precisely the reasons the noble Lord has already stated. It is so useful to be able to work in such an evaluative action research-led way. If the results are positive that could be incredibly important in managing the migration of existing customers across the country.</p>

<ul><a name="07030169000600"></a>&#147;we expect that customers on income-related ESA will also have access to a range of other passported benefits, such as prescription charges or free school meals&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/2/07; cols. GC 5-6.]</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000531"></a>The amendment aims to put beyond doubt that those for whom either strand of ESA is their only household income, and who satisfy the savings threshold for means-tested ESA, are exempt from prescription charges.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000186"></a>There is so much concern about this particular passported benefit because the affordability of prescribed medication is of great concern to people with long-term health problems on low incomes. In 2001, Citizens Advice commissioned MORI to carry out a survey, which showed that 750,000 people failed to get their prescriptions dispensed because they could not afford the charge. CAB advise many clients, including those receiving contribution-based IB, who are struggling to afford prescription charges and who are unaware of the potential help available to them under the low income scheme.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000187"></a>The majority of ESA claimants will be expected to undertake work-related activity as a condition of receiving benefit; and many will need medication to manage their health in order to carry out work-related activity.

There is of course the cumbersome and intrusive NHS low income scheme route, but that has been subject to long-standing criticism for failing to meet patients&#146; needs.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000189"></a>The Health Select Committee in another place in its recent report on NHS charges called for better cross-departmental working to reduce the extent to which patients have to complete the 16-page HC1 form to receive help with prescription costs via the low income scheme, and recommended that the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health work together to extend health-charge exemptions to those on means-tested benefits so that the low income scheme can be abolished.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000190"></a>By making all low income ESA claimants exempt from prescription charges, the Government would also avoid carrying over into the new ESA regime the unfairness contained within the existing incapacity benefit system.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000191"></a>Currently, claimants with sufficient national insurance records receive contribution-based IB, which makes them ineligible for exemption from prescription charges. However, contribution-based IB and income support with a disability premium are paid at the same rate. Therefore, current rules on prescription exemptions treat people being paid identical amounts of benefit differently and disadvantage those who have previously worked.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000192"></a>I understand that the Department of Health is considering allowing ESA claimants to access free prescriptions without the need for a separate claim via the low income scheme. It would be very helpful if the Minister could say something about that, and give details of any discussions on the issue that she has had with her colleagues in the Department of Health.

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000196"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, that once you are on ESA it really does not matter whether you arrived by the route of the

You are in exactly the same position and are likely to be just as poor. Therefore, if it is right for one strand to have these passported benefits and not the other, the Minister must be able to produce a very good reason for not treating them in the same way.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000197"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, talked about the low income scheme for prescriptions, which exists for those who are not entitled to passported free ones. That scheme is not widely known about. Has the department considered advising people of its existence when they receive their first benefit cheque?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000198"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07030169000687"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for raising an important issue with her amendment. Income-related benefits are important to our customers, not only because of the income they provide, but also, as she pointed out, because they often act as a passport to entitlement to other benefits.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000199"></a>We expect the income-related strand of employment and support allowance to offer access to the same benefits that have already been discussed as income support currently does. The range of support includes, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, pointed out, free prescriptions and remission from other NHS charges, but also includes other benefits such as free school meals and smaller, yet important, schemes such as school uniform grants.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000200"></a>Additionally, customers of the income-related strand of ESA will be passported on to full housing benefit and council tax benefit, which, as noble Lords know, can make a huge difference to families&#146; income. We do not currently provide an automatic passport for someone who only receives contributory benefit. That is because entitlement to contributory benefits is not usually based on a person&#146;s level of income&#151;and the schemes we are talking about today are targeted support, meant for those most in need.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000201"></a>If someone has a low income, and is receiving incapacity benefit, or, in the future, the contribution-based strand of ESA, they may qualify for help with free NHS prescriptions and help towards other NHS charges through the low income scheme. There is a difficult balance to be struck. The noble Baroness pointed out that there is a fair amount of form-filling and inconvenience for our customers, and spoke of the risk that some may lose out on entitlements which are rightfully theirs.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000202"></a>The current system is designed to identify what other income people have so help can go where it is needed most. The challenge is to find a way of identifying those who are on low income, whether they receive contributory or income-related benefit, without the need for all the forms and processes, and ensuring that the information that we have is up to date as people&#146;s circumstances change, without our being overly bureaucratic or intrusive.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000203"></a>As has already been commented on, the Government&#146;s response to the Health Committee&#146;s report on NHS charges gave an undertaking to explore the possibilities of access to free prescriptions without the need to make a separate low income scheme claim. This will  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC267"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be looked at as part of the overall review of prescription charges. The Government will report the outcome of this review by this summer.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000204"></a>Additionally, to make it easier for customers to meet the cost of an annual payment certificate, I am pleased to say that the Government have already agreed to make available the option of payment through monthly direct debits from July 2007. This has been debated for many years and many organisations have campaigned for it. At the same time, four-month prepayment certificates will be replaced by lower-cost three-month prepayment certificates.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000205"></a>I stress the difference between the income-related and contributory ESA. For a person to receive income-related ESA, an income assessment is made of them. For contributory ESA, no income assessment of that person will have been made. They could be very wealthy and receive ESA on a contributory basis. That is the rationale for a requirement being placed on them to fulfil a low-income test to get free prescriptions.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000206"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07030169000688"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I said that the amendment related to those who received either strand of ESA as their only household income and who satisfied the savings threshold for means-tested ESA. I presume that that would not be someone who is very wealthy.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000207"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07030169000689"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I appreciate that point. I was trying to make a distinction; namely, that to obtain free prescriptions, a claimant or patient would have had to have gone through a low income test, whereas someone who receives the contributory part of ESA would not have done so. If the noble Baroness&#146;s criteria were fulfilled, that would in theory be the case, but the person would still not have been through the low income test which is required for free NHS prescriptions.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000208"></a>However, we are looking at the matter, particularly given our desire to reduce bureaucracy and form-filling and to promote uptake of free prescriptions for all those who are entitled to them. I assure the noble Baroness that the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions take the matter very seriously, and discussions are under way. We look forward to the outcome of the review in the summer. I hope that noble Lords will withdraw the amendment on the basis of this discussion.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000247"></a>I strongly believe that the Bill must be amended to provide a remedy for the hardship caused to single, under-25 year-olds since the introduction over10 years ago of a restriction on the amount of housing benefit that they are eligible for. There is indisputable evidence that the single room rent restriction on housing benefit creates shortfalls between benefit received and contractual rent for many young people. This has been shown to lead to financial hardship, rent arrears, eviction and even homelessness among young people. Those affected by the single room rent are forced to spend months or even years sleeping on friends&#146; sofas&#151;a lifestyle that inevitably impacts on their chances in life and later, therefore, on any of their children.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000248"></a>One of the most positive features of the local housing allowance pilots that we have discussed has been the reduction in shortfalls for those over 25 years old. However, as a result of the single room rent, which is carried over into the local housing allowance, albeit with a slightly more generous definition, this improvement has not been as marked for single claimants aged under 25, who have seen an average reduction of just &#163;3 per week&#151;from &#163;30 to &#163;27. This group already faced the most severe shortfalls under the existing provisions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000249"></a>I recognise that unemployed people on benefit should not be better off than those in work. However, equally, we should not be prepared to tolerate a benefits system that denies vulnerable young people the opportunity of a home. I continue to believe that the single room rent should not be carried over into the new local housing allowance. The Minister&#146;s department estimates the cost of abolishing the single room rent to be some &#163;20 million a year. My amendment would anticipate that if half the current claimants were over the age of 21, the cost would be around &#163;10 million a year, a reasonable sum, when viewed in the context of the overall housing benefit budget.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000250"></a>The amendment, and I hope I do not sound immodest in saying so, gives the Government a golden opportunity to permit more young people to have a stable home, so that they can gain and retain stable employment, thus being in a position to establish stable relationships and eventually start a stable family&#151;and breaking for some of them a cycle of deprivation that has continued for generations.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000251"></a>Underpinning this Bill is the notion of rights and responsibilities. The Minister referred at Second Reading to the principle of fairness. With your Lordships&#146; permission I would like to apply those principles to this amendment. Have we been discharging our responsibilities towards our children and young people? There is much evidence to suggest not. Please consider all the work done by my noble friend Lord Northbourne over the years in drawing our attention to the deficit in parenting in many of our families. The leader of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition recently highlighted these problems in relation to crime.</p>

When the noble Lord, Lord Warner, was head of the Youth Justice Board, he found that the introduction of parenting orders was the most effective intervention in preventing re-offending, that it was economic and that many of the parents upon whom this was imposed responded by saying, &#147;Why could we not have had this help before?&#148;. They welcomed it. More recently the Government&#146;s Respect Action Plan has put great emphasis on improving parenting skills.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000254"></a>What is the implication of what I have said? Sadly, very many of our young people have not had a satisfactory upbringing. Their development is to some degree delayed. They need additional support as they make the transition to adulthood. I do not wish to try the patience of the Grand Committee, so will not describe the cases of some of these young people. I would urge noble Lords to consider speaking with some of the young people at, for example, Centrepoint, YMCA or Foyer to hear of their experience of housing and of their earlier histories, if at all possible. Between now and Report I would much appreciate the opportunity to speak with the official and, perhaps, the Minister involvedin this issue to understand better the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000255"></a>To repeat, we have disappointed many of our children; we have left undone that which we should have done. We have failed in our duty&#151;our responsibility&#151;to provide an environment in which families can thrive. By agreeing to the amendment tabled by my noble friend, we can make good our failure to some extent, by providing a stable home to more of our young people as they make their transition to adulthood&#151;where they are more likely to be able to hold down a job and to gain stable enduring relationships, leading in turn to a stable base for their children&#146;s lives.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000256"></a>The Minister referred at Second Reading to fairness&#151;parity of treatment of young people. There is strength of course in what he says. On balance, does the demerit of violating that principle outweigh the merit of making up for the impoverished childhoods of many of the young people likely to benefit from this change? A young person in a classroom may feel it unfair that another child receives the special individual attention of a classroom assistant. If in the short term such special treatment leads to that needy child being able to read and to be a full contributing member of that class, do not his peers benefit? In the long term do we not all benefit from that kind of unfairness? I beg to move.</p>

First, I thank the noble Earl for stepping into the breach left by the noble Lord, Lord Best, and, if I may mix my metaphors, doing much of the heavy lifting for me on this amendment. He made the case in principle very well indeed, very strongly relying, as I do, on the advice and expertise of Shelter and Citizens Advice.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000258"></a>On Amendment No. 104, we took the view that in order to have a full debate in Committee it would be a good idea for both amendments to be considered. Our option is slightly stronger, to abolish this unfair and discriminatory legislation completely; but the noble Earl&#146;s amendment is certainly half or three-quarters of a loaf and we are essentially singing from the same hymn-sheet.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000259"></a>As it stands, the Bill will provide tenants under 25 with a considerably lower rate of housing benefit than everyone else. If the single room rent were abolished, which our amendments would achieve, we would finally have a situation where everyone, no matter what age, had access to housing benefits on the same basis.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000260"></a>In Standing Committee in the Commons, the Minister, Anne McGuire, was asked how the Government could continue with a housing benefit regime that created shortfalls that were so severe that young people faced rent arrears and eviction. In her reply, she said,</p>
<ul><a name="07030169000601"></a>&#147;local authorities have the discretionary housing payment scheme that allows them to give additional financial support when a person&#146;s situation is not covered by the local housing allowance&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee A, 2/11/06; col. 426.]</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000533"></a>That is no answer. It almost accepts that the position is unfair, but effectively states that there is a sticking plaster solution and the sticking plaster in this case often runs out well before the end of the financial year in many authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has already referred to a postcode lottery in other areas and there is certainly a postcode lottery here.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000261"></a>Ms McGuire went on to acknowledge that the LHA had done nothing to increase the supply of accommodation that young claimants were supposed to live in. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000566"></a>&#147;All hon. Members who have spoken have said that they are concerned about the supply of shared accommodation. I confirm that in the pathfinder areas the supply of shared accommodation has not changed in any respect&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee A, 2/11/06; col. 428.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000262"></a>I touched on a little bit of history in my Second Reading speech, but it is equally relevant now. This restriction&#151;single room rent&#151;was introduced in October 1996, just before this Government came to power, in the face of combined opposition from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. It was made quite clear by the then Labour Front-Bench spokesman that the response of landlords was,</p>
<ul><a name="07030169000602"></a>&#147;likely to be to withdraw from providing accommodation for young people&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/6/96; col. 622.]</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000534"></a>Just for the record, Tony Blair, John Prescott and John Hutton were among those who voted against the proposals.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000263"></a>The single room rent means that young people who lose their jobs are almost immediately faced with the prospect of losing their homes. It forces them to focus their attention on finding a new place to live, when their time would be much better spent trying to find alternative employment. Rather than acting as a work incentive, the single room rate is actually a barrier to dealing with youth unemployment. We agree. We do not believe that that is what the Government want and we invite them to end this gross injustice.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000264"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07030169000700"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I am delighted to be able to join the deliberations on the Bill. If this change of voice also changes the harmonics of the debate, I guess that it is only temporary. On this side of the Grand Committee we find ourselves in tune with the Government&#146;s proposals and we are unable to support the amendments. Despite strong lobbying from many organisations such as Citizens Advice, we hold to our view that it would be a damaging state of affairs if at the margin young people on benefits such as housing benefit were able to afford a standard of living, such as being able to live alone, that many employed younger people who are their peers and who have lifted themselves above the benefit threshold, cannot enjoy. In our view, both the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best, passionately moved by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and that of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, run counter to the thrust of the Bill, which aims to build on Pathways to Work.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000265"></a>Of course, the circumstances of a 24 year-old can vary hugely, as do their housing requirements. We have tabled a later amendment to address one of these unusual circumstances. But very few young people start their independent employed life living alone, rather than with family or friends. These amendments could provide a significant disincentive to seek higher wages, a better job, or even a job at all, by offering a housing benefit that would be lost by taking such action. Self-interest and self-motivation would be working in opposite directions&#151;this at a time in life when we should be encouraging people to seek independent living and freedom from the system.</p>

I do so specifically as his first duty is to support the Government&#146;s position. I urge him to continue in that Front-Bench role for as long as he possibly can. I am pleased that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is back among us and speaking, as ever, with passion on the cause of young people.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000267"></a>I am grateful that we have the opportunity to contribute to an important debate on the future of the single room rent, or the shared room rate as it will become under the local housing allowance.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000268"></a>I shall deal with the two amendments separately. In essence, Amendment No. 103A would seek to restrict the application of the single room rent only to those aged under 21. It is, in a sense, a compromise amendment between the status quo and the argument to completely abolish the single room rent.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC274"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0005.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000269"></a>The proposed change to the upper age limit for the single room rent might seem small but, in fact, it attacks the root of the principle behind the single room rent. The single room rent applies for those aged under 25 and not for those who are older, because there is a clear split between those aged 18 to 24 and those aged 25 and over.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70301-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000270"></a>The aim of the single room rent is to set a level of housing benefit that enables a customer to access accommodation of a type similar to that of their working peers. This is therefore not a compromise based on evidence; with respect, it is purely arbitrary. For example, we know that those aged 18 to 24 have average earnings of about two-thirds of those aged 25 and over. That means that generally there is a real difference between the accommodation which a working person under 25 can afford and that which a working person aged 25 and over can afford. It is therefore only fair that we reflect that in housing benefit levels.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000271"></a>However, there is no such difference in the average earnings of those aged 18 to 20 and those aged 21 to 24. There is, therefore, no logical reason why those aged 21 to 24 should not have their housing benefit restricted by the single room rent but those under the age of 21 should. I suggest that there is an inconsistency in the approach. This arbitrary compromise runs counter to the spirit of the rest of the Bill of weighing an individual&#146;s rights and responsibilities relative to their capabilities. If we were to accept this amendment, we would simply create a band of people aged between21 and 24 who would be able to afford accommodation that many of their working peers would not. There is no evidence-based reason why the single room rent should end at 21; there is, however, such a reason why it should end at 25.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000272"></a>Amendment No. 104 would remove any age-related restriction on a customer&#146;s maximum housing benefit. In particular, the amendment would abolish the single room rent, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, made clear.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000273"></a>As the debate on the single room rent has developed, the accusation has been levelled that the Government are sticking to the principle of the single room rent at the expense of the realities of life for customers of the benefit. We disagree with that view and we stand by the principle of the single room rent.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000274"></a>Three-quarters of single young people without children who pay their own rent and receive no housing benefit currently live in shared accommodation. We have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers&#146; money is always spent in a way that is not only fair but also reflective of the realities faced by all people, not just those on benefit. So when three-quarters of the same group who do not receive benefits share, I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask the same of those who do receive benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000275"></a>However, just because we are strongly wedded to the principle of the single room rent, that does not mean that we ignore the needs of the more vulnerable customers who receive that rent. It should also be noted that young people who are severely disabled and certain young people leaving care under the age of 22 are exempt from the single room rent restriction. Those who are in supported accommodation or social housing are also not subject to this restriction.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000276"></a>For some people, it will be hard for them to share a house, but perhaps I may draw a parallel here with an earlier part of the Bill. For some who have been on incapacity benefit or who will be on the new ESA, it will be hard to move back into work. Hard, I suggest, but not impossible. In the past, those for whom it has been hard to move into work were just written off. But in Part 1 of the Bill we are making efforts to change this and bring them back into the mainstream, to bring them out of exclusion. Since 1997, this Government have had unprecedented success in improving the prospects for young people. Through the New Deal for young people nearly 700,000 18 to 24 year-olds have been helped into work. With the single room rent we have a choice: do we go against the grain of all this success by exempting them from it, increasing their out-of-work income and so extending the poverty trap? Do we say, &#147;It is hard for you to make the bonds and social networks to learn to live in shared accommodation, so you do not have to try&#148;? That, I suggest, would push them out of the mainstream and reinforce the path to exclusion. Or do we include them and ask them to participate in a way of living that is so common to their non benefit-receiving peers? We believe that this is the path that provides them with the best chance of escaping the trap of benefit dependency.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000277"></a>I should like to pick up on one or two specific points that have been made. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked about the cost, and cited the figure of &#163;10 million. I suggest that this is a minimum. If customer behaviour were to change as a result, the costs could be many times that. Certainly I am happy to meet with the noble Earl, together with officials or otherwise. We must set that in train before we reach the Report stage. I shall ask for that to be followed up with urgency. The noble Earl also referred to the UNICEF report. This may not be the occasion to debate it in depth, but it is clear that quite a lot of the data on which that report is based are somewhat out of date. We are not complacent. Indeed, the noble Earl did acknowledge the progress the Government have made in helping young people, particularly on long-term unemployment rates which for young people are almost extinct.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000278"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, spoke as though there was no possibility of anyone in receipt of the single room rate being able to access shared accommodation. The single room rate, as the local housing allowance, will be set by rent officers based on the actual situation in the particular locality. It will be set at the medium level. Logically, therefore, it would be possible for at least half the accommodation in that population of opportunities to be available to people in receipt of the single room rate. I accept that there is an issue generally about availability both for those on the single room rate and for those on the housing allowance in any event, but I do not think it is right to assume that no one receiving the single room rate would be able to access accommodation in the way he suggested. I will not quote the detailed figures in terms of the difference in earnings levels, but I think I have touched on that.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000279"></a>The noble Lord also referred to discretionary housing payments and said that the system is a postcode lottery. In fact, since their introduction, the discretionary

Perhaps the Minister would care to withdraw his response to my comment that it is a postcode lottery. Clearly it is a lottery as to whether you happen to be living in an area where the budget has run out before the end of the year. Perhaps he could confirm that.</p>

Given the comments that have been made and notwithstanding the strength of feeling that lies behind the amendments, I would ask noble Lords not to press them for the reasons I have outlined.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000284"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07030169000706"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I wonder whether the Minister can help me just a fraction. I note from a Written Answer in another place on 15 May last year, at col. 637W of <I>Hansard</I>, that the number of housing benefit recipients assessed under the single room rent scheme in Great Britain has been dropping quite staggeringly over recent years. I accept that in the past three or four years the figure has levelled off at between 10,500 and 12,000; none the less, can the Minister give any reason for that, and can he say whether the figure of &#163;10 million, which the noble Earl produced, is the department&#146;s understanding of what the amendment would cost?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000285"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07030169000707"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The noble Lord is right. In 1997, something like 33,000 people were accessing single room rent and the figure is now about 12,000. That is roughly the magnitude of the change. There is some evidence that it is partly attributable to the fact that we have many more young people in employment. That is testimony to the success of the Government&#146;s economic policy, which has helped many more young people into work and of course has led to their not needing to access the benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000286"></a>The cost was correctly stated by the noble Earl, provided that customer behaviour does not alter as a result of the change. If it did change, we consider that it could be many times that figure. That needs to be put in context.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000288"></a>There is obviously an issue of principle here, which we have discussed at some length. I shall leave the matter of discretionary housing payments to the noble Lord, but it is clear that the budget is cash-limited in each authority and that, in many authorities, the money runs out long before the end of the financial year. When he has had a chance to check, I should be grateful if he could confirm that to me.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000289"></a>Basically, as I said, we are talking about an issue of principle. I heard all the arguments that the Minister produced about the relative earnings of young people of different ages. I thought that he set it out very well. I should have thought that all the arguments , circumstances and ratios were exactly the same in 1996, when his party was completely against this measure, and I did not hear a single suggestion from him about what had changed since.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000291"></a>One question which I did not raise but which I know my noble friend Lord Best would have done concerns housing availability. We have 100,000 homeless children living in temporary accommodation in this country&#151;perhaps the highest level since records of this kind began. There is a tremendous shortageof housing, but one area where there is some degree of over-capacity is in single rooms, where people have invested in housing and new build and it has not proved as popular as they imagined it would be. Would this provide a possibility for more young people to get accommodation?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000292"></a>On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to his local newspaper, where he saw advertisements for housing stating, &#147;No DSS&#148;. Clearly, where there is a great shortage of housing and landlords know that young people cannot give the same guarantee of payment as older people, that may well inhibit them from taking on young people. It will be interesting to hear the Government&#146;s understanding of what will be the impact on opening access to accommodation to young people.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000293"></a>Many young people whom I come across do not necessarily have the benefit of &#147;leaving care&#148; status, but they have serious problems. I mentioned the research undertaken by the Youth Justice Board on young people in custody on remand. They have such difficulties with the relationships with their peers and with their parents. Young people with whom I have worked over several months are difficult people to live with. One man of whom I can think is charming for

<p><a name="07030169000294"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000295"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07030169000710"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach</b> moved AmendmentNo. 103B:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000567"></a> Clause 29 , page 20, line 16, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000568"></a>&#147;( ) Regulations specified in subsection (2) above may provide that the appropriate maximum housing benefit and weekly amount of housing benefit payable may be reduced in respect of non-dependants residing with the claimant, but that&#151;</p>
</ul> (a) any such regulations must provide that no non-dependant deduction will apply for non-dependants in receipt of income support, job seekers allowance (income based) and pension credit, and (b) the total reduction attributable to non-dependants must not reduce the housing benefit payable below 50 per cent of the appropriate maximum housing benefit.&#148; 
<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000296"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments, which are intended to probe any government intention to reform the non-dependent deduction regime, were suggested to us by Shelter and Citizens Advice. Those organisations have first-hand experience of the hardship that those deductions can cause. The effects can include pushing recipients of housing benefit into rent arrears, debt and possible eviction. They have also seen extreme cases where they have led to family breakdown and homelessness. The deductions also fall primarily on those least prepared to bear them. They disproportionately affect the elderly, those receiving other benefits and single parents&#151;a point that the Government will want to consider carefully when pursuing their targets to reduce child poverty.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000297"></a>Of course, we do not argue with the principle of the policy. Adults who are able to should be expected to pay a contribution to the household in which they live, but that principle should not be pursued to excess. When there is an incentive for many low-income benefit claimant customers to leave a household and move to a single tenancy where they can claim housing benefit separately, the cost to the taxpayer is considerably greater&#151;a clear sign that reform of the system is well overdue.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000298"></a>Many organisations believe that those deductions are unrealistic in the expectations that they place on the recipients of housing benefit. Many of those people find it difficult, if not impossible, to make up the deduction from their income of the non-dependent person, resulting in parents making a choice between evicting a child or someone in full-time education or an economically active dependant, or being evicted themselves.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000299"></a>The complexity of the system is also a key reason that so many negative effects come from such a superficially reasonable policy. There are six different rates of non-dependent deduction, depending on the income of the non-dependent. There are also numerous exemptions based on certain types of education in  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which he or she may be or benefits that he or she may be receiving, combined with age criteria. Simplification of the system was recommended by the Social Security Select Committee five years ago and I wonder whether the Minister can explain whether the Government now have any plans to reform the system, given the reform that they are currently pursuing of other parts of housing benefit. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000300"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07030169000711"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I may have chided the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, slightly on the previous amendment but on this one I think that he has raised some very fair questions. We support the thinking behind them and we look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s answer.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000301"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07030169000712"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Amendments Nos. 103B and 103C seek to amend Clause 29. Amendment No. 104A is a new clause concerning non-dependant deductions. I propose to address AmendmentNo. 103C first, as both Amendments Nos. 103B and 104A are about the non-dependant deduction scheme.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000302"></a>Amendment No. 103C would effectively provide that certain categories of people could be eligible for an extra room under the local housing allowance. I certainly sympathise with the admirable intentions behind the amendment, but I hope to be able to reassure noble Lords that it is not necessary. From a legislative point of view, under Section 175(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 we already have powers to exercise the regulation-making powers so as to make different provision for different groups of people. In the majority of cases, care for those who need it is provided by a person who is a permanent member of their household. In these cases, under the local housing allowance, the carer would already be included when the local authority calculated how many rooms the customer was eligible for.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000303"></a>Of course, customers who are disabled will often require more support with housing than customers who are not. I fully appreciate that. Disabled customers have a diverse variety of extra needs, and support must be tailored and be specific and responsive to an individual&#146;s needs. I suggest that the local housing allowance structure is not the place to provide that support. That is why the department has a wide range of disability benefits, all designed to meet customers&#146; different needs.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000304"></a>It is also for this reason that we have the discretionary housing payment scheme. That is a matter that I hesitate to return to, and I commit to responding more fully to the point on which the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, pressed me. This is a more flexible system that enables a local authority to target more help to those customers who need it. Because it is discretionary, the local authority can tailor additional help to the level that the customer needs. Changing the local housing allowance so that it became a more complicated, specifically targeted benefit would undermine the aims of housing benefit reform.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000305"></a>Both Amendments Nos. 103B and 104A relate to non-dependant deductions. It has long been the established policy that adults who live in the household of a person in receipt of income-related benefits should  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC280"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contribute towards the costs of their accommodation. It is right that that should be so, because the taxpayer should not indirectly subsidise the accommodation costs of non-dependants. I think that the noble Lord accepted that point when he moved his amendment. Standard deductions are based on the non-dependant&#146;s gross income level. This avoids subjecting the non-dependant to a detailed means test, which would be impractical for local authorities and the department to administer.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000306"></a>The amendments mean that some people who at present attract a deduction would not do so. Those who would not attract a deduction would be the following: anyone of working age who is 25 or over and in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance; anyone in non-remunerative work&#151;that is, working less than 16 hours per week; and anyone in remunerative work whose income is under &#163;101 per week.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000307"></a>Currently, non-dependants in receipt of pension credit and non-dependants aged under 25 who are in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance do not attract a deduction. For non-dependants on income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, the scheme reflects the fact that weekly allowances in those benefits rise at the age of 25, currently by &#163;11.95, so it is reasonable to expect someone on those benefits to contribute towards household costs from that point.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000308"></a>Regarding non-dependants on pension credit, a review of the scheme was undertaken in 2005 and changes were made to reflect the needs of pensioners.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000309"></a>The second part of Amendment No. 103B would in effect impose a ceiling on the level of non-dependant deductions that could be taken from a person&#146;s housing benefit. I appreciate that the intention of this is to limit the effect of non-dependant deductions on the tenant&#146;s housing benefit, but it would also mean that the level of contributions expected from non-dependants on high incomes would be capped. That cannot be fair, especially to non-dependants on lower incomes, and indeed to the taxpayer, who would be subsidising the housing costs of those non-dependants.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000310"></a>On Amendment No. 104A, under the current scheme, dependants who are not in remunerative work and who are earning less than &#163;101 per week attract a &#163;7.40 per week deduction from the tenants' housing benefit and a &#163;2.30 a week deduction from council tax benefit. It is not clear from the amendment what is the intention for non-dependants who are in non-remunerative work and are in receipt of income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance. I assume that the noble Lord intended no deduction to apply for anyone in non-remunerative work. If that is right, that would mean that a non-dependent who was on income support who was not working would continue to attract a reduction, but a non-dependent who was on income support and doing some part-time work would not.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000311"></a>Also, the lower-rated deduction in council tax benefit, assuming that there would be a read across, applies to incomes below &#163;157. If the intention is to split the current lower income band in two, and the divide then being &#163;101, that would mean that the current lower  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC281"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rate of deduction would apply to incomes between &#163;101 and &#163;157. If it is intended to move the current bandwidth from &#163;157 to &#163;101, that would mean that about 10,000 non-dependants with incomes between those figures would attract increased deductions up from &#163;2.30 to &#163;4.60 per week.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000312"></a>It is important to remember that the Government have frozen non-dependent reduction rates since 2000. Indeed, we dealt with that in the uprating just a couple of days ago, when they were frozen again for next year&#151;although the income bandwidths, which determine the rate of deduction have been increased each year. That is beneficial both to householders and to the non-dependants themselves. Any reform of the scheme must take account the overall rationale for it. The Government's view remains that it is right to expect a contribution from non-dependants. The burden to the taxpayer must also be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000313"></a>I am conscious that a few complicated calculations and figures were flying around in that response, but I thought that it was important to put them onthe record. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I was grateful that, in his reply, the Minister acknowledged that there canbe circumstances in which families are affected unsatisfactorily and I urge him, in the annual review of these processes, which he mentioned, to take account of the impact of the deductions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000321"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise for my lack of familiarity with the proceedings. Again, the amendment has been suggested by Shelter and Citizens Advice&#151;so it comes from a source that is common with the previous amendment&#151;to probe an aspect of housing benefit that they feel is not working as well as might be expected.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000322"></a>Those organisations feel that the current arrangements for providing extra funding for those on housing allowance who have special needs due to a disability are inadequate. In particular, they point out that the mechanism by which the Government attempt to meet these needs, the discretionary housing payments scheme that the Minister has referred to, is not enough. For example, an applicant for these discretionary payments must apply every three months at a minimum, preventing them from being able to guarantee to a private landlord that they will be able to meet the full amount of their rent for the whole six months of a standard tenancy.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000323"></a>Of course, other benefits or exemptions are made available&#151;for example, in non-dependent deductions and the single room rent&#151;but still the statistics show that disabled people find it considerably harder than non-disabled people receiving housing allowance to rent in the private sector. A case history has been given to us about the problems which faced a wheelchair user seeking a suitable place to live. She found it difficult due to the lack of properties that met her needs as a wheelchair user. Finally, a two-bedroom private let became available in February 2004 that was suitable for her needs; the second bedroom was essential to enable the overnight support she required to live independently.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000324"></a>She lived in this property for about a year and a half. However, during that period, there was a continuous discrepancy between the amount of rent being asked for and the amount of housing benefit she received&#151;approximately &#163;160 per month. It was clear that she was only receiving rent for a one-bedroom property. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the situation, including making discretionary housing payment applications, the situation was never completely resolved. There was still a major shortfall in her rent, and she was threatened with eviction on several occasions. This was extremely stressful for her and affected her health. Despite wanting to remain in the flat, it became obvious that this would be impossible for her. She was fortunate that another property became available in a housing association, but this was sheer good luck. Otherwise, she would probably have become homeless and would certainly be living in unsuitable accommodation.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000325"></a>I offer that as an illustration. Can the Minister inform us if the Government have any plans to reform this part of the benefit system in the future? I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

To emphasise, a member of the household is the carer for most who need and have them. They perform an incredibly valuable service for the community. They would obviously be included in the household and the evaluation that would be made of the type of accommodation, number of bedrooms and so on that should be supported through the local housing allowance. If it is a member of the household, that is already catered for.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000327"></a>Where that situation does not exist, there are a range of benefits. Discretionary housing payments might be a part of that, but I will not go through the whole list of benefits available for those with disabilities who need support again. That is the best way to do it, rather than a range of specific exemptions and changes in the new system. Notwithstanding that, one is obviously disturbed to hear the particular case that the noble Lord cited, and pleased that there was an outcome and that there are registered social landlords in the community providing the sort of service which was happily a solution to this problem. Local authorities are obviously active in doing that. I am conscious that this is a fairly general response, but the specific solution to the circumstances that the noble Lord has instanced should not be met by adjusting the approach to the local housing allowance.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000337"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 104C, 104D, 104E, 104F, 105, 106, 106A and 107&#151;there is a grouping for you. These amendments deal with the controversial government policy of reducing housing benefit for those who refuse rehabilitation after being evicted for anti-social behaviour. The Government have admitted that they expect the number of people whose behaviour is bad enough to warrant this sanction to be tiny. We think that it will be closer to zero. We feel that these powers are disproportionate and even counter-productive and will have such a potentially damaging effect on any innocent members in the affected family that they will never be used, so their inclusion is unnecessary. I am glad that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has also expressed concern about the clause, reflecting the seriousness of the sanctions and the enormous harm that they could cause.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000338"></a>This is not the place to discuss in detail the Government&#146;s respect agenda, but we might be excused for thinking that these proposals are included for show. Maybe the Government are right&#151;you may need a stick to coerce difficult cases&#151;but a lot depends on the quality of the carrot. I welcome the theme of support and getting alongside people in such situations, but success needs trust and trust needs nurturing. Draconian action does not build trust&#151;indeed, it can destroy it.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000339"></a>These amendments have been tabled to explore whether the Government would consider modifying the powers, which up to now they have insisted on pursuing in full. The imposition of a 30 per cent benefit reduction on a recipient who has been identified as in hardship is excessive. The shortfall between the benefit and the rent would have to be made up from income support, driving the recipient below the poverty line. The 100 per cent reduction in benefit proposed by the Government in some cases is also extremely harsh. We have therefore suggested that reductions be limited to 50 per cent in all cases and to 10 per cent in cases of hardship. These sanctions would also be time-limited to a much greater extent than in the Bill. Our final amendment is aimed at ensuring some transparency in the implementation of the sanctions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000340"></a>In the debate on Part 1, my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale sought assurances that the Government did not intend to introduce potential sanctions without providing commensurate support to give claimant customers the opportunity to change their behaviour and avoid losing their benefit. Can the Minister explain why that sensible principle is not being applied? The Government are introducing new sanctions but have refused to expand the support available for rehabilitation. Many organisations have expressed concern that existing services designed to aid rehabilitation for drug or alcohol dependency, and so on, are not equipped to provide the rehabilitation service that the Government have promised. If the claimant customer has failed to engage with the rehabilitation services partly due to his lack of capacity, do the Government intend to punish him anyway? Would it not be far more appropriate to move such a claimant customer closer to the rehabilitation services?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000341"></a>I also have a great deal of sympathy with a couple of the other amendments in the group. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to add my name to Amendment No. 105, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, with which I wholly agree. We have had many representations from mental health charities that are concerned that those suffering from a mental disability may be subjected to eviction and benefit reduction because of a failure to diagnose their condition and approach their anti-social behaviour appropriately. I hope that the Minister will listen to those concerns and will keep an open mind on how the sanctions will be imposed. The organisations that have been lobbying us on the powers are certainly not vulnerable to the charge of ignoring the needs of people who suffer from anti-social behaviour, because many of their clients are those same people. I look forward to hearing how the Minister considers that the worst effects of the sanctions will be avoided. I beg to move.</p>

The clause allows for pilots of measures to cut or stop housing benefit following eviction for anti-social behaviour. Let us be clear. We on these Benches are determined to deal with anti-social behaviour. There are many effective ways of doing so, some of which we have developed in our local authorities. We support effective ways of dealing with the problem, but this is not one of them. For us even to consider accepting the clause it must contain a sunset provision, as we have proposed in Amendment No. 107, which would ensure that regulations under the clause would cease to have effect after January 2012. A very similar amendment, with one change, was tabled by my colleague Danny Alexander in the Commons.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000343"></a>I shall address some key points raised by the Minister in Committee in the Commons, which we have dealt with in our rewording. He said that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="07030169000603"></a>&#147;intend to commence the pilots for the proposal as soon as is practical&#151;in the winter of 2007-08&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee A, 2/11/06; col. 464.]</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000535"></a>The Government were talking about two years only. Our amendment in the Commons, supported by the Conservatives, introduced a sunset clause that would take effect after January 2010. The Government said that the difficulty with that was that it left no flexibility on the start time. We were not entirely convinced by that argument, but in the spirit of compromise and taking the Minister&#146;s objections at face value we have changed the date to January 2012, which offers the Government the flexibility that they need with ample time to conduct the pilots for this measure.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000344"></a>The Minister in the Commons, replying to my honourable friend Danny Alexander, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000572"></a>&#147;The hon. Gentleman would be proposing a sunset clause without knowing when sunrise was going to take place, so I ask him to withdraw the amendment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee A, 2/11/06; col. 464.]</p>

<p><a name="07030169000536"></a>I thought that was rather a clever phrase. Now we do know when sunrise is to take place and that is why we have given this a full breathing space, if you like. It is essential that there is full evaluation of these proposals with parliamentary debate before a full rollout. We cannot just give the Government the discretion that would allow them to take a view on the evaluations before deciding whether to go ahead. We discussed yesterday the issue of the Government being the judge and jury in their own case. This would be another example of that if the Bill went through unamended.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000345"></a>The noble Lord on this side has already mentioned that it is believed that a small number of people will be involved. That concerns me because, if it does involve only a small number, which I agree is probably likely, why is the measure there at all? It is pretty obvious: it is in order to catch the headlines. Even so, however small the number, if they are affected by a severe measure such as this&#151;one which we believe will have a disproportionately damaging effect on a larger number of people&#151;it is still wrong.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000346"></a>We have been lobbied by many organisations about the huge impact that this will have on families and children. Tenants and families who are removed are likely to be placed in insecure and temporary environments which are unlikely to help rehabilitation. The Child Poverty Action Group says that,</p>
<ul><a name="07030169000604"></a>&#147;these proposals could result in families with children being made street homeless, or children being taken into care. There is no protection for the claimants judged to be anti-social either from social stigma or from the poverty these proposals will cause. There is no requirement in the Bill for the interests of children affected to be considered when sanctions are applied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07030169000537"></a>We really are talking about a proposal to visit, in many cases, the sins of the fathers on the children:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07030169000573"></a>&#147;The risk that families with children could be made homeless is contrary to the Government&#146;s stated aim to eradicate child poverty in a generation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000347"></a>We are also concerned that these powers discriminate between people who are in receipt of housing benefit and those who are not. After all, homeowners and tenants who are not in receipt of housing benefit are also perfectly capable of behaving in ways that are considered anti-social. Why are housing benefit claimants being picked out and stigmatised? Further, as the noble Lord on this side also pointed out, mental health problems make this whole provision exceptionally difficult. Untreated mental illness can appear to the rest of us to be anti-social behaviour. Some 18 per cent of ASBOs are given to people with mental illness, but someone behaving anti-socially as a result of mental illness requires a different intervention from someone behaving anti-socially as a result of ill will. For example, someone who hears voices may play loud music at night in order to quell them. The right intervention in that case would be to offer them a pair of headphones, not to sanction them with a reduction in housing benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000348"></a>The Government also talked in the Commons Standing Committee about the Dundee Families Project and the positive effect that it has had on people who they think would be caught by this provision. They talked about the importance of rehabilitation in changing the lives of families whose behaviour was unacceptable, but the project did not involve any form of benefits  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC287"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sanction. It pointed to the importance of improved services for rehabilitation, not quick-fix legislation. So, in trying to look tough on anti-social behaviour, the Government are bringing forward an idea which runs the very real risk of creating the conditions that will breed more anti-social behaviour.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000349"></a>Our proposal is fair and sensible. We are not stopping the Government from going ahead with their pilots, although we have grave reservations about them, but we do say that a pilot should only be rolled out via primary legislation following full and robust evaluation. We are giving the Government the chance to come back to us at a later date if the pilots really work. They are always talking about &#147;what works&#148;. Let us see whether this works, and then let all of us judge whether it works and not let just the Government decide. Otherwise, I am afraid, we are talking about another nasty New Labour headline-grabbing stunt.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000350"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07030169000723"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> This has a history, does it not? It started in the housing Green Paper published in 2000, which acknowledged that it would be difficult to reduce or withdraw housing benefit from a claimant guilty of anti-social behaviour without it impacting adversely on innocent members of the family. I shall be extremely interested in the Minister&#146;s response as to how that thinking has now changed.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000351"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07030169000724"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> These amendments seek to ensure that disabilities and health issues are taken into account before a household is served with a warning notice; to reduce the length and severity of the sanction; to ensure that support offered to the household is appropriate; to introduce a right to independent review of the actions set out in the sanction warning notice; and to ensure that pilots regarding the sanctioning of housing benefit end in January 2012.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000352"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with AmendmentsNos. 105 and 106. We appreciate the concern that people with health issues should not be unfairly treated because their condition is not recognised or taken into account; hence, we already have sufficient safeguards in place to address this concern. Many health conditions will not affect a person&#146;s behaviour or hinder their engagement with rehabilitation. The health issues that may be most relevant include mental ill health, alcohol and drug addiction. It is these health issues that may affect the person&#146;s capacity to engage with support.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000353"></a>Post eviction, when support is offered and the household refuses to engage, an anti-social behaviour co-ordinator will consider whether a sanction is appropriate. This decision will be taken in discussion with relevant agencies. Exactly which agencies become involved will depend on the circumstances of the household and may include the police, social services, mental health agencies, children&#146;s services, housing managers, education or the Family Intervention Project.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000354"></a>Amendment No. 105 would place a duty on local authorities to liaise with health services. This amendment is not necessary and is impractical. The term &#147;health services&#148; could encompass hospitals, GPs, psychiatrists, physiotherapists, dentists and many others. It would  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require local authorities to contact a large number of services in every case, not all of which would be relevant. To make the amendment workable and compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Data Protection Act, we would need to limit liaison to relevant areas of the health service. In addition, the amendment places no duty on relevant health service providers to co-operate with local authorities. Medical confidentiality would preclude the sharing of this information without consent.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000355"></a>Amendment No. 106 would require any person who has responsibility for issuing a warning notice to have an understanding of disabilities or health conditions. It does not make clear how an anti-social behaviour co-ordinator would be able to demonstrate an understanding of disabilities or health conditions, and it is also not clear about the level of knowledge and experience that would be deemed necessary to meet the test. I do not doubt the importance of having medical input in the decision, but a wide range of issues need to be considered alongside health issues to best assess an appropriate course of action. Anti-social behaviour co-ordinators have a wealth of knowledge and experience in dealing with all the issues that can contribute to anti-social behaviour.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000356"></a>Amendments Nos. 104B and 104D seek to reduce the severity of the sanction. The intention is that the sanction should act as an incentive for households to take up support, and, to be effective, the sanction must carry weight. We want to send a strong message that the right to housing benefit comes with a responsibility to be a decent neighbour. The graduated increase in the sanction from 10 per cent for four weeks to 20 per cent for four weeks and then to 100 per cent gives an increasing incentive. If hardship were to be limited to a 10 per cent reduction, this graduated approach would be lost. We believe that the level of the sanction should be set in regulations. The regulations will be affirmative and therefore subject to approval by both Houses if they are changed. This is the way that sanction levels are set in other benefit regimes and it gives the necessary flexibility should changes to the rates of reduction be required.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000357"></a>Amendment No. 104C would remove Section 130B(4)(b), which provides safeguards for vulnerable groups by making housing benefit payable in certain circumstances even when all the conditions for the sanction are met. It allows the local authority not to sanction at all if it considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the particular household. Removing this subsection would undermine the safeguards built into the measures.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000358"></a>Amendment No. 104E would reduce the maximum possible length of a sanction from five years to12 months. The starting point of the possible five-year period is the date on which the relevant order for possession is made. In practical terms, there may be a significant delay between the start of the five-year period and a sanction actually starting. For example, the order might be suspended and breached at a later date, leading to eviction; or, after being evicted, the household might live with family or friends for a period and would not therefore be in receipt of housing benefit. The intended outcome of the proposal is that problem households stop causing trouble within their  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC289"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>communities. That will not happen overnight. Intensive support is often required. It is important that households are encouraged to undertake a full process of rehabilitation, and that can often take longer than12 months. Having a sanction period of 12 months would reduce the effectiveness of the sanction and could in some cases render it unusable.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000359"></a>Amendments Nos. 104F and 106A are both concerned with ensuring that support offered to the household is appropriate. It is in no one&#146;s interest for local authorities or rehabilitation service providers to provide support that is unsuitable. And it is not the intention that households should be sanctioned for not accepting support that is not appropriate to them. Households that have already been evicted for anti-social behaviour may have many and complex needs. The support they require must be carefully considered. Our intention is that rehabilitation service providers will work closely with the household when considering the needs of that household. The development of a support package would involve discussions with the household to arrive at a support package that was appropriate to them. As a further assurance, during the development of the pilots, officials will be working closely with support providers and other relevant stakeholders in producing guidance for developing support packages.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000360"></a>Amendment No. 104F would omit the words &#147;or may provide&#148;. The practical effect of the amendment would be that an authority would not be able to use a sanction unless it could provide rehabilitation services. I can confirm that the sanction will be available only where support services are available and where they have been offered and refused. That is explicit within the legislation and so this rewording is not necessary. Local authorities will need regularly to review all the circumstances of a case in considering whether to end the sanction. This will include a regular review of the appropriateness of actions being taken to address the problem behaviour. We will set out in guidance that regular reviews of cases must be undertaken. This isa sensible approach, which we will test throughpiloting.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000361"></a>Amendment No. 106A would allow an independent review to be requested at any time&#151;perhaps many times in relation to one warning notice. It would not, however, prevent a sanction being imposed or continuing if a review were requested or was underway. Nor does it consider who might carry out such a review. Under these circumstances, the amendment would not be a helpful addition to the Bill.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000362"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 107. The amendment seeks to ensure that pilots regarding the sanctioning of housing benefit end in January 2012. It also seeks to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of any decision to roll out this scheme nationally by requiring that primary legislation is revised and new regulations made before a national rollout. As has been identified, a similar amendment was discussed and voted on in another place. We intend to commence the pilots for this proposal as soon as practicable. This will be in late 2007 or early 2008. I assure noble Lords that these pilots will last for two years, and for two years only.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000363"></a>I can also give an assurance about the level of parliamentary scrutiny that would be necessary before this proposal could be introduced nationally. Before national rollout, we are committed to producing a full regulatory impact assessment for the proposal. New regulations, both affirmative and negative, would also need to be made. This will provide sufficient scope for parliamentary scrutiny of the proposal prior to any national rollout.</p>
<h5><a name="07030169000626"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000364"></a>There are relevant sections in both the affirmative and negative regulations for this proposal that will limit the length of the piloting powers. At the point when the regulations are being made, we will havea much more precise idea of when the pilotswill commence and therefore end. We will make a decision on national rollout at the end of the pilots based on a full evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000365"></a>There is strong evidence that intensive support can help to tackle the root causes of anti-social behaviour. It is right that we do all that we can to encourage households to take up such support when it is offered and necessary. It is not our intention to sanction widely. Local authorities will have discretion when considering whether a sanction is an appropriate course of action, which it certainly will not be in every case. The authority will also have discretion to end the sanction at any time. There will be an appeals regime and hardship rights. Households can choose to end the sanction. Benefit can and will be reinstated if those being sanctioned take up the rehabilitation being offered to them.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000366"></a>I shall address some of the additional specific questions that were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked what would happen if there were a severe shortage of available rehabilitation. That is a reasonable question. The Government are investing heavily in rehabilitation. The Respect action plan announced our commitment to set up a national network of family intervention projects. The Respect task force has worked with around 50 areas to establish a national network of family intervention projects, for which funding will be provided in 2006-07 and 2007-08. The Department for Education and Skills has also made an additional&#163;6 million available for 2007-08 to enable the new Respect areas announced on 22 January to invest in extra parenting provision to tackle and prevent anti-social behaviour. The sanction is intended as a tool to get those who are evicted for anti-social behaviour to take up the support offered to them. Where appropriate support is not available, the local authority will not be able to use the sanction&#151;I stress that point.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000367"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked whether we are targeting people on housing benefit and in the rented sector. No one is suggesting that anti-social behaviour is confined to those who are in rented accommodation or those who claim state benefits. We do not see this measure as the primary tool for tackling anti-social behaviour but, rather, as one tool in a range of measures that we are developing as part of the Respect agenda. As noble Lords will be aware, there are already other ways to tackle anti-social

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000368"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, made much of the huge impact of the sanction on families and children, yet the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, predicted that it would not be used at all. In reality, we expect it to be used in very few cases because it is meant to encourage people to participate in the support that is available to them, and we must make sure that that is accomplished.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000369"></a>I was going to raise a number of points to take noble Lords through the process and to reassure them about the steps that will be involved, but, given the business still before us, I will not extend this debate unless anyone presses me to do so. In the light of the assurances that I have already given, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000370"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07030169000725"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I thank the Minister for that response. I was particularly keen on the emphasis that he laid on rehabilitation, because that must be the whole purpose of the exercise. We are aware of the difficult situations that can arise when households and families are involved and of the whole question of ASBOs, as well as of the evictions which might well follow from them.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000371"></a>These families need support. It appears that, despite the advice of local government agencies and others that sanctions would not necessarily be conducive to solving these problems, the Government have gone out on a limb, not in a small way but with a big stick in the form of these sanctions. Only in January 2004, the department said that in the light of concerns, particularly from local authorities which play a key part in preventing and dealing with antisocial behaviour and private and registered social landlords, it decided not to proceed with a housing benefit sanction at the time. Yet the situation appears to have changed in Government thinking. I welcome the fact that Parliament will have the opportunity to review these proposals because I regard them as extremely draconian measures. A10 per cent reduction in housing benefit is a significant sanction on families that are highly dependent on public support. It is large reduction in their resources and is certainly an incentive for them to seek rehabilitation. The deepest concern on these Benches is that we cannot be absolutely certain that the Government have the resources in place for rehabilitation,which I accept is the most important element of the programme.</p>

I question the whole structure of co-ordinators, evictors and respect areas we are now hearing about. What on earth is a respect area? Are we not meant to have respect in other areas? This is all about something dreamt up by the Government spin merchants and then trying to fit everything into that category. It will not have the effect of helping the people who need it.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000375"></a>On the specific point of Amendment No. 105, I was pleased to hear the Minister say that we would need to limit the coverage to specific areas of the health service. As he read out the list of the various members of the health service who would be affected as the amendment is drafted at the moment, it sounded like the definition of a healthcare professional we discussed yesterday. However, I fully accept it and I am delighted at the Minister&#146;s offer of help. We would be more than happy to withdraw our amendment if he would like to bring forward a government amendment incorporating those changes.</p>

However, I am afraid I did not hear him deal with what we consider to be a genuine attempt to bridge the gap with a compromise that would allow the pilot to go ahead but with the control still firmly held here, which we do not believe would be the case with the statutory provisions in regulations as he proposes. I did not hear him address those suggestions. I am bound to say that while I will withdraw the amendment now, I look forward to introducing something very similar on Report.</p>

I asked him what had changed since then. I accept that he has talked of the increasing availability of rehabilitation services and such like, but I am far from certain that that is enough to withdraw all our objections to the clause.</p>

The development of support services has clearly moved on, however, in communities up and down the country. Picking up on a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, rehabilitation support services are not only meant to kick in when people get evicted and are about to be sanctioned, but before that. We hope that that is the overwhelming result. Nobody wants to have to apply these sanctions; they will be a success if they are never used. We must all hope for that outcome.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000386"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to this amendment&#151;in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Best, as well as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale and me&#151;I shall raise some points arising from the reform of the local housing allowance. In general, we support the reforms. The new system, basing an entitlement to housing benefit solely on the area people are living in and the size of the household, is considerably simpler than the old one. Pilots havealso suggested a significant drop in shortfalls between benefit received and actual rent, both in the number of people suffering a shortfall and in the average amount of a shortfall, both of which are good news.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000387"></a>However, the new system has raised some concerns which I shall probe today. There have been many comments on the size of the broad market rent areas, which often, and most likely will, encompass more than one local authority. The inclusion of areas of housing of very different prices in one rent area has resulted in some areas within a rent area being completely unaffordable to any recipients of housing benefit. That would seem contrary to the Government&#146;s stated aim of ensuring mixed and sustainable communities.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000388"></a>The problem is particularly acute where both a town and the surrounding countryside are included in one broad market rent area. In this case, the rural accommodation available to those collecting housing benefit, already often difficult to rent due to lack of availability, is likely to become completely unaffordable. The rent areas are, of course, decided by the rent officer, who is hired by the department in England, or the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly in those areas. He is not hired by the local authorities who have to live with the consequences of his decision.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000389"></a>Our amendment therefore seeks to make his role and decisions more transparent, allowing discrepancies and over-zealousness in excluding unusually high rents to be identified and moderated, to ensure that a fair housing allowance is reached. He would also have to consult the local authorities to ensure that he is aware of any local concerns they might have about the inclusion or exclusion of certain areas.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000390"></a>The Government have already indicated to some organisations that such liaison should take place. It would be helpful to hear that the Government are taking steps to ensure that it happens in future. This liaison should include not just the housing benefit officers, who I understand are generally consulted anyway, but other officers with housing responsibilities. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says on the reforms and the measures that the Government are taking to address my concerns. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000391"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07030169000733"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> We support the amendment. It seems to be a no-brainer. Why on earth would rent officers not want to be transparent and clear in their work? That is essential, given the interesting examples cited by the CAB and Shelter, covering places such as Barnet, South Dorset, Leeds and Conwy, which showed wide evidence of problems of affordability of housing and finding housing at the rents that rent officers are sanctioning. This seems to be a straightforward measure and I cannot see what rent officers have to hide. It would help people who are disadvantaged by the system to discuss it, look at it and understand what is happening. I would have thought that it was very much in the interests of rent officers around the country, so I cannot see why it would not be acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000392"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07030169000734"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I think that the Minister has the <I>Benefits and Contributions Information Guide 2006</I> in front of her. Not quite, apparently, but I have. We all know that at the moment, if a housing benefit claimant is a council tenant, the amount of rent due is reduced correspondingly. If the claimant rents from a housing association or has a private landlord, housing benefit is paid directly to the person entitled. New claims from private tenants, including changes of address, are paid in arrears. If the rent is eight weeks or more in arrears, housing benefit is automatically paid directly to the landlord unless the local authority has reason to believe that the landlord is not a fit and proper person to receive those payments. Lastly, direct payments to the landlord may also be made if the claimant requests or agrees to such payments or if  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC295"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the local authority thinks that they are in the claimant&#146;s interests. New claims from private tenants, including changes of address, where payment is made directly to the landlord are paid four weeks in arrears. </p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000393"></a>Much of that will be changed by the Bill. It would be of use to the Committee to know exactly how much is staying and how much is going, not least to tie this amendment into the ESA, which we spent two and a half days discussing. Is the &#163;20 earnings disregard to continue for housing benefit if the claimant is entitled to disability premiums, severe disability premiums and carer premium? I appreciate that I may not be speaking to the right amendment, but it would be extremely useful to have the answers before the next one.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000394"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07030169000735"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank the noble Lord for bringing about this debate. I am trying to think of something amusing to say about standing here wearing my daffodil. I took it off momentarily to give it a drink, because it was starting to get a bit tired, so when the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was congratulated on his, I had to pull mine up from under the table immediately.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000395"></a>On an amusing note, I have just been handed the most wonderful piece of paper that I have had so far in this Committee. It just says, &#147;Yes&#148;. We will come on to that.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000396"></a>The aim of the amendment is to clarify the role that rent officers will play under the local housing allowance. I welcome many of the aims of the amendment and understand the sentiments behind it, but I take this opportunity to assure noble Lords that it is unnecessary. Rent officers will have a pivotal role to play in the local housing allowance. They will be responsible, as has already been described, for setting the local housing allowance rates and the broad rental market areas in which those rates will apply. As we have already heard, that will be key.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000397"></a>Collaborative working between rent officers and local authority staff has resulted in an excellent partnership, ensuring effective administration of housing benefit. However, I appreciate that some of our stakeholders have found it difficult to understand the methodology employed by rent officers and exactly how they have fitted into a complex housing benefit system. We have an opportunity to make the role of rent officers, and the decisions they make, more transparent and open. I am grateful for all the work that organisations such as the Catholic Housing Aid Society in Kirklees have done to help identify some of the difficulties and propose practical solutions.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000398"></a>We accept that the rollout of the local housing allowance presents an opportunity to put in place the processes demonstrating that rent officers make the right decisions. However, the best and most flexible way to do this is through guidance rather than legislation. We must also ensure that, in improving transparency, we do not undermine rent officers&#146; ability to collect accurate information and evidence.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000399"></a>To calculate local reference rents and local housing allowances, rent officers currently use a wide range of evidence from the relevant rental market. To collect  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the evidence needed, rent officers use a variety of research methods and professional contacts, including individual landlords and lettings agents. Much of the information they gather is commercially sensitive and given in confidence. Requesting that rent officers publish this information would have two serious consequences, which I do not think that the amendments are intended to achieve. First, it would undermine the rent officer&#146;s relationships with letting agents, and could lead to these agents withholding information that they do not wish to be made public. That would undermine the reliability of housing benefit rates. Secondly, it could result in stakeholders attempting to influence the rent officers&#146; decisions by providing additional but inaccurate market evidence.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000400"></a>With the national introduction of the local housing allowance, the rates and the broad rental market areas relating to a local authority will be published&#151;and this is key&#151;to allow customers to see in advance what the maximum level of housing benefit, for a certain size of accommodation, will be. This transparencyis one of the key advantages of the local housing allowance.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000401"></a>As the Minister for Disabled People stated in the other place, we also want to take this opportunity to ensure that the way these rates and areas are set is as clear as possible. I give a firm commitment that rent officers will consult with local authorities, both the housing benefit departments which noble Lords asked about and the wider housing strategy departments, when they are setting broad rental market areas to ensure that the areas accurately reflect the local housing markets and communities. The Rent Service in England will also put this into guidance for rent officers that will be published on the internet. We will work with rent officers to ensure that their role is aligned with wider government aims of encouraging mixed and sustainable communities, and that they deliver a consistent approach for all local communities. The planned two-year review of the local housing allowance will provide us with the opportunity to check that these processes are working effectively.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000402"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether the &#163;20 earnings disregard would remain following the introduction of local housing allowance. As I have said, the answer is &#147;yes&#148;.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000403"></a>I hope that I have picked up on the important concerns that were expressed about the need for transparency, the need for rent officers to work closely with local authorities, and the need for fairness and openness. I hope that noble Lords will therefore feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000404"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07030169000736"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I am happy to withdraw my amendment, because I was much reassured by the noble Baroness&#146;s comments about the transparency of the process, which the amendment was seeking to establish. When the two-year review takes place, we should have the opportunity to see the demographic influence that the process may have had. Perhaps the biggest danger in setting this rent level is the possibility of our upsetting the mixed demographics of substantial communities. I hope that that will be part and parcel of the review. It should not look just at the efficacy of the system in providing rental cover.</p>

At the moment, they do not have to worry about the temptations of money going through their hands or through bank accounts. Many of them will not have bank accounts, or will have terminated them. These people will be at risk of severely mismanaging funds. It is well established that not only lack of money but also handling money incorrectly leads to a great deal of poverty. In this case&#151;and we are talking about somebody losing his home and all the consequences that flow from that&#151;I ask the Minister whether the Government can find some way to accept this amendment or something very like it. If it is to become the norm for people falling into these groups&#151;for example, someone with a drugs, alcohol or gambling addiction, or who is just out of prison&#151;to have access to the money, why do we not simply straightaway hand the money to the suppliers? It is literally that simple. My noble friend used the term &#147;no-brainer&#148;. I do not know if that is parliamentary language, but this is roughly getting towards it. I beg to move.</p>

I have added my name to it. On these Benches, we have serious concerns over the Government&#146;s intention to encourage customer claimants to handle their housing benefit rather than opting to have it paid directly to their landlord. Although we understand their aim of encouraging financial responsibility and are pleased that they are attempting to give recipients more freedom to manage their income as they see fit, we think that doing these things by this method is dangerous and is likely to lead to more harm than good. As a result, want to have a stand part debate for the whole clause.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000417"></a>Currently, only 40 per cent of private housing tenants receiving housing benefits handle the money. Under the Pathfinders, we understand that the number has doubled to 80 per cent. Will the Minister reassure me that these figures are not being achieved by setting targets for local authorities, but really are a reflection of the conditions on the ground?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000418"></a>As the amendment suggests, we are very concerned by the expectation that people unable to handle their own money must draw their vulnerability or unsuitability to the attention of the housing authority. It is unlikely

Waiting until the problem is so far advanced before taking action will do nothing to improve the claimant&#146;s personal responsibility and could cause significant hardship and distress.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000419"></a>We understand from Citizens Advice that the Government have removed the specific lack of an obligation to be proactive from the guidance. Is that the case? Will the Government therefore actively encourage housing officials to identify vulnerable claimants?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000420"></a>These measures are also likely to have knock-on effects on the housing market. The secure knowledge that their rent will arrive on time, and in full, is an important reason private landlords rent to benefit recipients. I am aware that recipients do not need to declare that they are receiving housing benefit to their landlord, but it is not in anyone&#146;s interest to see the supply of private housing shrink to those who do. With greater uncertainty over the security of their rents, it is likely that private housing will become more expensive, more limited or both.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000421"></a>Finally, I would like to revisit a point made at Second Reading by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. If the Government are so sure that these steps will be beneficial for housing benefit recipients, why are they not extending the option to tenants of social sector housing?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000422"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07030169000744"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I shall try to respond quickly to these points. One of the central objectives of housing benefit reform is to match rights with responsibilities. Clause 36 provides for powers prescribing the manner in which housing benefit is to be paid to all types of tenant. While I recognise the positive intention of Amendment No. 108 that seeks to protect the interests of customers who may have a higher level of need, I can assure noble Lords that this amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000423"></a>Under current legislation and regulations, housing benefit customers can be paid by way of rebate of their rent account, by payment to the customer&#151;including someone on their behalf&#151;or by a combination of both. Where the authority is not the landlord&#151;that is, where the customer is in the private rented or housing association sector&#151;it cannot rebate the customer and therefore has to pay the customer or someone on their behalf such as a landlord, or a third party.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000424"></a>In the local housing allowance pathfinders, the proportion of payments made to tenants has increased from 50 per cent to 84 per cent after two years. The Pathfinder evaluation found customers to be, on the whole, good money managers who actively budget to ensure their finances are stable and take paying their rent very seriously. The minority who were initially daunted by the prospect of paying their own rent tended to be young people inexperienced in managing their finances or people who had pre-existing financial difficulties. With help and advice, many of these individuals developed the skills not only to manage their rent payments but also to improve their wider financial capability&#151;an important step on the road to employment.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000425"></a>We therefore believe that excluding individuals from the responsibility of managing their housing benefit payments on the basis that they meet a pre-determined set of criteria would not be the right way to proceed. This approach would constrain the flexibility of local authorities to act in the best interests of the customer and could deny many capable customers the benefits of managing their own housing benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000426"></a>However, we will not force this responsibility on to those who are genuinely unable to exercise it and will provide support to those who need it. Funding to support financial advice services has been set aside for the national rollout of local housing allowance. This is further supplemented by cross-government activity to increase financial inclusion, in particular to help individuals access appropriate banking services.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000427"></a>To protect vulnerable customers, safeguards are in place for the national rollout of local housing allowance. Regulations will ensure that payments can be made to the landlord where the customer is likely to have difficulty managing their financial affairs, where it is improbable that they will pay their rent or where payment has been made to the landlord previously during the award due to arrears of eight weeks or more. Payment will always be made directly to the landlord, subject to limited exceptions, where there are eight weeks or more rent arrears. Customers can also elect to have their benefit paid to a third party other than their landlord. Guidance will be available to help local authorities apply these safeguards. It will be informed by lessons learned from the pathfinders and comments from the welfare organisations working with us.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000428"></a>With regard to the social rented sector, which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, highlighted, I feel very strongly that tenants of local authorities and housing associations should reap the benefits gained by private tenants in the pathfinders from managing their rent. Currently where the authority is the landlord, it effectively has a choice as to the manner of payment. Invariably tenants in these cases, that is council tenants, end up having their rent rebated. In addition, less than one in10 housing association tenants nationally are responsible for managing their housing benefit. In response to the welfare reform Green Paper consultation we decided not to introduce the local housing allowance to the social sector at this time; however, this clause supports the extension of payment of housing benefit to tenants and, therefore, the principle of tenants&#146; responsibility to all housing benefit customers.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000429"></a>It is wrong to assume that social tenants are any less able to manage their housing benefit payments than their peers in the private sector. In fact, independent research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggests that social tenants are just as likely to have the financial capability and the willingness to manage their housing benefit payments. At present, the rate of worklessness among social tenants is twice the national average. Encouraging more tenants to handle their own housing benefit payments is a step towards financial inclusion and greater readiness for employment. Not taking this responsibility risks undermining their self-reliance and could contribute to benefit dependency. Clause 36 provides for powers prescribing the manner in which

This clause will enable us to require local authorities to make payments of housing benefit to their tenants so that the principle of tenant responsibility can be extended to all types of tenants.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000430"></a>Of course, any change to the rules affecting social tenants would, as in the private rented sector, include safeguards to protect those who are unable to manage their own affairs, as has been described so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Support for those who are less experienced in managing their rent should be available. We will proceed cautiously in the social sector. We do not intend to make regulations under this power or under our existing powers that will affect social tenants until we are confident that we have the right approach and the right support mechanisms in place.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000431"></a>I want to respond to a couple of points made during our discussion. I was asked how proactive local authorities will be in assessing a customer&#146;s vulnerability when setting housing benefit. If a local authority receives notice that a claimant might be vulnerable, it must investigate whether that is the case. That notice could include, as has been suggested, the customer&#146;s own representations. Further, the landlord will have the opportunity to be proactive and his representations would be accepted, as would representations from advocacy services such as a citizens advice bureaux, social services, the GP and other healthcare professionals, along with organisations that act as representatives on behalf of claimants. If agreed, the amendment would place a requirement on local authorities to assess every single claimant and potential claimant for vulnerability. Our approach allows for customers who have the potential to fall into arrears and who may be vulnerable to be picked up proactively through other means.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000432"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment and that I have not rushed too quickly through this slightly more complicated issue.</p>

She spoke of an eight-week period. However, my assessment is that many people would be out of their home within that time if they fell into arrears. Have I heard her correctly?

<p><a name="07030169000445"></a>The noble Baroness said: Government Amendments Nos. 108A and 108B address concerns raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights on one aspect of Clause 40, which deals with the use of social security information.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000446"></a>One area where the Government are keen to make further progress is encouraging more people to claim the social security benefits to which they may be entitled. In doing so, we want to make the most of the social security information that local and national government agencies collect and hold. Currently, DWP can use any social security information it holds to promote the take-up of any benefit, but local authorities administering housing benefit and council tax benefit can use information only to promote the take-up of those two benefits.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC303"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000447"></a>Among other things, Clause 40 aims to enable local authorities, which through this clause now includes English county councils, to use the social security information that they hold to promote the take-up of a range of benefits, including those administered by DWP and which are to be specified in regulations, the draft of which will be available to the House.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000448"></a>This would be achieved by the insertion of a new Section 7B into the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which was originally worded to enable the prescription of benefit take-up activity through regulations. The Joint Committee on Human Rights felt that the original wording was too wide and would enable other unspecified purposes to be prescribed. The Delegated Powers Committee considered that if the clause were not amended then regulations made under it should be subject to the Affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000449"></a>The Government are happy to accept that changes should be made and to make it explicit that the powers in subsections (1) and (3) of new Section 7B are to be used solely to encourage people to claim the benefits to which they may be entitled. We touched on the importance of that earlier.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000450"></a>The clause is an integral part of the Government's plans to secure improvements in the service that public authorities can offer their customers, a greater take-up of benefits and a more streamlined administration. In the light of the above, I move the amendment, and commend Clause 40.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000451"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07030169000752"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for introducing the amendments, which take account of part of what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee had to say on the matter. One thing not available to us in what I earlier called the little red book, but let us call it the large red book, was the draft regulation under Clause 40. I was interested to hear the noble Baroness say that the draft regulations will be available. The question, therefore, is: when?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000452"></a>On clause stand part, I was going to probe current practice of sharing information, to which the clause refers, and to explore exactly what the Government intend to change. I am curious that there appears to be no provision for the sharing of information for the purposes of preventing fraud in current legislation. If a claimant is defrauding one part of the benefit system, it is extremely likely that he or she will be defrauding another. It seems a basic precaution to alert the relevant people just in case that is happening. Can the noble Baroness explain why it has not until now been considered necessary to do that?</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000453"></a>However, there is a limit to the sort of information that should be shared&#151;a subject to which I referred on Second Reading. Information on fraud should certainly be shared, but much information that those who decide on disability benefits will hold on a claimant is confidential and should certainly not be shared lightly, nor without express permission of the person whom it concerns.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000454"></a>One must look at other happenings in the House. I do not know if the noble Baroness has been listening to any of the debate on the Serious Crime Bill but in that, the confidential nature of health information is  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appreciated, with patient data being disclosed only voluntarily. That should be true here. I am not sure that I heard the noble Baroness being as definitive on that point as she sometimes is on others. There is no need to share health data without the claimant's permission. To do so would be unacceptable. I am sure that she will tell me now that the Government have no intention of sharing such information. Should there then not be a safeguard in the Bill to prevent any future move away from that line?</p>

<p><a name="07030169000457"></a>On the point made about information-sharing about fraud, I am informed that there is already a legislative gateway to share information to tackle fraud which has been in place for years, so there is no requirement for another gateway in the Bill.

The clause, and regulations to be made under it, will replace the current legislation governing the circumstances in which payment of attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance is withdrawn from care home residents.

Accordingly, to prevent the duplication of provision from public funds, payments of attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance are withdrawn after 28 days where the care home accommodation is either provided by a local authority, or the costs of the accommodation are met in full or in part out of public or local funds, under specified legislation.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000478"></a>However, the current legislation in this area is confusing both to customers and their advisers for two reasons. First, it does not define what is meant by the &#147;costs of accommodation&#148;. It is generally accepted that, under the current legislation, the &#147;costs of accommodation&#148; include not only the cost of the accommodation and board received in a care home but also the costs ofany personalised care received. The Social Security Commissioners have supported this interpretation whenever it has been challenged. But the fact that this interpretation has been challenged proves that the current legislation is far from transparent to our customers.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000479"></a>The second reason for this clause is to provide a more effective and efficient method for updating the references to the &#147;specified legislation&#148; under which we define what services are borne out of public or local funds, because references to the legislation are themselves currently in primary legislation. This clause remedies those difficulties in two ways. First, it removes the ambiguity in the meaning of the &#147;costs of the accommodation&#148; to make it clear that attendance allowance and the care component of disability living allowance will be withdrawn only where the costs of any &#147;qualifying services&#148;, as defined, are met from public or local funds. Secondly, it provides regulation-making powers to list the specified legislation in regulations instead of the primary legislation. This will make it easier and quicker to update the statutory references from time to time as required.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000480"></a>The noble Lord has rightly raised concerns as to why we have not tied our definition of a care home to either an existing definition, such as that provided in the Care Standards Act 2000, or by reference to an establishment being registered. On the back of this there may be a concern that the changes to the legislation effected by Clause 59 will bring into scope people who are living in non-residential care settings where high levels of care and support are provided for by a local authority&#151;for instance, extra care housing, sheltered accommodation, adult placements and the like. Let me deal with this latter point first as I would like to make it absolutely clear to noble Lords that we have no intention whatever of broadening the scope for removing benefits. I appreciate that concerns may remain, particularly because we intend to provide our definition of &#147;specified enactments&#148; in regulations rather than in the Bill. However, I can assure noble Lords that the definitions will clarify but not alter who will and who will have not have payment of their attendance allowance or care component of disability living allowance withdrawn. Those who do not currently have their benefit withdrawn under the existing legislation will not have it withdrawn as a result of this clause and the regulations.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000481"></a>Under Clause 59, regulations may provide that attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance may be withdrawn if any of the costs of qualifying services are borne out of public or local funds under a specified enactment. Qualifying services include accommodation&#151;the bricks and mortar&#151;board and personal care. The enactment under which housing benefit is payable will not be specified in the regulations and therefore a person will not have the benefit withdrawn by virtue of their using housing benefit to pay for the bricks and mortar of their accommodation.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000482"></a>Regulations currently specifically exclude from the costs of accommodation domiciliary services provided in respect of a person in a private dwelling. This enables those in, for example, sheltered accommodation or adult placements whose bricks and mortar accommodation costs are met by housing benefit, as is usually the case, to retain their attendance allowance and the care component of disability living allowance. The regulations under Clause 59 will also ensure that people in such types of accommodation will not have their benefits withdrawn.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000483"></a>We intend to include in the new regulations the same exclusion for domiciliary services provided in a private dwelling. This will mean that a person will not have their benefit withdrawn by virtue of receiving board and/or personal care paid for out of public funds under a specified enactment such as the National Assistance Act where such services are domiciliary services provided in their own home, such as they would be in a sheltered accommodation or adult placement environment. To ensure that we get these regulations right, we will be consulting withkey stakeholders such as the Local Government Association, the Department of Health and the devolved administrations on the wording of those regulations to ensure that they properly reflect our intentions and do not unintentionally introduce any anomalies.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000484"></a>I turn now to why we choose to tie our definition of a care home either to an existing definition or one based on whether an accommodation is registered. I agree that at first glance, using such a definition seems a sensible idea and indeed we closely examined the merits of defining a care home in the same way as the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 when drafting Clause 59. However, we decided not to base the definition in this way because the definitions provided by those pieces of legislation do not encapsulate all the institutions which are currently covered, such as children&#146;shomes, adult training centres and accommodation specifically for disabled students. These institutions need to be covered so that attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance is properly withdrawn to prevent duplication of funding. Defining a care home in the way we have also allows us to break any link to primary legislation into current definitions which may change in future. I hope that I have covered, perhaps extensively, all the points the noble Lord has raised or might have had an interest in and provided the reassurance he seeks. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07030169000485"></a><b><a name="70301-gc0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07030169000759"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> It really is extremely annoying that for the last few amendments of the Bill we are under such pressure of time. Had we not been I would have stopped the Minister very early on and given him the same advice that I gave to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, on her first amendment&#151;for goodness sake to slow down so that what he says is comprehensible. I found that pretty incomprehensible and I shall have to read what he said in <I>Hansard</I>. On the whole I am prepared to accept that this clause is purely technical.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000486"></a>However, I will have to look more carefully at whether a supported living service that might not currently be considered to be a care home could conceivably be covered by the regulations broughtin under this broader definition. I think theMinister referred to that in his rapid mode of delivery. Therefore, I will only press him&#151;perhaps privately&#151;later should I need to, having read what he said in <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000492"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving AmendmentNo. 111 I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 112, 114 and 115. These amendments relate to the use of healthcare professionals in medical examinations necessary for a decision on entitlement to benefit. What we mean by healthcare professional is defined in the Bill as a member of a profession which is concerned wholly or partly with the physical or mental health of individuals. That will include, for example, doctors, nurses and community psychiatric nurses.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000493"></a>Section 19 of the Social Security Act 1998 currently allows a person to be referred for a medical examination and report to a medical practitioner where that is considered necessary for the purpose of providing information for use in making a decision on entitlement to benefit.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000494"></a>Section 20 of the 1998 Act allows the &#147;eligible member&#148;, that is the legally qualified member of an appeal tribunal, to ask for a medical examination and report by a medical practitioner to aid their determination of an appeal before the appeal tribunal.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000495"></a>The Government are keen, however, to develop a much wider use of healthcare professionals in the delivery of medical services and in particular undertaking medical examinations. Healthcare professionals are now playing a wider role and are taking on clinical roles previously reserved for doctors. The White Paper <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I> outlined the strategy for expanding the role of practice nurses and other healthcare professionals, and we want to reflect these intentions in the social security system.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000496"></a>It has recently become clear, however, that contrary to what we previously thought, the current legislation does not include a power to make full use ofthe potential of healthcare professionals in theprovision of medical services for social security benefit claimants.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000497"></a>Without this amendment the department would be unable to take full advantage of the skills that healthcare professionals offer, particularly in the delivery of disability benefits such as DLA and AA. Amending Section 20 of the 1998 Act provides that the legally qualified tribunal member may refer an appellant to a particular type of healthcare professional, including the power to refer a person to a medical practitioner. It is important that the legally qualified member of a tribunal can decide what type of healthcare professional an appellant should be referred to for an examination.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000498"></a>Amendment No. 112 amends Section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, to ensure that the provisions that currently make it an offence for a medical practitioner to disclose information about a person without lawful authority are extended to include healthcare professionals. We wish to amend the legislation governing these matters as quickly as possible, to avoid any doubts about our commitment to better, more efficient delivery in existing benefits. The amendments will also ensure that the department&#146;s medical service provider is able to provide the level of medical support required across the department. I beg to move.</p>

We were told that &#147;healthcare professionals&#148; were to be employed Atos Origin, but they will not necessarily be GPs, nurses, physiotherapists and so on. I am not entirely sure that these amendments cover that point. I shall have to study carefully what the Minister had said.</p>

<a name="70301-gc0010.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07030169000501"></a>Since this is the last amendment, I thank the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, for being so tolerant with me and my noble friend, and our sometimes rather unusual way of discovering the Government&#146;s intentions. I am extremely grateful.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07030135000027"></a>In the defence industrial strategy (DIS) fixed-wing sector, the Ministry of Defence committed to negotiating with BAE Systems the terms of a long-term partnering agreement (LTPA) to help to sustain the key industrial skills and capabilities needed to support and upgrade the current and future aircraft fleet. The Ministry of Defence has today signed a foundation contract with BAE Systems as the first step towards delivering a full and legally binding LTPA by the end of 2007, subject to negotiations.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07030135000028"></a>The foundation contract is intended to help to establish the key elements of the LTPA and inform the detailed negotiations ahead. It also incentivises BAE Systems to further transform its air sector business to ensure the efficient delivery of the key through-life defence industrial capabilities that the Armed Forces require.</p>

<a name="07030135000029"></a><b><a name="70301-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07030135000097"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS135"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column WS135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07030135000030"></a>Last July, the Home Secretary announced the biggest shake-up of the immigration system in its history. To drive through this programme of reform, the Home Secretary made it clear that the IND, which will become the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) on 1 April, required more transparency and stronger oversight and accountability arrangements.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07030135000031"></a>Today there are a number of bodies that monitor, inspect or advise on specific parts of the immigration system. What is lacking is a clear and consistent overall view. There is also no external oversight of key areas such as enforcement.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07030135000032"></a>In December 2006, we carried out a public consultation on proposals for an independent inspectorate that would deliver an effective inspection of IND. We are extremely grateful to everyone who contributed. The responses received revealed very wide support for the idea of an independent inspectorate and how it should be taken forward. This paper sets out the Government&#146;s formal response to the consultation exercise.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07030135000033"></a>We propose to create a single inspectorate that will focus on overall efficiency and effectiveness across IND&#146;s and its partners&#146; operations, quality of decision-making, enforcement powers, access to information and treatment of individuals, including a sense of comparative performance in different regions of the country.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07030135000034"></a>Effective assessment of these key themes will provide confidence to Parliament and the public and to those who use and receive services from IND. I very much hope that everyone who is concerned with the immigration and nationality system will continue to work with us as we seek to develop the improvements and assurance that this new, stronger and more effective inspection will bring.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="07030135000035"></a><b><a name="70301-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="07030135000098"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following statement.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07030135000036"></a>Four years after the invasion, progress on reconstruction and development in Iraq remains mixed. Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s Government, less than a year old, face immense security, political and economic challenges. The escalating sectarian violence, which is for many Iraqis a daily reality, has displaced large numbers of people both within Iraq and the wider region. We are therefore responding to help to meet urgent humanitarian needs across the country. But the critical priority now is for the Iraqi Government to end the violence, so that Iraq&#146;s rich resources can be invested in creating better services and opportunities for all Iraqi people. Only a political solution will break the destructive cycle of violence, and Prime Minister Maliki has made tackling the violence his highest priority. It is therefore vital that we give this new and democratically elected Government every assistance.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS136"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column WS136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07030135000037"></a>But there are gains worth noting and, more importantly, protecting. The most important achievement of recent years has been the establishment of a democratically elected Government, the first in Iraq for decades, replacing Saddam's brutal regime. Prime Minister Maliki's coalition Government were established following elections in which 76 per cent of the population voted. The constitution was agreed in a referendum and will be reviewed later this year. The Council of Representatives has agreed a budget law and will soon consider a hydrocarbons law to determine how Iraq's oil revenues will be managed. International support was crucial in helping to run and monitor the elections, as well as funding outreach programmes to encourage participation.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07030135000038"></a>Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and healthcare, Iraq had by 2003 suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic underinvestment. The 2003 conflict and the continued violence, including sabotage of key infrastructure, as well as low (but growing) levels of management capacity in Iraq's national and local government, have slowed progress. However, reconstruction has continued and much has been achieved by the Government of Iraq, with support from the UK, US and a range of other donors.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07030135000039"></a>With international community support, Iraq has made some improvements to basic services. Over 5 million children have received life-saving vaccinations and Iraq is now spending 30 times more on healthcare compared to pre-war levels. Over 5,168 schools have been rehabilitated and a further 450 are in progress. More than 100,000 primary and 40,000 secondary teachers have been trained. Unfortunately, the violence is seriously affecting Iraq's health and education systems, as talented professionals are targeted or choose to leave the country.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07030135000040"></a>There has also been progress on the economic front. The Iraqi economy rebounded quickly in 2004 and dollar income has continued to grow, almost doubling by 2006. Income growth has mainly been driven by rising oil prices, so the challenge now is to convert more of the windfall earnings from oil to productive investments in public services and infrastructure.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07030135000041"></a>The UK is one of the first major donors to Iraq to fully disburse our Madrid pledge&#151;&#163;544 million since 2003. The further pledge of &#163;100 million announced by the Chancellor is on top of this, bringing the total UK commitment to &#163;644 million. From our own resources, we have funded major electricity and water projects in southern Iraq. For example, DfID has repaired the Al Hartha power station chimney and ensured the equivalent of 24 hours electricity to 85,000 households (enough to supply a city the size of Cardiff with 24-hour power). By the time these projects are complete, we will have added or secured 470 megawatts to the national electricity grid and improved access to water for about a million people. These projects will have employed around 450 people, generated almost 100,000 work days and secured around 17,000 work days per year for operation and maintenance.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07030135000042"></a>But there is still a long way to go. The major focus of our effort now is in helping the Iraqi Government to take the lead in investing in critical services and  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS137"></a><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column WS137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>infrastructure. The Iraqi Government need to do more to provide basic services for their people and to protect those at risk. And they need to make a start on some of the economic reforms that will unlock more money to invest in better public services and infrastructure in the longer term. We and other donors are providing support to help them to do so.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07030135000043"></a>Much of the work done to get development in Iraq back on track goes unnoticed&#151;the backroom, unglamorous slog of getting the right policy advice on tough issues such as drafting and redrafting budgets, setting up systems to manage central government business and dealing with milestones such as regular IMF reviews. But it is paying off. With help from donors, including DfID, the Iraqi Government have stayed on track with its stand-by arrangement, therefore meeting the conditions of the Paris Club debt reduction deal.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07030135000044"></a>This work is hugely important because it puts Iraqis in the lead. With oil revenues of $30 billion (93 per cent of the national budget) in 2007, there is no shortage of resources in Iraq. Iraq has the resources to finance its own development. The challenge is spending it effectively. What has been lacking is the capacity of Iraqi institutions to deliver. Thanks in large part to our work in Basra and Baghdad, this is beginning to change.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07030135000045"></a>Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister recently held a meeting with the Basra governor and Provincial Council and a range of relevant national Ministers to set out Iraqi plans for the development of the province. For the first time, Basrawis heard from their own Government how much money was to be invested in their area, when and on what. This sort of transparency is vital to building a culture of trust and accountability between government and people.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07030135000046"></a>Large numbers of civil society initiatives are springing up throughout Iraq. Over 250 newspapers and magazines have been launched since the fall of the regime and there are more than 2,500 registered Iraqi NGOs, which range from groups focused on reconciliation to groups promoting women's rights and organisations trying to enhance political participation. DfID's support for Iraqi NGOs has encouraged poor and marginalised sections of Iraqi society to engage in the political process by fostering partnerships between international NGOs to provide advice and support to other Iraqi grass-roots organisations.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07030135000047"></a>While these achievements are important, and a credit to the Iraqis and their partners who work so hard in the face of enormous risks and challenges, there is much still to do. Our objective remains to develop the capacity of the democratically elected Government of Iraq and to increase their ability to provide security and basic services to the Iraqi people.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07030135000049"></a>On 1 March, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) published the following papers, which take forward the Government&#146;s legal aid reform programme set out last November in <I>Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead</I>. The papers reflect comments and concerns raised during consultation on <I>Legal Aid: A Sustainable Future</I>, published in July alongside Lord Carter&#146;s report. The papers are:</p>
the LSC&#146;s strategy for family legal aid, <I>Making Legal Rights a Reality for Children and Families</I>, which sets out the LSC&#146;s priorities for the delivery of family legal aid for the next five years;a paper re-consulting for 6 weeks until 16 April 2007 on revised fee schemes for care proceedings and family help (private), which will apply from October 2007. Changes include retention of the uplift for panel membership for exceptional cases; lowering of the threshold for exceptional cases; and increasing the graduation of the fees in private law family cases;a paper consulting for 12 weeks until 24 May 2007 on changes to the funding code in relation to public law children cases. This proposes to introduce a &#147;reasonableness&#148; test for special Children Act proceedings, and the removal of residential assessments from the scope of legal aid. As this is a new measure rather than a re-consultation, LSC is consulting for the full period;the revised immigration and asylum legal aid fee scheme, to apply from October 2007. Changes include the dropping of the proposal to introduce the early resolution payment; reduction of the exceptional case limit; and the fact that all disbursements will now be claimed separately, including interpreter fees. This is the final scheme and we are not consulting on this further; and a six-week consultation until 16 April 2007 on the category-specific sections of the unified contract, and on a separate specification for contracting for services within immigration removal centres, to come into effect with the new fee schemes in October 2007.
<a name="70301-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07030135000050"></a>The revised mental health fee scheme will be published in the next few weeks. Advocacy arrangements in family cases from April 2008 will be the subject of a separate consultation later this year. The Government value the input of practitioners and interested parties on the ongoing reform of civil and family legal aid. We encourage all those with an interest to contribute fully to the current consultations. Copies of the papers published on 1 March are available on the Legal Services Commission&#146;s website at www.legalservices.gov.uk and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="07030135000067"></a><b><a name="70301-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07030135000102"></a>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton):</b> I wish to update you on the implementation of the UK Supreme Court. As you know, on 7 September 2006 the Westminster City Council Planning and City Development Committee resolved unanimously to grant planning and listed building consent to the proposed renovation of Middlesex Guildhall in preparation for use as the UK Supreme Court. English Heritage fully supported the renovation plans.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="07030135000068"></a>Consent was granted subject to the completion of a Section 106 agreement, which was then signed by both parties on 21 November 2006. Both the planning and the listed building consents were also issued on 21 November 2006.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="07030135000069"></a>On 26 January 2007 an application was made for judicial review of the decision to grant listed building and planning consent for the renovation of Middlesex Guildhall. The application was made by SAVE Britain's Heritage against Westminster City Council.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="07030135000070"></a>The judicial review is about the way in which the issues were presented by Westminster planning officers to the committee and as a result whether there was an error in law in the way in which Westminster City Council reached its decision. It is about the process; it is not about the content of the application. I am named as an interested party in the case, and my department and I are fully supportive of Westminster City Council. Westminster City Council lodged their defence of the decision on 16 February, which we supported. The courts are now deciding whether or not there is a case to be heard.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="07030135000071"></a>In the interim, I have decided to resubmit the application for listed building and planning consent for the Middlesex Guildhall to Westminster City Council. This demonstrates our confidence in the original case and gives us a better control over timescales.</p>

<a name="70301-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="07030135000072"></a>I believe that this step is the best way to meet the needs of all parties involved and gives the best chance to deliver the Supreme Court in October 2009. Our second application will be lodged on 9 March 2007. This will be followed by the usual statutory consultation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="07030135000073"></a>The Crown Courts at Middlesex Guildhall will still close on 30 March 2007 as planned. New courtrooms are being built at Isleworth Crown Court and will be available in autumn 2008. In the mean time, transition plans are in place to maintain the number of sitting days across London Crown Courts.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="07030135000076"></a>In my Written Ministerial Statement of 10 October 2006, I undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's asset-freezing regime.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="07030135000080"></a>The Treasury has also strengthened the asset-freezing regime by agreeing, on the advice of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to use closed-source evidence in cases where there are strong operational reasons to impose a freeze but insufficient open-source evidence available.

The recent High Court judgment of 22 September 2006 in the case of M, A and MM v Her Majesty's Treasury (2006) EWCH 2328 (Admin) upheld the Treasury's actions regarding benefits payments to the households of designated individuals.

It is also a Ramsar site (wetland of international importance) and an area of special scientific interest. All suitable land and inter-tidal areas have been included within these designations, including the north shore.</p>

<a name="70301w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="07030139000025"></a>A regular programme of site monitoring assesses the effectiveness of these designations.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="07030139000033"></a>The question collects information on religious affiliation or identification, which is required by many users for monitoring equality. The question does not attempt to collect detailed information about the extent to which people practise their religion or the depth of their belief. This would require the inclusion of additional questions and/or explanations and therefore require the allocation of more space than is currently available on the census questionnaire. Responses to the consultation exercise carried out in 2005 in England and Wales on topics for the 2011 census indicated a strong requirement for information on religious affiliation or identification but not on religious practice or religion brought up in.

Details of this consultation can be found at www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp.</p>

<a name="70301w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="07030139000035"></a>It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated, and difficult trade-offs will need to be made. The current working assumption is that we will be using the same religion question in the 2011 census in England and Wales as in the 2001 census and the 2007 census test.</p>

<a name="70301w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="07030139000036"></a>Final decisions on the content of the 2011 census will not be made until the programme of consultation and question testing is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_73"></a><a name="07030139000105"></a>The 2004 ALB review report made public commitments to restructure the department&#146;s ALBs and set the following key deliverables:</p>
a reduction in the number of ALBs from 38 to 20 by 2008;a 25 per cent reduction in the number of posts within the ALB sector by 2008;a redistribution to front-line services of at least &#163;0.5 billion a year by the end of 2007-08, to be made up of &#163;250 million savings on ALB operating costs and a further &#163;250 million from procurement savings by the NHS PASA on behalf of NHS organisations; anda contribution of some 1,000 posts to the Lyons agenda of moving public sector jobs outside London and the greater south-east.

Where furniture needs to be moved regularly, it is mounted on lockable wheels so that any staff can move it easily. For other, bulky and cumbersome furniture, arrangements have been made with porters to move it safely; signs have therefore been posted in some meeting rooms advising staff of this arrangement.</p>
