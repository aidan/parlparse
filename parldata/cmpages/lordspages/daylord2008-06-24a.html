In assessing any such proposal, we would consider its aims and how it might complement existing multilateral organisations and democracy-based groupings, such as the Community of Democracies.</p>

As he is aware, the proposals are currently informal, but they are an interesting concept. Our Prime Minister believes that we need to look again at the range of international institutions and how they can be improved to meet the global challenges that we all face. The Government very much welcome the Question from the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and the questions that will follow, as this is an important matter for debate and one that should be open to new suggestions and ideas; let a thousand flowers bloom.</p>

It is the fag end of the regime change and forced democratisation ideas that led to the invasion of Iraq. Do the Government at least agree, and will they say in public, that our approach to multilateral international institutions should be inclusive rather than exclusive, and that attempting to build an exclusive group of countries to do some of what the United Nations has done before would be highly undesirable?</p>

I am delighted with the Government&#146;s decision to establish a national dementia strategy. Can my noble friend confirm to the House that the proportion of her department's research and development budget allocated to dementia has been less than 3 per cent? If that is so, it is disgraceful. The Government are leaving these lost souls in limbo because without proper provision by her department, they have no voice.

The condition is devastating, which is why we are determined to address those challenges. The department is investing &#163;20 million over five years in the national research network on dementia and neurodegenerative disease, which was launched in 2006. There is already significant government funding in this area&#151;it was close to &#163;25 million in 2005-06. The national dementia strategy, which was launched last Thursday, looks at the priorities with organisations and people who are directly involved in dealing with this condition. Once the strategy is finalised, we will ensure that there are sufficient resources available in overall PCT allocations to deliver on the national and local priorities set out in that strategy.</p>

Training has emerged as a major theme in the development of the national strategy. We need to ensure that basic vocational and professional training provides sufficient expertise in dementia and that continuing professional and vocational training keeps those skills up to date. That is as true for medicine as it is for nurses and social care workers. The strategy&#146;s external reference group, which is chaired by the chief executive of the Alzheimer&#146;s Society, is involved with a range of care people on dementia, including GPs and nurses. We regard this as a priority.</p>

The new deal for carers, which was launched by the Prime Minister on 10 June, is investing a total of &#163;255 million on short-term commitments. The strategy has an ambitious 10-year vision. There is also an increase in the carers&#146; grant, and we are establishing a carers&#146; information and service helpline.

Our 2008 drugs strategy action plan commits us across relevant government departments to consider further the individual and social harms created by khat use. If there is a material adverse change in our understanding, we will ask the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs for further advice on the case for control.</p>

I am sure that he is aware that his Government consulted on the matter in 2005. Indeed, they received a report from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and set up a khat working group. My noble friend Lady Anelay asked this Question in Parliament in 1998. This drug is destroying the Somali, the Yemeni and the Ethiopian communities. Families and young children&#146;s education are being destroyed. If the achievements and aspirations of communities are being denied by not being protected from this drug, the equality of opportunity agenda in this country is not being met for certain communities. This is essential for community cohesion. Will the Minister deal with the matter by classifying this drug?</p>

Indeed, I read an article by her in one of the broadsheets which my wife takes and which we have family disputes about at times. The noble Baroness is absolutely correct that this was looked at in detail in 2005 by the advisory council, Nacro and Turning Point. It was decided at that stage that this would be treated as a public health issue rather than with a criminal justice response. That is the basis on which we have gone ahead. It in no way underestimates the harm that the drug can cause. We believe that the right way to tackle this is prevention, harm reduction and education. We have made great strides, but I do not underestimate what a real risk this drug is.</p>

One difficulty for regulatory authorities is recognising khat. It is imported as a vegetable and is difficult to recognise at points of entry. I must declare an interest as a member of ACMD. On the balance of harms, given that it is difficult to police and does not seem to be related to mainstream criminal activity, there would be more disturbance within the Somali and Yemeni communities by criminalising it than by trying to educate people to avoid the devastating liver disease that ensues.</p>

That was part of the equation in the debate. There is no full consensus in the Somali community about this. However, there is no doubt whatever about the real harm that the drug can cause. It is bought for about $1 a kilo in Kenya and is sold in this country for about &#163;30 to &#163;50 a kilo. It is mainly used by the men in that Somali group, most of whom have come here in the past 12 to 14 years and have tended to go to inner-city areas. It is a real problem, but it would be wrong at the moment to treat it with a criminal justice response. It is right to go about it in the way that we are, but we are continually monitoring the problem. If it should change, we will not hesitate to take action.</p>

Does the noble Lord agree that if you criminalise the drug, as the noble Baroness suggested, the likely result would be to get more people into the courts and prisons without necessarily affecting the import and consumption of this product? Would the right answer be to tax khat, to supervise the establishments in which it is sold and to embark on a public education programme, particularly in the Somali and Yemeni communities?</p>

It is absolutely right that we should treat this as a public health issue. Interestingly, there is no doubt whatever about this. This stuff is brought into the country and people should pay VAT. We have tried to engage with the mafreshi, which are the dens where, I am afraid, men will chew one or two bundles of this stuff in a session. In fact, HMRC are homing in on these places, which is a way of tackling the problem. The proper VAT and such things should be paid, but they are not being paid and those involved have not been good at engaging with us on health and safety and other things, which we need to pursue. I believe that it is still much more a public health issue than a criminal issue, but we will keep reviewing it. Occasionally, for some drugs, there is a case for criminalisation.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08062483000328"></a>&#147;We are particularly worried about recent changes to social care inspection methodology and the reduction in frequency of inspections from annual or twice-yearly inspections to periodic reviews which could be carried out for some providers only every 3 years. In a recent survey of members working in CSCI conducted jointly by our unions, 76% of respondents said they believe this new reduced inspection methodology does not provide a robust assessment of risk to service users, and 81% believe that more frequent inspections are necessary. Our members are telling us that associated cutbacks have meant that inspectors no longer have time to follow up on problems and have far fewer opportunities to meet and listen to service users. We would question whether reducing the &#145;burden&#146; of regulation is appropriate when it affects some of the most vulnerable people utilising health and social care services. This is even more critical at a time when the Government is encouraging a wider variety of providers to enter into the market&#148;.</p>

However, many voices within the profession are expressing concern. The problem of reduced inspection is widely criticised. Some noble Lords may have heard, every morning last week on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, reports by Mr John Manell, a BBC journalist. In a very impressive piece of investigative journalism, he set out to expose conditions, both good and bad, in the social care sector. He drew directly on the comments of inspectors throughout the United Kingdom. His report showed that it was not the commitment of CSCI&#146;s inspectors that was the problem but the ability of CSCI to fulfil its obligations with limited resources.</p>

<a name="80624-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08062483000084"></a>One person interviewed by Mr Manell said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08062483000329"></a>&#147;If a home is made poor, then there is a lot of work that needs to be done by CSCI. But Managers&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000304"></a>that is, CSCI managers&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062483000330"></a>&#147;know that due to the workforce reduction, everyone is under pressure to get the work done and meet targets. So if the home is made adequate inspectors have the time to undertake their planned schedule of inspections&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000305"></a>The same inspector went on to say, in relation to a particular inspection:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08062483000331"></a>&#147;I completed my report and sent it to my manager as required by the CSCI. My manager came back to me and suggested changes to the report. These were to change all the poor ratings to adequate. And the reason? &#145;The care provider is a good provider, they can turn this problem around quickly. So make the overall rating adequate and we can keep them on our side and work with them.&#146; For me the issue was, the care is poor, and if it is poor we need to say it is. However, the pressure that I was under was huge. So against my own judgement, I made the rating adequate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80624-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08062483000085"></a>Another inspector said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08062483000332"></a>&#147;I think my main concerns are that the homes aren&#146;t inspected as frequently as they were before. We rely a lot on information given to us by the providers of a service to say how good that service is. When we actually go out to visit the homes they are completely different to what the proprietors have told us in their feedback to us. So, it may mean that we are not inspecting a home as frequently as we should do because of the information we are receiving about it or the lack of information we are receiving about it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80624-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08062483000086"></a>I was on the Public Accounts Committee throughout the 1980s and remember that sometimes National Audit Office reports that came before our committee at their earliest stage were prompted by whistleblowers; and also, that whistleblowers sometimes have a bad track record. I have no doubt that there are people in the care sector who make reports of malpractice for all sorts of reasons. Perhaps they were subject to a disciplinary procedure, are discontented in their place of work or have been in arguments with management. I recognise that that can be the case with some people who act as whistleblowers to draw the public&#146;s attention to deficiencies in the places where they work. However, that cannot account for all reports in this case.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08062483000334"></a>&#147;The home was poor throughout and needed enforcement action to be taken but the Regulation Manager did not want this to happen&#151;too many poor homes this year&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08062483000309"></a>Changing regimes in a home was a matter we laboured over in Committee.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08062483000090"></a>One inspector was particularly critical when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08062483000338"></a>&#147;To be honest, I wouldn&#146;t leave my dog in 90 per cent of our care homes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000310"></a>However, what I really found disturbing was this. The interviewer said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08062483000339"></a>&#147;I was very concerned about what I was being told so I arranged a meeting with a number of inspectors. I assured them they would remain anonymous but they were becoming increasingly worried about the implications of talking to me. Our meeting was called off. Two other inspectors told me about what they described as a &#145;witch hunt&#146; within the organisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000311"></a>It may be untrue, but this is what the journalist said he was told by an individual inspector:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08062483000340"></a>&#147;I was asked if I knew that the BBC were doing a programme and I said yes. I was then asked if I knew of any colleagues who were or had contemplated speaking to the press. I said no&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000312"></a>The journalist said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08062483000341"></a>&#147;I needed to find out whether what I had been told reflected wider opinion within the Commission for Social Care Inspection. So, I wrote a questionnaire for its employees. Three unions&#151;UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing and Prospect&#151;agreed to allow me to send it to all their members within the Commission. The BBC&#146;s Editor of political research helped ensure the questions were posed fairly and neutrally. More than half of the organisation&#146;s employees would have received it. And 30 per cent of the questionnaires were returned to us. More significantly around a quarter of all inspectors responded&#151;that&#146;s more than 200 of them. Many of the comments we received were, again, disturbing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80624-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08062483000091"></a>I put it to my noble friend that something, somewhere, is wrong. In all these interviews, inspectors talk about the inadequacy of resources, which directly influences inspection. We know about the reduction in resources from a Written Answer to me by my noble friend. In Committee, the noble Baroness from the Liberal Benches and many Cross-Benchers referred specifically to their concern about the amalgamation of these three organisations into one. Everybody was concerned that this part of the budget, covering these areas of inspection, might suffer. Ministers should be equally disturbed at what is happening and what might become worse.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08062483000092"></a>We all know the reality: a good home today can be a bad home tomorrow. It can be due to a change of management, a change of proprietor, a sudden turnover  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1342"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in care staff&#151;particularly in a sector which is notoriously low paid&#151;even a change of chef or the arrival of a bully. CSCI itself tells us that there is a high volume of complaints, including those about shabby homes, incompetent management, bullying, unsafe facilities, clients locked in rooms, clients tied to beds, occasional violence, inadequate monitoring of food intake, shouting by staff through overwork, lack of help with toileting and inadequate medical cover. I am sure that these problems apply only to a minority of homes and that most are excellent, but many are not. That is why we need a regime that maintains the highest possible standard across the board.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08062483000093"></a>The care sector is crying out for greater regulation, not less. A reduction in frequency of inspection would inevitably lead to a reduction in standards. I believe that there needs to be a review of the whole inspectorate system&#146;s resources following the amalgamation. We need a minimum frequency of unannounced visits that is considerably more than the current arrangement.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08062483000094"></a>In responding to this report, CSCI&#146;s chief inspector, Paul Snell, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08062483000342"></a>&#147;The quality ratings, together with our more detailed inspection reports will give current and prospective users of care services and their families every opportunity to check up on the quality of care provided&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000313"></a>Well, I am very sorry, but if the reports are deficient in many areas because the resources are not available to carry out effective inspection, they will not be of much use to those of us who have to place our relatives in institutions of care. I beg to move.</p>

I do so from a background as an inspector in a different organisation but one which worked closely with the then inspector of social services. I must admit that, when joint working, one of the things that concerned me was a tendency to tick-box rather than inspect, particularly when we were inspecting places in which children were held. I stated at an earlier stage my concerns about this merger of the three commissions into one and that there is a danger that, in doing so, the three separate functions of regulation, audit and inspection are being confused. Tick-box methods are perfectly all right for regulation and audit, because that is what they are, but they are not good enough for inspection, which requires detailed examination by experts, followed by judgments. Those are not fuelled by tick-boxes.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08062483000096"></a>I am extremely glad that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, mentioned unannounced inspections. When I was Chief Inspector of Prisons I was meant to inspect every five years, but I did not have the resources for enough teams to do even that. I had to appeal for resources to get a third team in order to get the frequency down to five years. One of the reasons for that was that I insisted that five years was too long and that one needed to insert unannounced inspections during that period, particularly to monitor that the recommendations I had made in the previous inspection were being followed through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08062483000097"></a>It seems extremely unwise, therefore, for any organisation, if it is responsible for something of such sensitivity as care homes, not to include that sort of

That includes people who may have mental and physical frailties and who are in residential care. I have a great deal of sympathy for what the noble Lord is trying to do.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08062483000099"></a>As I said in Committee, however, I do not entirely agree with him because over the past two or three years CSCI inspections have moved on. There was a time when CSCI inspections were, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, primarily tick-box affairs. They have changed quite a lot. The new commission has an unprecedented opportunity to develop a range of inspection methods and to concentrate on that which we know to be the most revealing&#151;unannounced inspections. I know we are not allowed in this House to compromise the independence of the commission in any way but I have one word of advice for its new chair. I hope that one of the first appointments is that wonderful lady who was part of those very revealing programmes on Radio 4. I am very sorry, I cannot remember her name. She is the actress who mugs up and goes into old people's homes. She has probably done more to protect vulnerable people than just about anybody else. I hope that she and a load of people like her are on the CQC&#146;s books very quickly. I think that they would do more than anything else to raise standards.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08062483000100"></a>Mr Paul Snell, in response to the points made about CSCI, pointed out that it is trying to concentrate inspection and remedial action on the minority of homes that are poor performers. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is absolutely right: this whole system depends on having complaints procedures that are sufficiently robust and on ensuring that carers and members of the public can bring poor practice to the commission's attention. The commission relies on having good inspectors, and the noble Lord talked about professionals. I would not use that word. I have watched lay inspectors be far harsher on service providers than my fellow professionals would be. There also has to be a system to protect whistleblowers. Many years ago there was not a system but now there is. Finally, there has to be a means by which service users can be part of that circle of information, flagging things up and following through the report&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08062483000101"></a>I do not disagree with the noble Lord&#146;s motivation at all. I want to see poor service providers hounded mercilessly until they either change or go out of business. On the contrary, I want to see good providers enabled to get on with their job. I shall give one reason why I think he may be wrong. He said that care standards can change when the regime changes in a care home, which is true, but ownership can change also for benign reasons. Contracts end and are given elsewhere. We do not want to spend the inspectorate's limited resources gumming up the works of people who are

But neither do we want to take away from the commission&#146;s the ability to put out of business those who should not be in it in the first place.

It is fundamentally important that any home that falls into poor practice should be visited and dealt with fast. My request to Ministers has to do with LINks, which we discussed under the local government Bill. We do not want a lot of duplication of visitors to homes; they have enough to do as it is. However, if the Minister would consider putting into regulations something about the CQC working with LINks and ensuring that if, for example, there is a change of management or there are complaints or concerns about a home, the CQC can get on to LINks and ensure that a visit is made by a LINk and a report made to the CQC, then that would be an inexpensive way of doing things and a very effective way for LINks to operate. In Committee, I and, I think, other noble Lords were concerned that LINks really got stuck into the areas of greatest neglect and greatest need. I would argue that this is where such needs are: small homes for very vulnerable people. I suggested that they did not have to be bothered too much with the big hospitals, because there are all sorts of people visiting those, but there are incredibly vulnerable people in these tiny homes. If noble Lords would consider this, I really do think it could be a major contribution to improving the quality of services for these very vulnerable people.</p>

I am sure that it upset many of us because it confirmed some of our worst fears about what might be going on. I very much support what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said, which was followed up my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08062483000104"></a>I still have a concern. Where local authorities are involved with some overall responsibility for small homes, surely another way in which a slightly broader view could be taken is through the elected members and not just the staff. If an elected member of a local authority befriended a particular small nursing or residential home with the ability to go in and out at differing times, that would have a much greater effect on the standard of care because of the local accountability. That may be totally inappropriate because of the existence of LINks and the new organisation which can do it all. But they have been turned over and changed so many times that one is left with quite a degree of doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08062483000108"></a>First, I say gently to my noble friend Lady Howe that we have to remember that these establishments are people&#146;s homes. Many people in them intensely dislike strangers, as they see them, coming in and out. I know that it is quite difficult to get volunteers to be consistent in their approach, having tried to do so in a number for which I am responsible in a different capacity.

However, that does not mean I do not accept that, from time to time, there are issues in particular homes. We should also look at the background of the making of the BBC programme, which has some interesting flaws.

I have listened to and considered his concerns very carefully. We fully appreciate that those who live in care homes are particularly vulnerable. The Care Quality Commission will have a vital role of ensuring that those who receive social care are safe. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, gave a very good account of what the CQC needs to be aiming for. She is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08062483000112"></a>As we have previously discussed, there is no intention to reduce the total amount of inspection activity. Indeed, we want to create a regulator that focuses its attention where it is needed most to get the greatest benefits in terms of safety and quality for patients and service users. At the same time, the commission needs to allow&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said&#151;good providers to get on and deliver their services. This is in the interests of everyone, but particularly service users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08062483000113"></a>In response to some of the concerns, I shall quote Paul Snell, chief inspector of the CSCI. He recently said:</p>

And we&#146;re seeing some real improvement in relation to poor services&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000314"></a>The programme referred to by several noble Lords did not reflect the whole story, as some people have said. As my noble friend admitted, most care homes are excellent. Therefore, while I do not believe that it will

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08062483000114"></a>Several noble Lords referred to LINks. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, that they have a great role to play. As noble Lords may recall, we discussed LINks on the first day on Report last week, and have introduced an amendment that makes&#151;if noble Lords will excuse me&#151;the link between LINks and the CQC, and highlights the need for them to work together and for LINks to send reports to the CQC. I have no doubt that LINks will play an important role in ensuring that the CQC takes users&#146; and the public&#146;s voices seriously. They also have access and can arrive unannounced where appropriate.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08062483000115"></a>I regret that I am unable to accept these amendments. We currently intend to leave these decisions to the discretion of the commission, and provision already exists to set specific frequencies if required. I hope that I have been able to reassure my noble friend that the Bill will allow the new commission to take action where it is needed, and that it gives the commission powers to encourage services to improve and focus attention on the poor services that fail to meet those requirements. I therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw these amendments.</p>

I press my noble friend on one thing. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referred to the need for the CQC to work with LINks. Will my noble friend impress that principle on this new organisation and perhaps come back to us at Third Reading? She may then have the opportunity to comment further on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08062483000117"></a>My noble friend said that there was no intention to reduce inspection. My amendment is not about the reduction of inspection, but increasing it and securing more resources for this inspectorate. A lot of people have answered the BBC&#146;s questionnaire. They are lying, telling the truth or exaggerating. From listening to  the interviews, many believe that they are reflecting the reality. If they are, there is something wrong within the inspectorate. Nothing my noble friend has said suggests that the Government intend to find out whether there is any truth in what is being said about problems within the inspectorate. I ask my noble friend to arrange for those inquiries to be carried out. I would like to know whether those allegations or true or false. There is no need for the Minister to reassure us now, because I hope that she will come back to this at Third Reading. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08062483000122"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 34, 36, 37, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52 and 54, as well as to Amendment No. 38, tabled by my noble friend Lord Warner. The government amendments in this group are in response to concerns raised in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08062483000123"></a>It is quite right that a regulator&#146;s first priority should be the safety of people who use the service, so patient and user safety will be the Care Quality Commission&#146;s prime concern. However, the commission will, of course, also make a wider contribution to driving up the quality of health and adult social care services. Through its powers to undertake reviews and to publish reports, it will publish independent information about the performance of providers and commissioners, which will inform patient choice and create an incentive for organisations to improve quality.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08062483000124"></a>The Government have been clear throughout that commissioning is definitely within the scope of the new regulator&#146;s reviews and investigation functions. However, we acknowledged in Grand Committee that the Bill could be clearer, so I am pleased to bring forward government amendments that are intended to provide that clarity. I am delighted that my noble friend has been satisfied enough that these meet his concerns to be happy to withdraw the majority of his planned further amendments on commissioning.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08062483000125"></a>Amendments Nos. 32 and 34 make it explicit that the new regulator must conduct periodic reviews of care commissioned by primary care trusts or by local authorities. Amendments Nos. 50, 51, 52 and 54 relate to the definitions of NHS care and adult social services in Clause 92, which are used throughout Part 1 of the Bill. The amendments make it clear that the same applies to special reviews and investigations under Clause 44, as well as standards under Clause 41, advice to the Secretary of State under Clause 49 and inspections under Clause 56. For completeness, because Clause 60 does not use those specific definitions, government Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 clarify that the regulator&#146;s powers to require information also extend to anyone providing care commissioned by PCTs or local authorities.</p>

<a name="80624-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08062483000126"></a>It is also helpful to put on the record points about what the Care Quality Commission&#146;s periodic reviews, and special reviews and investigations under Clause 44, can cover in respect of commissioning. As an example, a review could ask whether a PCT had assessed the health needs of its population and consider whether those needs were being met. Similarly, as we discussed in relation to Amendment No. 33, the new regulator&#146;s reviews may cover how well local authorities are carrying out their duty to assess the needs of those who appear to them to need adult social services and, therefore, how well they are commissioning services for those who meet the eligibility criteria. The regulator&#146;s reviews or investigations could also consider value for money of commissioned care, quality, availability and access, and overall care outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08062483000127"></a>A particular concern, put most eloquently by my noble friend, was that we should make it clear that the new Care Quality Commission could have a role in helping strategic health authorities to intervene&#151;to  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1348"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>administer the red card&#151;against a PCT that was failing to commission adequate services. I hope that my noble friend will allow me to say a few words on Amendment No. 38 before he speaks to it. The amendment seeks to address this issue, proposing that, if reviews identify failings in commissioning, the commission itself should be able to require SHAs to take action.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08062483000128"></a>We are now in a phase of organisational stability for the NHS&#151;this was recently reinforced with the launch of the next-stage review&#151;which also requires a more hands-on role for SHAs in the context of the world-class commissioning assurance process and the performance management of PCTs. As such, strategic health authorities continue to have the key performance management role here, and this is where it should stay, rather than sit with the new regulator. The Secretary of State and strategic health authorities have significant powers to intervene if PCTs are failing in their commissioning role.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08062483000129"></a>The document <I>Developing the NHS Performance Regime</I>, published on 4 June, sets out how the various elements of the NHS performance regime, including the role of the Care Quality Commission, fit together. The document focuses, in particular, on the role of strategic health authorities as performance managers of PCT commissioners. Where a challenged PCT fails to demonstrate recovery, intervention on behalf of the NHS chief executive may include replacement of the PCT board, outsourcing some or all of the PCT functions, or even takeover of the organisation by another PCT. The document also sets out our proposals to develop a system for the Department of Health&#146;s assurance of the strategic health authorities themselves.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08062483000130"></a>Our amendments requiring the Care Quality Commission to consider whether it should advise and make recommendations where it finds failings as part of its special reviews will allow the commission to recommend which actions should be taken. The Bill will also give the commission considerable new powers to intervene directly where service providers are failing to provide services to an acceptable standard.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08062483000131"></a>Noble Lords sought clarification of what action the commission could take about problems across care pathways or resulting from poor commissioning strategies that it might identify as a result of its reviews, including special reviews or investigations under Clause 44, where it will not have powers to intervene directly. The regulator will, of course, be able to express any specific concerns that it may have about the quality of commissioning, either in its reports published as a result of the reviews under Clauses 42 and 44, or in specific advice to the Secretary of State under Clause 49. Having listened closely to the debates on this issue, we have brought forward Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 to clarify that, following a special review or investigation, the regulator must consider whether the report raises issues on which it should advise the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08062483000132"></a>I sincerely hope that my noble friend will agree that our government amendments give the clarity that he and other noble Lords were seeking. I beg to move.</p>

I have to move it so that I can say what I want to say. I am grateful to the Minister for responding so positively to the concerns that I expressed in Grand Committee about what I thought was the Bill&#146;s lack of clarity over the ability of the commission to review and inspect against standards in relation to the commissioners of services. I accept the argument that the Government made then that it would be wrong to require commissioning to be a registrable activity. That would, in my view, lock the commission and the PCTs into unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08062483000134"></a>Amendments Nos. 32, 34, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52 and 54 meet most of my concerns, I have to acknowledge, in a rather more elegant and comprehensive way than my own amendment. I would, however, like clarification and reassurance on Amendment No. 52. As I read it, it has the effect of applying the standard-setting power in Clause 41 to commissioning as well as to the provision of health services. That is an important change and means that the Secretary of State will be setting standards for commissioning under Clause 41 that the commission can inspect and review performance against in terms of PCTs. The Government&#146;s original position was for guidelines rather than setting standards under Clause 41. As I understand this amendment, it brings the standards in relation to commissioners on a par with standard setting under Clause 41 for providers, but I would like reassurance from my noble friend. If he wrote to me on that, I would be quite satisfied.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08062483000135"></a>On my Amendment No. 38, as I said in Grand Committee, if we are running a risk-based regulatory system&#151;as we will be&#151;it has to apply to commissioning as well as to the provision of health services. Commissioners can do more damage to a community&#146;s health through ineptitude than nearly all, if not all, providers. The registration system has a series of sanctions that can be applied to providers&#151;the Bill provides for that and is very clear about it&#151;as does Monitor in relation to foundation trusts. I am not completely convinced by all my noble friend&#146;s arguments. I accept everything that he says about the performance management responsibilities of the strategic health authorities. No one is arguing&#151;I am not arguing&#151;that the SHAs do not have a responsibility to ensure that the world-class commissioning initiative, which I fully support, is applied and to address shortcomings in commissioning.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08062483000136"></a>My concern is based on history; I have often thought that history is one of the best predictors of future behaviour. In the past, there has been a considerable reluctance on the part of the NHS, and often of the Department of Health and Ministers, to act when commissioners are failing. They are much more willing to act when providers are failing. The Bill is strongly focused on providers, with a registration system and a set of sanctions accordingly.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08062483000137"></a>I do not want to put the noble Baroness, Lady Young, in a difficult position in her future relationships with Ministers and SHAs, but there is an issue about whether, in the Bill, the commission should be able to require some action from the performance managers  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1350"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the PCTs when there are failures of commissioning. We know that there have been quite a lot of failures of commissioning in many of these areas. Many of the hospitals that have got into financial difficulties and are letting down patients and producing unsafe services are in that position because the commissioners let them get into it; they facilitated a failing health economy in their area. My concern is that we have to allow the commission to be able to require action, as it is able to do in relation to providers. The action would very much focus on the strategic health authorities.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08062483000138"></a>I accept most of the arguments that my noble friend has made and I can see that I may appear churlish and ungrateful in relation to the Government&#146;s response. This is an extremely important issue, which we have not yet totally cracked. I would like to hear what my noble friend has to say in response. In the mean time, I beg to move Amendment No. 38.</p>

On Clause 60, who would have guessed that &#147;pursuant to arrangements made&#148; turns out to mean &#147;commissioned&#148;? That is a great improvement.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08062483000142"></a>I shall speak in support of Amendment No. 38, only as an addition to the clarification that we have already had. I am almost persuaded that the  problem of giving the CQC intervention powers with commissioners is the difficulty of cutting across the strategic health authorities&#146; intervention powers as managers. It is a pity that this is the case, because I am rather a nostalgic fan of commissioning, having been the first chief executive of any commissioning health authority back in 1990. I have never really given up hope that commissioning health authorities will be the force that we had originally hoped that they would be but which they have so far singularly failed to become. Although primary care trusts are developing, they have not yet had the influence on the shape of health services in their local communities for individuals and families that we had hoped for, but I have not given up hope that they will have such influence. It would be an important signal to say that they are as important as providers&#151;quite often more so&#151;in shaping how a set of circumstances rolls out and produces disaster for the patient or recipient of a service in the end.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08062483000143"></a>The CQC should have the ability to show the red card or the yellow card&#151;I am not sure which colour it should be. It must have the ability to point out that things are going amiss and that strategic health authorities do not always grasp their responsibility to remove or reshape the boards of primary care trusts in the way that they should. It is a pity that there is not some greater pressure that we could exert; this is our one

I was rather sorry about that. Despite the amendments in this group in the name of the Minister, to whom I have listened carefully and whom I thank for his consideration of the points raised in Committee, the amendments originally tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, would have achieved something materially and importantly different from those we are invited to approve.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08062483000145"></a>Clause 42, as the Government now wish to amend it, will state that the commission will be given the duty to,</p>

<p><a name="08062483000317"></a>The clause is still focused on the provider end of care rather than also on the commissioning activity, notwithstanding the insertion of the words &#147;commissioned by&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08062483000146"></a>I hope that the Minister will not mind if I press him, but the legal interpretation of the clause as amended will definitely enable the CQC to review and assess the quality of commissioners and their commissioning as opposed to just the services commissioned. There is a difference, which Amendment No. 54 seems to confirm. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08062483000345"></a>&#147;Any reference in this Part to health care commissioned by a Primary Care Trust is a reference to health care provided by other persons pursuant to arrangements made by the Trust&#148;.</p>

However, I do not think that it takes us quite as far as we need to go, which is why I have added my support to Amendment No. 38 and why I agree very much with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. Amendment No. 38 captures the very important and specific issue of the interrelationship between the CQC and strategic health authorities. It acknowledges explicitly that the responsibility for performance management of PCTs as commissioners, while vested in strategic health authorities, is one in which the CQC will be able to assist and support in its reviewing role. Shortcomings in commissioning may not always be apparent to a strategic health authority through its standard performance management processes, so I am sure that this is an area of the CQC&#146;s work that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is right to highlight and which the Minister perhaps ought to take away and consider again.</p>

<a name="08062483000150"></a><a name="80624-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80624-0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08062483000499"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Warner for his considered comments and for taking us through Amendment No. 38. He is right when it comes to the history of commissioning, which is why I made the point that we need to remind ourselves that most PCTs are barely 18 months old. We need to give them maturity in establishing their commissioning competencies. Historically, one way of dealing with poor commissioning was restructuring, but we have made a commitment that there will be no further restructuring. However, I agree with noble Lords who made the point that we should build up competencies of commissioning. There is the publication of the Department of Health on the assurance system, to which I referred earlier, but also a failure regime for commissioning, details on the rules and how we set the bar in measuring the quality of commissioning.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08062483000151"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of the balance between provision and commissioning. Reviews of PCTs will look at commissioning functions as closely as at the provider function. Some aspects of the commissioning functions that will be part of these reviews are: value for money in commissioned care, in other words whether the PCT has made good use of the resources available to it; quality of commissioning, for example whether the care commissioned by the PCT is of high quality and achieving good health outcomes for individuals using it; the availability of commissioning, in other words whether the PCT has purchased enough healthcare to meet the needs of its population and whether waiting times are within the national standard of 18 weeks; and finally&#151;I feel this will probably be more important in the future&#151;overall health outcomes, in other words whether the PCT has succeeded in improving the overall health of its population by reaching out to those in most need. Those are the type of competencies that a mature PCT in the future will have responsibility for, and, more importantly, through the assurance regime it will be assessed on whether it is meeting those needs.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08062483000152"></a>The answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is yes. I am delighted that, having considered our amendments, in particular Amendments Nos. 36 and 37, my noble friend Lord Warner has agreed that we are striking the right balance of responsibilities between the commission and the Secretary of State and that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I have not yet withdrawn my amendment, but as we have got to this point in the discussion I think that I can say a few more words. I do not want to get into an historical debate with the Minister, but I used the term &#147;commissioners&#148;. Commissioners, as I recall, were around before this Government were in office. There was an NHS market from Ken Clarke&#146;s days, and there were commissioners; they were simply not called primary care trusts. There has therefore been a history of commissioning for some time. Many PCTs have been around for five or six years rather than for 18 months, so we have quite a spread of experience of commissioning from which to draw.</p>

<a name="80624-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08062483000166"></a>The harsh reality is that, when push comes to shove with rather powerful acute hospitals, commissioners often back down. They simply do not take the action necessary to balance provision of health services in their area. I in no way disagree with the Minister or with the Government&#146;s position on the performance management role of the strategic health authorities. However, when Alan Johnson published the document about the new regulatory system in October 2007, he very clearly said&#151;I referred to this in Grand Committee&#151;that commissioning was a shared responsibility between strategic health authorities and the commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08062483000167"></a>The Minister has graciously moved a long way to get commissioning properly established in the Bill. I apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, if I marched him up to the top of the hill and marched him down again by withdrawing my amendments, but I do think that the Government have moved a long way in these areas and I am comfortable with their amendments. However, I still come back to the question of who can take the action to push the SHAs where there is evidence of a failure of commissioning in a particular geographical area. I am still concerned about this. I probably used &#147;red card&#148; inappropriately. I bow to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and her superior knowledge of soccer; a yellow card was probably the appropriate analogy.</p>

I should repeat that I do not have a background in social care. My background is in industry, so I come to this debate as a consumer.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1355"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08062483000176"></a>Like most people who are faced with placing a relative in care, I found myself submerged in glossy brochures from many providers. It was a particularly difficult decision to take, which was not helped by the unwillingness of social services departments to guide or advise on where a self-funder could find the best. It was also not helped by the fact that only one&#151;a BUPA home&#151;out of the 19 homes I visited volunteered the CSCI report. In Committee, I reported that I had visited 19 establishments.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08062483000177"></a>Some homes were a disgrace, some were very good and some stank of urine. One in central London was appalling and some others appeared cosmetically to be little better. I cannot imagine what was going on behind the scenes. As a Member of Parliament until 2001, I had been vaguely aware of an inspection regime. I should have been aware of the CSCI inspection report system, but I was not. Subsequently, I found out that that is the case for most others in my position. We all find out after placing someone in a home, but often that is too late.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08062483000178"></a>I am convinced that most relatives who are placing&#151;certainly self-funders&#151;have no idea how to choose. Thankfully, after many unannounced visits to homes, I found a first-class institution, with a first-class CSCI report, where my mother is very happy. However, I repeatedly ask myself how many others have been in a position to tour the south of England visiting homes unannounced like I did. I suspect that that would be a minority of people, yet they are paying fees of anything between &#163;800 and &#163;1,200 a week, which is equal to &#163;100,000 per annum pre-tax annual income. That is a lot of money.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08062483000179"></a>There needs to be far easier access to independent information about homes and greater transparency. Some would argue that nursing home websites should carry or refer to the availability of their CSCI reports. Last week, if I recall correctly, my noble friend undertook to refer that matter to the new chairman of the Care Quality Commission, particularly the issue of the websites of homes being required to refer people to the CSCI report.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08062483000180"></a>Under Amendment No. 40, there would be a statutory responsibility on providers to provide information of an independent nature on home standards and conditions in an easily comprehendible form to prospective clients or their representatives. It would place on the home&#146;s management a statutory obligation to provide that information in a place that is accessible to the public. It would help choice and create the conditions for raising standards. It would deal with the seven assessment headings set out under the national minimum standards for care using the scoring system, but it should also flag up in a more informative way information on kitchen cleanliness standards from local authority inspection reports under Section 32 of the Food Safety Act; information on staff turnover; staff-to-client ratios with benchmark guidance; weekend cover arrangements; the use of bank staff; access to outside recreational areas; the frequency of case reviews; the dates of previous CSCI inspections; the complaints procedure; the role of the key carer and named nurse; personal and room cleaning arrangements; the incidence of   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1356"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>medication errors and of accidents; the number of individuals who make complaints; and information on sickness absence, all of which can indicate stress levels.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08062483000181"></a>I have gone into these areas in detail because these are the issues which arise. As I said in Committee, I placed my mum, but I have also been to many homes since that placement because I have found this area fascinating. Other professionals may have another view about what is important, but as a consumer I believe that these are important issues. The BUPA care home checklist system provides us with some guidance on what potential clients are looking for over and above the existing CSCI inspection report arrangements. What would be the effect on home management of being required to put the report in a place which was accessible to people coming in, where they could see it and be guided towards it?</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08062483000182"></a>Staff would find themselves more openly accountable. Many carers are unaware of the availability of CSCI reports. I find that worrying because they do not realise the extent to which they are already accountable as individuals. I am talking about people who might be on &#163;6 or &#163;7 an hour, even less sometimes. Some people in these homes are incredibly poorly paid. Management would be ever conscious of the greater access to this information by potential clients and would be inclined to avoid poor scoring in a highly competitive market. In other words, standards would, in my view, inevitably rise. Relatives would have a checklist against which they could refer in times of concern without having to go to home managers which, in itself, can often be full of difficulties.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08062483000183"></a>I know this is controversial. I have discussed this with a number of home managers. Some believe it is a very good idea, because they know that the poorer homes avoid at all costs revealing the contents of these standard reports. Many homes would not want it. It might affect their ability to attract custom, but then, so be it. They would have to raise their standards to attract the custom. It would inevitably lead to higher standards and in the long run would make the task of inspecting homes far simpler for the inspectorate. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08062483000188"></a>The Bill already requires the commission to publish inspection reports under Clause 57(3), and Clause 80 requires the commission to make its reports available to the public, just as the current commissions do. I expect that, as now, reports will be available via the commission&#146;s website and the public will also be able to request hard copies. The same would apply to the findings of assessments under Clauses 42 or 45, or indeed of any other review or investigation that the commission might undertake. In addition, under Clause 54 the commission will be able to make available to the public any information that it holds about the provision of NHS care, adult social services or other regulated activities. The commission will make available a wide range of information on providers to the public, users, potential users and their families, to support them in making informed choices.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08062483000189"></a>As I said earlier, we will consult on the detail of regulations under Clause 16, but there is scope for them to include a requirement such as this. Indeed, once regulations under Clause 85 are in place, the public will be able to access information about how the commission is using the new powers to tackle providers that are failing to meet the necessary requirements.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08062483000190"></a>From that combination of reassurances, I hope that my noble friend will feel that we want to ensure that the public, potential users and their families can access as much information as possible about the services they use, from an independent source that they can trust. The current commissions place great emphasis on that and we want the Care Quality Commission to build on their good work. I hope that he will therefore agree to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08062483000200"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I return without apology to an important set of issues debated in Grand Committee on the potential for conflict in the roles of the CQC and Monitor. The Bill provides the CQC with intervention powers that can be exercised in relation to NHS foundation trusts. In doing that, it will oblige NHS foundation trusts to report to two regulators&#151;the CQC and Monitor&#151;whose powers overlap, and where the statutory underpinning for those powers provides no basis for separating their respective accountabilities.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08062483000201"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and others argued powerfully in Grand Committee that this will not do. Effective regulation demands, above all, clarity as to where roles and responsibilities lie. It also demands that one regulator is accountable for performance in a given area. In the case of NHS foundation trusts, having two regulators will achieve the opposite. It is a recipe for duplication and delay. As was argued in Grand Committee, there are strong reasons for Monitor   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1359"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>retaining the primary accountability for NHS foundation trusts. In assessing the performance of foundation trusts, Monitor can look across the piece not only at service quality, but also at financial performance. Its powers are wide-ranging; much more so than those proposed for the CQC. Monitor&#146;s compliance regime has, by common consent, already proved effective. There is absolutely no sense in altering it.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08062483000202"></a>We all understand that there have to be common standards across all NHS bodies. However, that is not the same thing as arguing that the same body must be responsible for enforcement of standards in all cases. As the noble Baroness said in our earlier debates, the regulatory regimes for foundation trusts and other NHS providers are simply different. What is wrong with respecting that difference? Put another way, what is right about putting foundation trusts at risk of double jeopardy? The Bill requires the CQC and Monitor to co-operate with each other and to share information. I have considered this carefully and simply cannot persuade myself that those provisions are enough. The two bodies can co-operate, but  they can still duplicate each other&#146;s roles; they  can share information, but still cause confusion  and unnecessary burdens for the management of foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08062483000203"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, argued in Grand Committee that the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08062483000395"></a>&#147;requires no further amendment to achieve an effective working relationship between Monitor and the Care Quality Commission&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/5/08; col. GC342.]</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000319"></a>She said that the two bodies would simply have to work out for themselves what their relationship should be. With great respect, I do not think that that approach is adequate. It is a cop-out. Why is it not possible to define in statute precisely where the respective responsibilities of the CQC and Monitor should begin and end? Why are the Government avoiding clarity in this area and leaving open the possibility that foundation trusts could find themselves subject to duplicated intervention and duplicated enforcement?</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08062483000204"></a>I make clear that the amendment, as tabled, is not intended as a substitute for proper legal delineation, which clearly needs to be drafted by government lawyers. In my respectful submission, it is merely a means of flagging up some of the adverse consequences of the Bill as drafted. I hope that the Minister will agree to think again about these issues. I beg to move.</p>

He has put a powerful case for clarity about the respective roles of Monitor and the CQC. We have a pretty good arrangement now, because the Healthcare Commission is in effect the inspectorate and feeds information to Monitor, which is clearly the regulator. I, too, find it difficult to understand why, in the case of foundation trusts, the CQC could not perform the same inspecting function, taking data from foundation trusts, as the Healthcare Commission does now, but leaving the regulatory sanctions role clearly with Monitor. I strongly support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and sincerely hope that Ministers will think again about the absolute importance of clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08062483000206"></a>Information is another potential source of confusion between the two bodies. I suggest that a small amendment might be made to the amendment to remove the word &#147;their&#148;. The amendment requires the CQC to promote the efficient and effective use of its own resources. If we removed &#147;their&#148;, the amendment would require the CQC to promote the efficient and effective use of resources. Let me explain why I think that change could be helpful. In a sense, this is about duplication of functions.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08062483000207"></a>The Healthcare Commission and Monitor have worked well to try to ensure that they do not duplicate the demands for information from provider trusts. Each provider trust has to provide information to the Department of Health, Monitor, the Healthcare Commission, perhaps three, four or five primary care trusts&#151;each of which may demand information in a slightly different way&#151;and local authorities. That is an enormously complex set-up. I thought that I would illustrate the point by bringing with me a few pages of our targets from Monitor, the Healthcare Commission, the PCTs, and so on. We are not talking about a few lines of information but an enormously complex set of demands that every provider trust across the country has to tussle with. Each set of demands is not included in the demands of the above organisation, so there is far more to it than at first appears. If these demands are co-ordinated, it is just about manageable. However, it is not difficult to imagine a new, incoming organisation hurling out a lot of demands for information without fully taking on board the impact that would have on all the other demands. The information then has to be collated, entered on to computer, analysed, tabulated and put into documents that people can understand.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08062483000208"></a>I strongly support the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but argue that there is a bit more to this aspect. It is not just a question of double jeopardy in relation to sanctions.</p>

My support relates to our previous discussion about inspection. The bodies would have to co-operate over resources for inspection. One aspect of resourcing inspection is that it is inevitable that where those resources come from will have a bearing on people&#146;s perception of independence. If it is felt that inspection will take place depending on how many resources are put at the disposal of the inspectors by people who have to co-operate over what resources are made available, I fear that there could be problems. Therefore, I hope that before this co-operation on resources takes place, resources for inspection will be ring-fenced so that they are not subject to the negotiation which is the subject of this part of the Bill and of the noble Earl&#146;s amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1361"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>collective memory of that great and august organisation, the Department of Health, is less good than it might be, so it is worth dwelling on this issue. In some ways, it was the forerunner of the move to merge the three regulators. Way back in 2003, there was great concern across the political spectrum at the demands being made on the NHS in relation to information from regulators of various kinds, including central government. I brought together all these various characters, including the medical royal colleges which were also making quite a lot of demands both in their inspection and data collection. A concordat was agreed in which people would co-operate a bit more about the collection of data and to reduce the Piccadilly Circus effect of one inspector following another inspector&#151;as one went out of one door, another would come in through the front door. That is a real issue for an organisation like the NHS.</p>

<a name="80624-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08062483000211"></a>The second point is what I think I said at an earlier stage&#151;the tendency of regulators to mission creep. This is bad news for people delivering operational services. There are issues about who has precedence and whose information is used by whom in the area between the Care Quality Commission and Monitor. I am not sure that legislation is the way to deal with that: indeed, I suspect that it is not. The reason I am standing up here, however, is to try to get the message across to my noble friends on the Front Bench that there is an issue for the department to grapple with in terms of the expectations that it sets for the two regulators.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08062483000212"></a>I am not in any doubt, having been the person who moved the foundation trust legislation in this House back in 2003, that, at the end of the day, the right person to take action on removing authority to continue to provide services is Monitor. The licensing system has worked well. There have been good working relationships between the Healthcare Commission and Monitor. They know where they stand. I hope we can continue that kind of relationship, but I think it will require action on the part of Department of Health Ministers to set the expectations on how those regulators might behave.</p>

We of course want to ensure that public money is put to best use and the work of the two regulators, both of which have roles in healthcare, is co-ordinated. This co-ordination will not only make the most of the resources but, more importantly, it will help to ensure that there is no duplication in the actions each body takes with respect to foundation trusts.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08062483000214"></a>Your Lordships have debated two issues. The first is the clarity of the purpose of the two regulators and the second is if there is any duplication in their function. With regard to clarity of purpose, I remind noble Lords what was said in Committee and also in response to the consultation document which was published in October 2007. We said that we expect the CQC and Monitor to work closely together especially when imposing sanctions or taking enforcement actions. For example,   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1362"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the Care Quality Commission responds to a safety or a quality failing within a foundation trust with a warning notice, the Care Quality Commission will notify Monitor to ensure that it is aware of its concerns. While the foundation trust will be responsible for delivering the necessary improvements, Monitor will work with the NHS foundation trust to ensure compliance because it will be concerned about the impact of the enforcement action on the NHS foundation trust&#146;s ability to operate.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08062483000215"></a>It is unfair to compare what the Healthcare Commission does now and what the CQC will do in the future. The CQC will have an enforcement function and we are trying to find the adequate framework in which Monitor and the CQC will work together.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08062483000216"></a>We believe that the duty to co-operate in Clause 66 will lead to the commission and Monitor establishing a good working relationship. I should like to set out other aspects of the legislation that support the intention behind this amendment. First, under Clause 63, the commission is required to,</p>
<ul><a name="08062483000396"></a>&#147;promote the effective co-ordination of reviews or assessments&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000320"></a>This provision is intended to ensure that the commission works with other public bodies, such as Monitor, when planning reviews and assessments, in order to avoid duplication and ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently. Monitor is already required to exercise its functions effectively, efficiently and economically under paragraph 16 of Schedule 8 to the National Health Service Act 2006.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08062483000217"></a>Schedule 4 provides for the commission's interactions with other authorities. It can act jointly with other public bodies and provide advice and assistance to other public authorities. Furthermore, the Secretary of State may specify public bodies in addition to the inspection authorities that the commission must co-operate with for the efficient and effective exercise of its functions. Therefore, if the Secretary of State considered it necessary, he could make an order specifying Monitor. However, we do not consider that that will be necessary given the provision in Clause 66.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08062483000218"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked what the Government would do about the computers. I am always amazed when people think that each organisation that provides health and social care will have two computers, one for CQC and one for Monitor. The whole purpose of the provision is to create intelligent information that will be available to all sorts of public bodies involved in regulation, regardless of whether it is financial regulation or regulation of the quality of care provided. However, Clause 64, which was a government amendment in the other place, is intended to avoid the duplication of information collection alluded to earlier.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08062483000219"></a>Both Monitor and CQC have to produce annual accounts and a report on how they have exercised their functions. These reports must be laid before Parliament, and there is an independent scrutiny of the accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who must also lay his report before Parliament.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08062483000220"></a>I therefore believe that the Bill contains adequate provision to ensure the effective and efficient use of resources by these two bodies. However, if noble Lords feel that we can do better, I will be more than happy to listen between now and the next stage.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="08062483000379"></a> Clause 95, page 47, line 20, at end insert &#147;, provided that the number of lay members and the number of professionally qualified members shall in all cases be equal&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80624-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08062483000249"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this straightforward amendment has arisen directly from our debates in Grand Committee. It concerns the composition of fitness-to-practise panels in the OHPA. Clause 95 says that a fitness-to-practise panel must consist of a chair, a lay member, a professionally qualified member and,</p>
<ul><a name="08062483000397"></a>&#147;such additional members (if any) selected from the lay members list or the professionally qualified members list as may be required by rules&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000321"></a>My only problem is that it leaves open the question of equality of representation. As the wording stands, the OHPA could assemble a panel comprising a majority either of doctors or of lay people. There may currently be no intention to do that, but I question whether it is appropriate to leave this issue to be decided by the rules of the OHPA.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08062483000250"></a>In creating the OHPA we are surely attempting to establish a body which commands the confidence of the public, as well as the confidence and respect of doctors. For me, at least, that objective of necessity requires a balance of lay and professional members. To unbalance the make-up of the panel in either direction would risk jeopardising the public standing of the OHPA. This is not likely to change over time. Either the balance of confidence is important or it is not. If it is, there is scope for the Government, with the benefit of advice from the GMC, to reconsider the wisdom of this provision. I beg to move.</p>

I declare an interest: from 1982 to 1989 I was president of the General Medical Council and, under the rules then obtaining, I regularly chaired fitness-to-practise panels in the old disciplinary committee. Almost invariably there was an unequal number of professional and lay members. Professional members were in the majority, but almost invariably they took a much harsher view of the problems of which the respondent doctor was accused, whereas the lay people nearly always tended towards lenience.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1366"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08062483000252"></a>However, that is, of course, old history. The Minister may now say that this issue is not to be enshrined in primary legislation but governed by rules. In those days, rules made by the General Medical Council had to be approved by the Privy Council. Those were the days when the medical profession and its regulatory authority cherished their independence from government, regarding the Privy Council as a crucial barrier between them and Big Brother in the Department of Health.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08062483000253"></a>Now the rules are to be made by the OHPA. Will the Minister clarify whether they are simply rules it can make without reference to any other body, or whether they must be approved by the Department of Health? Also, the crucial principle of parity between lay and professional members on fitness-to-practise panels will mean a great deal to members of the medical profession; the clause also applies to the optical profession.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08062483000254"></a>I therefore support the principle underlying the amendment, believing that parity between professionals and lay people is essential. Lay people must be included, following the decisions of Dame Janet Smith in her report and the change in regulation now embodied in the Bill. However, it is also crucial that there should be adequate professional representation on these panels, to ensure an ability to advise on specifically medical or optical issues. I hope that the Minister can clarify these important points.</p>

I am sorry that I did not speak before the noble Lord, Lord Walton, as I had hoped that he would also support my amendment. As we are on Report, this is the only time we will debate it; perhaps he can intervene before I sit down.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08062483000256"></a>I apologise; I had thought that it would be a long time before we reached these amendments. My Amendment No. 56 does not cut across the amendment of my noble friend Lord Howe at all. I strongly support having equal numbers of lay and professional people. My history of doing so goes back nearly 50 years, when I supported equal numbers on the Inner London Executive Council, which ran the National Health Service for London. I was a professional member, of whom there were too many. The numbers were not equal, and I did not think that that was a good or healthy thing. It is far better to have equal numbers, so I support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Howe.</p>

<a name="80624-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08062483000257"></a>My amendment is quite different. I would like to see retention of at least two elected professional members. The profession has ownership of its council if it can elect some of its own members. A fully appointed body is not as good. I have quoted various bodies that make appointments; professionals do not feel that they are in touch with that process at all. I therefore propose that at least two professional people should be elected by members of their own profession. In my experience on the General Dental Council&#151;sadly not comparable with the General Medical Council&#151;most of the original thoughts came from the elected  members. They were people in ordinary practice who seemed to know what was going on in the everyday life of their profession.</p>

I wish to speak to Amendment No. 54A, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. This amendment is linked to a question that I raised in Committee regarding American doctors practising in this country. I asked whether they would be covered by the rules under which they practised in the United States or whether they would be subject only to the jurisdiction and rules of the General Medical Council. Since then, I have received a letter from my noble friend Lady Thornton, for which I thank her. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="08062483000380"></a>&#147;I can confirm that American doctors who wish to practise in the UK must be registered with the General Medical Council. American doctors are therefore subject to the same statutory requirements, rules and regulations as all other doctors on the medical register&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000322"></a>I believe that this could cause a problem for American doctors practising here.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80624-0007.htm"/>


<a name="80624-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08062483000261"></a>As I pointed out in Committee, in most American states doctors have a mandatory duty to report suspected child abuse to the authorities and are protected from liability if they report in good faith. Our Government&#146;s guidance, <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, recognises the role of health professionals and paediatricians in stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="08062483000381"></a>&#147;They are uniquely placed to notice possible signs of abuse and it is essential that they follow up any concerns they have in line with locally established procedures. Their first duty is to the child whose safety and well-being is paramount&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000323"></a>Any reasonable person would consider that all this amounts to the same thing, but does it? Not according to the Minister&#146;s letter, for the GMC does not seem to recognise protection for paediatricians reporting in good faith. To be the voice of the child who has no voice can be a risky business, as paediatrician Dr David Southall found to his cost when he did just that and ended up fighting for his professional life.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08062483000262"></a>When paediatricians move a vote of no confidence in the GMC and a paper signed by 53 paediatricians complains that the GMC&#146;s action is contrary to child protection work, something should be done. The General Medical Council has to recognise that it needs to change its approach. Until that day, we must do what we can, however small. It would indeed be helpful&#151;the amendment calls for this&#151;to have a balance between lay and professionally qualified members on any fitness-to-practise panel. One hopes that they would have an understanding of and indeed might have met the problems and that they would be able to react correctly to the lower standards of child protection that the GMC seems to require. This amendment would go some way towards redressing the balance, as such knowledge and understanding on a panel are always helpful.</p>

He rightly highlighted the need to gain the confidence of the public and the profession as regards the new regulatory changes. There will be many changes and hiccups along the way, because that is the nature of changing regulation.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08062483000264"></a>If we do not ensure that there is a balance of members on panels, there is a real danger that decisions will be subject to appeal and that the credibility of the processes will be called into question. I am afraid that I do not share the Government&#146;s confidence that including this matter in guidance or in regulations for the healthcare profession will ensure that it will be dealt with. It depends how that guidance is written and on other things that are going on that day, including the number of people who cannot attend.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08062483000265"></a>I can see the sense behind the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes.

I have a reservation about this amendment, but perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify whether the noble Baroness has something important before us today.</p>

However fair or just the Government think that their rules or secondary regulations may be, they are seen to be behind the scenes. Therefore, it is terribly important to have a provision such as this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="08062483000267"></a><a name="80624-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80624-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062483000535"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 54A would require the same number of lay members and professionally qualified members on OHPA&#146;s fitness-to-practise panels on all occasions. This is an issue that I would expect OHPA to consider when drawing up its procedural rules. I hope that I can persuade noble Lords that we need to give OHPA the opportunity to consider the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches before it decides how to run its fitness-to-practise panels. Existing best practice is for panels to comprise three people, with the flexibility for more panellists to be added for more difficult and complex cases. The Bill, as drafted, mirrors these arrangements. My noble friend Lady Golding outlined one such difficult case. There are always odd numbers on such panels in order to allow a majority vote. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, helpfully pointed out in Grand Committee, lay magistrates almost always sit  in threes.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08062483000268"></a>This amendment would prevent a simple majority decision by the panel where there is a lay or professional chair. In order to have an equal number of lay and professional panellists, the panel would need to be increased to four people. With a panel of four people, there is obviously no inbuilt mechanism for a majority  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1369"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decision, so there is a genuine mathematical problem. OHPA might also consider that such a restriction on the composition of its panels does not reflect the role of panel members. Lay and professional members are there to listen to the evidence presented and to come to an impartial decision on the basis of this evidence. Having lay and professional members on the panels is not to ensure equal representation but to demonstrate that professional regulation is a partnership between professionals and the public.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08062483000269"></a>While I recognise that OHPA may well want to adopt the approach set out in this amendment, I urge the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to give OHPA the independence to make up its own mind. The Bill requires OHPA, in drawing up its procedural rules, to consult the regulators, the professions and CHRE. The rules are also subject to parliamentary scrutiny via the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08062483000270"></a>Amendment No. 56 would prevent the move to fully appointed councils of regulatory bodies and would impose a requirement for at least two council members to be elected from the registrants of the relevant regulatory body. It would also&#151;I am not sure that this is an intended effect&#151;delete the provision in the Bill that would enable councils that wish to do so to move to a lay majority via a Section 60 order. While this amendment would allow the majority of the council to be appointed with a minimum of two elected members, the Government feel strongly that the principle of elections among registrants for positions on the councils of their regulatory bodies is wrong. Therefore, I regret that I cannot support this amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08062483000271"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree that, if the people who are being regulated elect the people responsible for regulating them, this potentially creates a perception that they are there to do the bidding of their electors because they are representatives. As I said in Grand Committee, professional members on a regulatory body should not be representatives of the practitioners who have elected them. Elections create a situation where patients and the public are entitled to question whether the professional member, elected by his peers, sees his first duty to those who elected him or to the patients whom the regulatory body exists to protect. I state clearly for the record that the move to appointments is in no way intended to diminish the role of professional members on councils. Instead, it will add more weight to the professional perspective, as appointed professional members will be free from any doubt that their views are coloured by a responsibility to represent the interests of their electorate.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08062483000272"></a>Through the creation of a system of independent appointments by the Appointments Commission, the public and the professions can be assured that people are being appointed because of their abilities, their successful track record of achievement and their commitment to patient safety. The registrants who have these qualities and this experience will be able to apply for appointment through a transparent process and be assessed against competences developed by the commission alongside the regulators.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08062483000273"></a>Finally, I emphasise that none of the regulatory bodies is asking to keep its elected members. They have accepted the principle of moving to fully appointed

On that basis, and in light of my explanations, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, will feel able not to press her amendment.</p>

The Minister pointed out that my amendment is defective in that, if it were accepted, it would lead to an even number of people on the panels. That was not my intention; I am fully signed up to the proposition that there should be an uneven number, for precisely the reasons that she gave. I had thought that the sense of the amendment would have been obvious, as it was to those noble Lords who supported me.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08062483000275"></a>The central point here is public confidence; the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, was right to bring that out. Having said that, I take the Minister&#146;s point that this matter will be the subject of considerable public consultation. I was also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walton, for posing the question about how the rules, when established, would be approved and by whom. It is reassuring to hear that there will be parliamentary scrutiny. I do not belittle the type of parliamentary scrutiny that comes with the negative resolution procedure but, to be negative about the negative resolution procedure, we are all aware that in practice it is not possible for us to change a statutory instrument or to vote it down. We can only look forward to a statutory instrument that is the product of considered prior deliberation by the OHPA and those whom it consults. It is right for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08062483000279"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment relates to Schedule 8 to the Bill. Paragraph 1 of the schedule would bring the pharmacy profession in Northern Ireland within the scope of Section 60 of the Health Act 1999. That section provides for a power to make Orders in Council modifying the regulation of various medical professions covered by other legislation set out in Section 60(2).</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1371"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08062483000280"></a>Section 62(10) of the 1999 Act provides that if a provision of such an Order in Council&#151;that is, an Order in Council under Section 60&#151;is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, the draft order must be laid before and approved by the Scottish Parliament. In Northern Ireland, the regulation of health and associated professions is fully devolved. The Northern Ireland Assembly has legislative competence over all the matters mentioned in Section 60(2) of the 1999 Act. However, there is no equivalent of Section 62(10) for the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08062483000281"></a>That brings me to the main point of my amendment, which is to insert a new subsection (10A) into the 1990 Act. That would make exactly the same provision for the Northern Ireland Assembly as Section 62(10) makes for the Scottish Parliament so that, if a Section 60 order contains provisions that would be within the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a draft of that order must be laid before and approved by the Assembly. This is an important procedural point because it relates to the relationship between this Parliament and the devolved legislatures. It would achieve parity between the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly and it would apply good practice and good relations between Parliament and the devolved legislatures.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08062483000282"></a>The process is analogous to the Sewel procedure, whereby a consent motion is sought in the devolved legislature when Parliament is legislating on a devolved matter. The Sewel procedure has been put on a statutory basis for Scotland and I am proposing the same for Northern Ireland. My amendment would put the Assembly on the same standing as the Scottish Parliament where the regulation of the profession is devolved. That is the important point. If the regulation of the profession is devolved and Westminster is giving a power to modify that regulation, before that power is exercised there should be effective consultation with the devolved legislature.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08062483000283"></a>The matter was drawn to my attention by the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. I cannot avoid the temptation to note that the initials of that body are PSNI. This PSNI was created in 1924, or thereabouts, and I can only assume that it was not drawn to the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, when he decided to use exactly the same initials to describe the police force in Northern Ireland. Some people take great pride in using PSNI to refer to the Pharmaceutical Society rather than the Police Service, but that is by the way.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08062483000284"></a>The Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland noted that the power in Schedule 8 intended to bring it within the Section 60 order power. It made representations to the health department and the amendment derives from those discussions. I think that the amendment was drafted by the society and has been considered by the Northern Ireland department. The first part of the amendment clarifies Section 62(10) and repeats what is in paragraph 2 of Schedule 8. I am not sure whether in this draft that clarification would also apply to the proposed new subsection (10). As the draft fell into my hands from discussions between the society and the department, I decided not to presume to change the wording, as that might have led to greater confusion.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08062483000285"></a>I expected the draft to emerge as a government amendment consequent on a request from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland to the Department of Health in Whitehall. I understood that it would appear at an earlier stage, but it seems that the department has had second thoughts about the amendment. I think, judging from what I have heard of the discussions between the society and the department as late as last Friday, that it may still be undecided.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08062483000286"></a>I thought it right to table the amendment because it relates not so much to the detail of regulation as to devolution and the principle of devolution. I am strengthened by a letter that I received from Dr Brian Patterson, the chairman of the Northern Ireland Council of the British Medical Association. I shall, if I may, read the guts of the letter to your Lordships. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="08062483000387"></a>&#147;It has come to my attention that you have tabled an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill, currently going through the House of Lords committee stage.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="08062483000388"></a>&#147;The BMA(NI) welcomes the inclusion of this amendment as it will help ensure that any Order in Council under the Health Act 1999 affecting Northern Ireland will be &#145;devolution-proofed&#146; first to counteract any possible democratic deficit.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="08062483000389"></a>&#147;The amendment brings Northern Ireland into line with the status of Scotland. This seems eminently sensible, given that medical regulation is a fully devolved issue to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="08062483000390"></a>&#147;This would allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to scrutinise any proposal before it becomes an Order in Council to ensure it will be sensitive to local needs while maintaining a UK wide approach on appropriate health policies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062483000324"></a>That is an eminently reasonable position to take.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08062483000287"></a>Parenthetically, I add that it is the preference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland that its profession be subject to a local regulatory scheme, similar to the local schemes for the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Social Care Council. Such an arrangement could still be put in place by the devolved institutions if the Whitehall department does not use the power under Section 60 as amended by the Bill. In theory, the local option could survive without this amendment, but the existence of this extension of the Section 60 power in the Bill could be read as an intention to override localism.</p>

<a name="80624-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08062483000288"></a>I emphasise again that this matter is brought forward as a matter of principle concerning devolution. It is not wise to devolve a matter and then a short time later to take a power to override devolution by an Order in Council. It is also not wise to treat the devolved legislatures of Northern Ireland and Scotland differently. I beg to move.</p>

They all found that entertaining and that was why they took the exam. We do not want to go back to the days when we could not rely on regulation being regulation wherever we were in the United Kingdom. It is terribly important that members of the public can be sure that health professionals are regulated to the same high standard wherever they are in the United Kingdom. For health professionals themselves, it enables easier movement. It means that they are more able to move from area to area within the UK and  not fear that they are going to be regulated in a different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08062483000291"></a>If Northern Ireland feels that this should be a devolved issue, in my experience in the other place and here, the representatives from Northern Ireland are more than adequate and more than able to represent the views of people in Northern Ireland.

However, on this occasion I hope he will forgive me if I sound a dissenting note. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, I feel firmly that one area of policy that we really should not attempt to subject to devolution is the regulation of healthcare professionals. My noble friend may say that he does not propose devolution in the full sense, but the amendment would provide for decision-making in this area to be vested not only in Westminster but in the Northern Ireland Assembly. That would open up the potential for a different regulatory scheme to apply in the Province from that which applies on the UK mainland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08062483000294"></a>The central issue is that we need absolute confidence that the system of regulation that is applied across the United Kingdom is uniform, so that, as the noble Baroness said, members of the public can be sure that, wherever they are, the healthcare professionals who look after them are regulated to the same high standard. They should be able to know that no country in the UK has a regulatory system that is weaker or worse resourced than any other. I do not necessarily wish to imply that the Northern Ireland Assembly would want a weaker or worse resourced system of regulation, but we should not open up the potential for that.</p>

We should not facilitate a situation in which extra regulatory hurdles could spring up in one part of the UK that acted as obstacles to taking up a job in that part of the country.

Scotland already has the provision under that legislation to approve orders that contain devolved matters. Health professional regulation is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland and Scotland; it is fully devolved to Northern Ireland and partly devolved to Scotland. I recognise the importance of involving the devolved Administrations in decisions on regulation to ensure that they take account of the differing needs of the four countries. However, they also work towards UK-wide solutions to statutory professional regulation, so that, although there are differences, they work hard.</p>

However, if noble Lords do not like the idea of having these matters devolved, they need to revisit the primary legislation, which, as I said at the outset, completely devolves all these matters to the Northern Ireland Assembly and partly devolves them to the Scottish Parliament. The starting point of this, and of my observations, is that these are devolved matters.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08062483000300"></a>If a uniform scheme arises on a non-devolved matter, it should be done with proper consultation, rather than through the exercise of a statutory override. The Minister may not regard it in those terms because a degree of consultation tends, as a matter of routine, to take place between the departments, but Section 60 of the 1999 Act gives the Whitehall department the power to override the Northern Ireland Assembly, but not to override the Scottish Parliament. That anomaly needs to be addressed one way or the other. I am arguing for assimilating Northern Ireland to the position of the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps other noble Lords would want to remove the right that the Scottish Parliament has in legislation to be consulted. It is important to have consultation because particular circumstances may need to be taken into account. With regard to the pharmacy profession, a particular circumstance that needs to be taken into account is the existence of the land frontier and the fact that under European legislation there will be a considerable interchange between practitioners either side of that border.</p>

I have a very high regard for the Northern Ireland Minister and regard him as a very good friend, but I deliberately did not speak to him on this matter so that I would not come between him and his department. That is for him to sort out. My information was accurate only up to discussions as of Friday afternoon; the Minister claims that she is accurate up to the moment. We will see where we are when we come back at Third Reading. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080624107000004"></a>Initially, I had great reservations about the change from the criminal to the civil burden of proof. I have had many discussions with the General Medical Council. I completely accept that the way in which this is working out seems fine, but the reservations about the future have not gone away. The BMA and the defence unions have expressed concerns that the civil burden of proof in the long term may not be the whole answer. Case law has dictated that the criminal burden, not a civil burden, of proof is used in disciplinary proceedings involving lawyers. In 2003, the House of Lords deemed that magistrates should avoid using the civil standard and should apply the criminal standard.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080624107000005"></a>The General Medical Council had a series of sanctions previously and these have been transposed into their new proceedings. One of the most important sanctions is the retraining of a doctor in areas of low competence where there is a departure from the standards laid out by the General Medical Council. The standards are designed to protect patients and not in any way to protect doctors. These protective standards were applied previously and are being applied in the hearings using the civil burden of proof. The concern of the defence unions is whether, over time, all the decisions will be deemed to be fair and consistent as the civil burden is applied flexibly and over an increasingly broad range of problems. Everyone must sincerely hope that they will be and that the system will be fair.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080624107000006"></a>In the light of problems and experience, however, there may be a need for a clear definition at the top end of the scale of flexibility and some cases may require the criminal burden of proof to be used. Changes may need to be implemented. My concern is that the Bill as drafted locks the regulators into a civil burden of proof. In her response to me in Committee, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="080624107000168"></a>&#147;We think that changing to the civil standard is the right thing to do. It is a recommendation of the Shipman inquiry, and many regulators are already using it. We want to ensure consistency, not just now but in future, so that all health and social care regulators use that standard&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/08; col. GC 537.]</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080624107000007"></a>I was concerned that the Minister was unable to say that we have the evidence that this is the right thing to do and that we are right to exclude the criminal burden of proof.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080624107000008"></a>The amendment is drafted to enable us to leave that door open. We must ensure that there is a clear message in the Bill that, although the civil standard of proof will continue, as is already happening, in the event of a problem arising we will not have to go back through a legislative process and wait. If particular difficulties arise, they can be addressed by reverting to the criminal burden of proof in exceptional circumstances. The amendment is simply a broad safety net, providing alternative wording to avoid locking us into to a civil burden of proof. I beg to move.</p>

I confess that my experience, going back many years to chairing panels under the old General Medical Council arrangements, was that the criminal standard of proof was properly and sensibly applied in leading to sanctions that might affect a doctor&#146;s registration.   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1377"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, I appreciate the reasons why, in her thoughtful report after the Shipman inquiry, Dame Janet Smith made the powerful suggestion that that criminal burden of proof set too high a standard for sanctions to be employed against a doctor who had been guilty of some failing in his or her practice.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080624107000010"></a>The issue is not simply malpractice or criminal behaviour. The new panels also cover issues relating to the doctor&#146;s fitness to practise on the grounds of professional standards or competence, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, implied. Sanctions can be applied by the body to require a doctor to undergo a period of retraining, for example, if it is shown that his or her standard of practice is less than adequate.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080624107000011"></a>Issues also arise in relation to a doctor who may be suffering some form of ill health, which may impair his or her standard of practice. In those cases, a civil standard of proof is perfectly adequate. I am still concerned that in some cases of alleged malpractice the use of the civil standard, even if applied flexibly, as the General Medical Council has now suggested, means that there is a serious risk that injustices may occur. This amendment cleverly leaves open the possibility for the criminal standard to be applied if the practice of OHPA demonstrates that there are cases where the application and use of the civil standard is endangering doctors&#146; livelihoods at a level that appears to suggest the possibility of serious injustice.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080624107000012"></a>The GMC has been applying the civil standard flexibly and will do so until OHPA is fully established and working. I fully appreciate that other regulatory authorities&#151;in nursing, midwifery, dentistry and other professions&#151;are now using the civil standard of proof. However, reservations about its use continue to trouble me and for that reason I support the amendment.</p>

I expressed my concerns at Second Reading, when I said that I was prepared to be persuaded. However, I continue to share the view of my noble friends that this may be unsatisfactory in some cases. In English law, one is innocent until proved guilty. The use of probability is easily misconstrued and I think that it could lead to a wrong decision, although time will tell. I will certainly support the amendment.</p>

At Second Reading I supported the idea of the civil standard of proof, based on my more recent experiences of the GMC&#146;s disciplinary committee and particularly its interim orders committee, in which any minor deviance on the part of the doctor was tested on the criminal standard of proof&#151;at least, that was how it felt to me. The civil standard of proof, applied flexibly, is what the doctor will be tested on. I clearly now understand why the GMC has moved to that civil standard of proof, flexibly applied. It should deal with all cases, no matter what the severity of the alleged offence. On that basis I do not support the amendment. We will have to wait and see how the civil standard works.</p>

A lot of people said that, if found guilty, a doctor would lose his livelihood, so it was important to keep the criminal standard of proof to make that less likely to happen. We cannot judge doctors by different standards from the rest of the population&#151;that is a ridiculous notion. Everyone&#146;s profession, job or place of work is important to them, and it is not only doctors whom we must consider when dealing with such legal matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080624107000018"></a>The other reason why it is important to endorse the enshrining of the civil burden of proof in the Bill is that that enables previous episodes of complaints against the doctor of carelessness&#151;not necessarily malpractice&#151;to be taken into account when considering the case. That cannot be done under the criminal burden of proof. When we are talking about healthcare and care of individuals&#151;the general public&#151;it is terribly important to take that into account. A series of events, not necessarily just one event, might mean that someone should lose their entitlement to practise. I regret that I have to oppose the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. I almost always support her but on this occasion I feel that I cannot.</p>

Amendments Nos. 56A and 59A offer a different approach in setting out that the standard of proof may, rather than will, be the standard

In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, had some concerns about whether it was right to use the civil standard of proof in all cases, but particularly questioned the need for it to be included in the Bill given that the GMC was already moving to the civil standard without the need for primary legislation. It is on this basis that I think that she has tabled Amendments Nos. 56B and 59B. I hope that I will be able to convince her that the clauses are important to the future of professional regulation and should indeed be included in the Bill. I hate to disagree with her&#151;and indeed with the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, and the noble Lord, Lord Walton, for whom I have the greatest respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080624107000021"></a>Since the NHS Plan was published in 2000, there has been a long debate with the professional regulators about the introduction of the civil standard, with influential figures such as Lady Justice Smith coming down firmly in favour of it in light of the evidence that she looked at as part of the Shipman inquiry. As I put on record in Committee, I firmly believe that the use of the civil standard of proof in fitness-to-practise procedures will ensure a balance between fairness to the accused practitioner and the protection of the public. Using the civil standard of proof wholly reflects the nature of fitness-to-practise hearings. I remind your Lordships that the panels conducting hearings into fitness to practise do not in any way constitute a criminal court and will not apply criminal law. Instead, these are civil proceedings, which are best matched with the civil standard of proof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080624107000022"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that the argument is given powerful weight by the evidence from other sectors. The civil standard of proof is used by the police, solicitors, architects and vets. Of course, it is already successfully used by eight of the 11 professional regulatory bodies. While I acknowledge that primary legislation is not needed to allow the professional regulators to move to the civil standard of proof, it is needed to require them to use it. Put simply, the Government believe that the civil standard is right, so we want to make sure that all professional regulatory bodies use it not just now but in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080624107000023"></a>To allow regulators to pick and choose which standard they apply would run counter to the important arguments for the civil standard of proof that I have just set out and might perpetuate inconsistency across the different regulators, which would of course lead to confusion for patients and professionals about which standard would apply. For example, a complaint might involve professionals covered by different regulators and it would be unfair if they had their cases heard to different standards of proof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080624107000024"></a>While the GMC has decided independently to move to the civil standard of proof, other professional regulators have not.

Without the legislation, there would be no way of ensuring a consistent standard of proof across the board. That explains the

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080624107000025"></a>There are two possible legal interpretations of the amendments. First, they could have the effect that there was no statutory requirement for regulators to use the civil standard of proof but would allow them the freedom to move to the civil standard in their procedural rules. The Bill would therefore not change the current position. I have already set out in detail why the Government believe that we should not leave the position as it is, so I will not take up time by reiterating that, if noble Lords will forgive me. The amendments could alternatively have the legal effect of requiring panels to decide at the outset of every hearing whether they should use the civil or criminal standard in that particular case. It is unclear how the panel would make such a decision.</p>

<a name="80624-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080624107000026"></a>We do not consider it helpful to leave that crucial issue to the panel to decide. It will prolong cases while there is legal argument and the arbitrary nature of the decision could lead to a high number of appeals. In any case, the civil standard is applied flexibly. That means that, in the most serious cases, in its application and outcome it will be indistinguishable from the criminal standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080624107000032"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we debated this amendment on 21 May. It is set out in detail in col. GC539 of <I>Hansard</I> of that date. I presented many reasons and comments and do not intend to repeat them, because time is valuable. Anyone who followed the debate or would like to know more can look those up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080624107000033"></a>In her very helpful reply, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="080624107000175"></a>&#147;The noble Baroness made a powerful case. I would like to reassure her that, should the view of the General Dental Council on this point change in the future, the Government would consider making such a change through an order under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999. We do not consider that primary legislation would be required&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/08; col. GC544.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000159"></a>She goes on to say that the Government already have the flexibility to do this through secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080624107000034"></a>Since then, I have seen a letter written by the president of the General Dental Council, dated 12 June. It is quite unbelievable that it should be so contrary to what the Minister has said. The letter was sent to someone who was strongly supporting my case. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="080624107000176"></a>&#147;I certainly agree with you that retired or non-practising dentists can still offer a great deal to the profession and the public at large. I don&#146;t think anyone would dispute that. I do not believe however that for most of these activities registration with the GDC is required. In principle, many members of the Council are entirely sympathetic to the concept of some sort of retired list ... The Council, however, is not convinced that a list of retired, i.e. non-practising dentists, is in the public interest. I have no doubt whatsoever that this matter will be discussed again and while I think it is unlikely it will be done in the lifetime of this Council I have no doubt that it will be on the agenda of our successor&#146;s and I think that is certainly sensible since&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000160"></a>this is the bit that impressed me&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080624107000203"></a>&#147;there is no immediate prospect of a legislative opportunity being available&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000161"></a>He goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a><a name="080624107000177"></a>&#147;It is widely recognised that there is a significant queue of legislation for healthcare regulators to be passed through Parliament&#146;s lawyers and in turn Parliament and, in some cases, the Scottish Parliament, over the next two years and&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000162"></a>again, I stress this&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080624107000204"></a>&#147;therefore there is absolutely no prospect of early legislation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000163"></a>He finishes by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="080624107000178"></a>&#147;The time to have a discussion is when the window of opportunity is possible. I am sorry I can only give you sympathy and cannot do anything practical to advance this in the meantime&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624107000164"></a>To me, that is unbelievable. Here we have an opportunity&#151;that is why I have tabled this amendment&#151;and the General Dental Council is saying it cannot possibly do it. For years, it has hidden behind the cloak of not being able to do it because doctors have the legal power and dentists do not. As I said in my previous moving of this amendment, doctors and solicitors remain on the register when they have retired honourably. The only people who are not on the

Why are dentists second-class citizens? Why should they be different from all other healthcare professionals?</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="080624107000035"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, commented on how important it was that all healthcare professionals should be treated in the same way. That is absolutely true. At the moment, if someone wants to cease practice through illness, maternity leave or any other reason, they are removed from the register. To me, that is extraordinary. I do not accept that it is not in the public interest to retain retired dentists&#146; names on the register. I do not mind in what way it is done: it could be on a separate list, or as part of the same list. The essential point about any of these registers, whether for doctors or dentists, is whether they have an annual practising certificate. If you have a practising certificate, you can practise. If you do not have a practising certificate, you cannot practise. Surely that is a clear enough distinction. I do not see why anything more is required.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080624107000036"></a>Why would dentists be treated as second-class citizens, which is what is being done in this case? As I mentioned at the last hearing, an extraordinary number of posts and positions are filled by dentists who have to remain on the register, even though they are not practising. They have to pay the full &#163;400 registration fee and do all this continuing professional development, even though they are not going to touch a patient. They are in teaching or lecturing professions, or writing journals, or doing all sorts of other things, but they still have to be on the register. Yet they do not really require practising certificates because they are not practising.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="080624107000037"></a>It is very important that dentists should not be treated differently from other healthcare professionals. I think that there is value in that. Some dentists wrote to me this week to say that another good reason for retaining on registers doctors, dentists and all sorts of other people is that, if there was any sort of national emergency, you would immediately have a list of people to go to who, although they may not be currently practising, would have knowledge that might be useful in those circumstances. There are many reasons in the public interest why this should be the case. I thank the Minister for making clear in the past that it would be very simple for the Government to do it. Whereas in the past I believed that it would be possible and did not need to be put aside, when I now see that letter, which states that there is no opportunity to legislate, I cannot allow this opportunity to pass. It is very important that we seriously consider adding this to the Bill to avoid the suggestion of so many years of waiting before any possibility of legislation. My amendment was only intended to be enabling legislation, not to force the General Dental Council to do this, but I really worry when I see the council&#146;s attitude. I beg to move.</p>

The situation for doctors has very much changed and all of us in that position will be invited in August this year to decide whether we wish to stay on the register, even if we are no longer practising. There have been occasions, even in your Lordships&#146; House, when I have been required quite informally to give medical support and advice when a crisis has arisen. The question is: do I require still to be on the register to do that? I will have to consider whether to stay on the register and pay the fee, or take voluntary erasure. The GMC is now recommending that next year, it will try to introduce a list of people who are registered but retired, and with no licence to practise. It is a complicated matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080624107000043"></a>The noble Baroness tabled an identical amendment in Committee and we listened with interest to her concerns then and again today. Amendment No. 56C would amend the Dentists Act 1984 to allow retired dentists to remain on the dentists register on the payment of a reduced fee. It also makes provision for such dentists to be restored to the register on payment of a fee if the reason for their erasure was non-payment of that fee.</p>

Obviously, timescales would have to be considered if  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1384"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the General Dental Council approached this. I would be very happy to write to the noble Baroness in detail if she would find such a letter useful. She could then clarify the position with her colleagues at the General Dental Council.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080624107000045"></a>I emphasise again that I recognise that removal from the register signifies a great deal more to a dentist than the fact that they no longer practise. The House is grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s expertise and for bringing these concerns to the Chamber. The General Dental Council&#146;s position is that the dentists register exists to serve and protect the public rather than the profession. Its current position is that no public benefit has been identified in maintaining a list of inactive former dentists and therefore the General Dental Council does not support this amendment. I feel sympathy for the two distinguished dentists in the Chamber whose proud record in serving their profession for years would not be recognised.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="080624107000046"></a>I should also mention that the White Paper on working groups on revalidation for all professionals will need to consider the wider issues around semi-retirement, retirement, career breaks and the ability of professionals to make use of or provide expert opinion to others. Until these groups have concluded their deliberations, it would not be appropriate to make the change proposed by the amendment. However, the implementation of any recommendations from these groups will be discussed with all the regulatory bodies, including the General Dental Council. I hope that that provides another option for the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080624107000047"></a>In conclusion, it is the Government&#146;s view that should the General Dental Council decide, in the light of the revalidation working groups, that it wishes to change its position, it may well find that it is pushing at an open door. As the changes proposed in the amendment could be made through existing secondary legislation, and in the light of the General Dental Council&#146;s current position, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, was not in Grand Committee on 21 May when I quoted from <I>GMCtoday</I>, I think that I must repeat that part on the position of doctors. I said then that the article states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="080624107000179"></a>&#147;In future, there will be three options. You may hold registration plus a licence to practise. You may decide to hold registration only, or you may take voluntary erasure from the register&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="080624107000180"></a>&#147;Why would a doctor want to hold registration only?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080624107000166"></a>The answer, the article states, is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a><a name="080624107000181"></a>&#147;When the concept of revalidation was first introduced back in 1998, a significant number of doctors who are not in active practice expressed concern that they would lose their connection with the GMC. They saw their GMC registration as part of their professional identity. We will therefore make it possible for them to maintain their connection with the GMC by continuing to hold GMC registration, but without a licence. There will be a cost for this, although it will be less than the cost of holding a licence plus registration. However, doctors with registration only will not be able to practise. Of course, doctors who see no advantage in holding registration only will be able take voluntary erasure from the register. This will cost them nothing&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/08, col. GC 541.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080624107000049"></a>The dental situation was changed in 2004 and instead of paying &#163;65, dentists over a certain age had to pay either the sum of almost &#163;400 or nothing. There was no alternative. Doctors have been exempt from all charge but now it is suggested that there will be a charge. But this article contains no suggestion that they will not have the right to continue if they pay a certain charge. Dentists would certainly have been happy to pay about &#163;100 a year, instead of &#163;400. They would not have kept up the continuing professional development that is required. But at that time the General Dental Council threw away 2,500 dentists, losing a nice little income of &#163;250,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080624107000050"></a>The debate on this issue has made it clear to me that, although I am happy to withdraw the amendment now, I shall bring it back again at the next stage, not just for dentists but for doctors, social workers and all healthcare professionals. It would be very progressive if we put in the Bill an enabling provision, although it would not in any way force the General Dental Council to do this. If the dentists decide that they do not want it, that will be up to the General Dental Council. But the points that have been made by social workers and by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, today show that things are changing and that there should be an enabling provision in the Bill. This would be in the public interest; it would be valuable to have a list of people available in case of a national emergency or any other situation.</p>

Currently no service is funded to do this. Making a complaint about a doctor is a big step and a daunting task to all but the most feisty and determined among us. Many patients, because of age or infirmity, are in no way feisty, nor, often, are they able to draw on the emotional reserves necessary to enable them to stand up for what they believe is right, simply because that requires effort and courage.

They need someone, at least at the outset, who can talk them through the process in a completely objective and unintimidating way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080624107000056"></a>The other aspect of the problem is the opposite situation. There are many complaints made to the GMC every year which are a complete waste of time. Many of them are not the concern of the GMC at all and would be more appropriately dealt with by other bodies. The result is that the GMC is landed with a huge amount of unnecessary work in assessing and redirecting complaints of this sort. It would be much better if there were somewhere people could turn to for advice before launching into a complaint that otherwise might be wholly misdirected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080624107000057"></a>The need for advice and assistance was highlighted by the Shipman inquiry. There is now quite a widespread feeling that this need should somehow be met. The amendment would make it a duty of the CHRE to commission independent advice and information services to assist members of the public who have concerns about the fitness to practise of a health professional: first, to enable them to decide whether to report that concern to a regulatory body; and, secondly, if they decide to do so, to assist them in that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="080624107000058"></a>The CHRE sent me a note voicing concern that the proposal contained in the amendment might compromise its independence. I do not see why that should be, if we are talking about the CHRE commissioning a service, which it then oversees, and which is largely devoted to giving advice on process. In another place the Minister was broadly sympathetic to the aim of a very similar amendment but said that it was not necessary because the CHRE already had powers to provide a service of broadly this kind. That was encouraging, but the trouble is that, without appropriate funding, the CHRE will find it impossible to implement such a service. It would be very helpful if the Minister could provide some more concrete reassurance today about this idea and tell us whether and to what extent the Government&#146;s thinking has developed on these matters. I beg to move.</p>

For example, the General Medical Council has published <I>A Patient&#146;s Guide</I>&#151;<I>How You Can Refer a Doctor to the GMC</I> and the General Chiropractic Council published <I>How to Complain About a Chiropractor: Telling the General Chiropractic Council About Your Concerns.</I> These publications tell the public about the role of the organisation, what information they will need to provide about a complaint, the process followed after a complaint is made and what the outcomes might be. All the healthcare profession regulators publish similar information for members of the public and patients. Support for patients, complainants and witnesses is not limited to leaflets. The regulators provide telephone advice on making complaints and on whether the matter might be better dealt with locally than by a national regulator. They also provide detailed information and advice to members of the public who appear as witnesses in a fitness-to-practise case, such as the layout of the hearing room and an explanation of the hearing process.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080624107000062"></a>The Government are confident that the GMC and GOC will continue to provide the necessary information and support to witnesses OHPA&#146;s hearings. In addition, the Bill requires the OHPA to ensure that the  public are informed about its functions, as provided in Clause 102.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080624107000063"></a>While we think that the regulators should provide this detailed advice, I can assure noble Lords that it is very much the role of the CHRE to consider whether the information and advice that regulators provide is satisfactory from the patient&#146;s perspective. If it is not, the CHRE can raise this issue in its report to Parliament on the performance of the regulator, which is a clear mechanism for triggering any specific improvements needed. The Government are still looking at local complaints resolution, and I hope to be able to say more about complaints at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80624-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080624107000064"></a>The CHRE already provides on its website information about other organisations that can provide support to patients. On this basis and in the light of my explanations and the fact that we will be looking again at local complaints resolution, I hope that the noble Earl will be able to withdraw this amendment.</p>

The House may like to know that I was prompted to table the amendment by Action for Victims of Medical Accidents (AvMA), which has a natural interest in this area. I totally accept that the main role of the CHRE is to oversee the performance of the regulatory process. I would not dissent from that for a moment. It is true that the CHRE has been clear that this amendment is a departure from its current role. My puzzlement, however, stemmed from the fact that the Minister in another place said that the CHRE already had the power to provide the service I was talking about, which rather suggests that it is not such a major departure from their current role. However, much of what the Minister said is very reassuring, and I and others will look forward to anything she is able to tell

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080624107000073"></a>On Amendment No. 59, we had an extremely useful debate in Grand Committee about the power in the Bill to allow healthcare organisations to share information with healthcare workers. Noble Lords focused particularly on sharing information which may be unsubstantiated at the time of sharing and where information may show a threat to a patient&#146;s safety. In Grand Committee there was some recognition that it could sometimes be justified to share information that suggests, but may not in itself be sufficient to prove, a possible threat to patients&#146; safety. An example we discussed was an extreme value on a clinical indicator. I was pleased about the degree of consensus on this point but I also took away from the debate some important points made by noble Lords about getting the balance right between protecting patients and ensuring the fair treatment of practitioners.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080624107000074"></a>I have therefore looked at how we might reassure noble Lords that the careers of healthcare workers will not be prejudiced by sharing information that includes unsubstantiated allegations. That is why I have tabled government Amendment No. 59, which requires the appropriate Minister, in making regulations that will set out in detail how information can and should be shared, to have regard to the importance of avoiding unfair prejudice to healthcare workers against whom unsubstantiated allegations are made. This means that the rights of healthcare workers will have to be taken fully into account when making the regulations which will, after all, determine how this provision works in practice. I hope noble Lords will welcome this.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080624107000075"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 75 and 76, during our debate in Grand Committee on the piloting of legally qualified chairs, concerns were raised about how such a pilot could be run in a way which would be fair to the individual practitioner. In response to these concerns, I gave an assurance that the Government were satisfied that there are a number of ways in which a pilot could be run fairly and sensibly. While not   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1389"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wishing to rehearse the important and detailed debate we had in Grand Committee, I am happy to repeat that assurance today. Having said that, I looked at the points that noble Lords raised and I appreciate that, notwithstanding my assurances, it may be difficult for them to be fully at ease with these provisions without seeing the detail of the proposals.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080624107000076"></a>In order to address these concerns, I did not want to remove the option of piloting from the Bill, as doing so would be removing a valuable optional mechanism for OHPA to use to help it to make evidence-based decisions on which cases might benefit from having legally qualified chairs. Instead, I have tabled a government amendment to ensure that, if OHPA decides to make rules which include piloting provisions, they must be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This means that your Lordships&#146; House will have the opportunity to debate the detail of how OHPA would like to run the pilot and will have the freedom to reject the proposals if there are any concerns that they are unfair to individual practitioners. This amendment means that noble Lords do not simply have to take my word for it that a pilot would be fair; they will be able to judge for themselves on the basis of firm proposals that OHPA itself will develop in conjunction with lawyers. I hope this will help to allay any remaining concerns on the issue. I beg to move.</p>

I do not expect the Minister to answer now, but on Amendment No. 59, will she write to me to explain the parallel situation facing social care workers? Under, for example, the protection of vulnerable adults legislation and the Protection of Children Act, the bar beyond which allegations can be made against social care workers is set considerably lower than it is for healthcare workers. I am concerned that there will be a disparity as regulation of the two professions moves together. Can the department furnish noble Lords with a digest that sets out in parallel the situation if one person is a medic and the other a social care worker? It would be extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080624107000087"></a>I turn first to Amendments Nos. 62, 64, 65 and 68. I recognise that there were concerns about whether the safeguards in the Bill were strong enough in relation to the powers to detain, isolate or quarantine individuals where they refuse to take action to protect others voluntarily. While I did feel that the Bill as drafted contained sufficient safeguards, I have looked carefully at how I might be able to provide additional reassurances to noble Lords. I have tabled three government amendments to introduce further safeguards around time limits for orders and extensions of orders. These amendments, first, restrict the periods of any detention, isolation or quarantine measure under the domestic regulation-making power to maximum periods of 28 days before a review must take place. This then mirrors the arrangements already in the Bill for the justice of the peace powers. Secondly, they restrict the period of any extension of a justice of the peace order to no more than 28 days at a time. Thirdly, they make the first version of regulations dealing with time periods for orders and extensions of orders other than for detention, isolation and quarantine subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so that Parliament can debate those provisions.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080624107000088"></a>I should now like to take the opportunity to make a further two commitments on the record for safeguards which will be included in the regulations. These additional safeguards are designed to ensure that there is transparency about how these orders are used, and that even the most vulnerable person who has an order made against him will be able to get any help and support he needs.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080624107000089"></a>Noble Lords have convincingly argued that it would be beneficial to have a central record kept of all orders made by justices of the peace. As I said in Grand Committee, the Department of Health has already agreed with the Health Protection Agency that it will set up a monitoring system for England within its standard operating procedures. I can now make a commitment that the regulations will require the local authority to report the making of an order to the HPA, in line with its existing duty to co-operate with the HPA, as set out in Section 5 of the Health Protection Agency Act 2004. I should also point out that guidance will be produced to accompany the legislation and assist relevant stakeholders in understanding their powers, duties and responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080624107000090"></a>Noble Lords were also concerned about the needs of vulnerable individuals who may be placed under an order. To enhance the existing safeguards, I am also

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080624107000091"></a>I turn now to government Amendments Nos. 60, 63, 66 and 67. Noble Lords raised some very important points in Grand Committee about the provisions allowing a justice of the peace to order the disposal of dead bodies where this is necessary to protect public health. Having carefully considered the views expressed in Grand Committee, I do not think that the Bill as drafted was as clear as it could be about what is intended by these provisions. Let me clarify this now. A dead body is either cremated or buried. In some cases it may be necessary to specify one method over the other, or to specify the manner in which burial or cremation should take place. For example, if a body was heavily contaminated with radioactive material and could not be safely cremated, it might need to be buried in an appropriately designed coffin so that the radioactive material was sufficiently contained. I have therefore tabled government Amendments Nos. 60 and 63 to make clear in primary legislation our intention that destruction or disposal of a dead body should only be by cremation or burial.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080624107000092"></a>Disposal of dead bodies is a sensitive issue. I agreed fully with the concerns raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about the distress that this may cause relatives and the need to make sure that they are both informed and have a right to challenge such an order. I have therefore tabled government Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 to require the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to make regulations setting out who is to be notified when a local authority applies for a justice of the peace order. It is my intention that these regulations will require local authorities to endeavour to notify the next of kin where an order involves a dead body. I also intend explicitly to add in regulations &#147;next of kin&#148; to the list of affected people who can make an application. This will ensure that the ambiguity surrounding the issue of ownership of a dead body does not prevent relatives applying to vary or revoke an order in relation to the deceased.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080624107000093"></a>I hope that noble Lords will feel that I have brought forward a substantial package of measures to address the concerns raised in Grand Committee and that I have provided adequate reassurance on a number of important points. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080624107000096"></a>The Government&#146;s amendment would limit the provision for automatic review to only those regulations which impose a special restriction or requirement on a person for longer than a specified period. This is narrower than the current language in the Bill which provides for all special restrictions or requirements, including in relation to things or premises or in relation to persons, regardless of the period of time for which they remain in force. If I am not right in my assessment, my noble friend will surely tell me.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080624107000097"></a>The first two amendments would extend the Government&#146;s amendment to require or review in respect of all special restrictions and requirements imposed on persons, things or premises. The third amendment would reiterate the concern that regulations which enable administrative orders imposing restrictions or requirements on individuals should lapse when they are no longer necessary and should be subject to regular parliamentary scrutiny. They provide that measures enabling compulsory detention, isolation or quarantine should lapse when they are no longer necessary to meet a serious and imminent threat to public health, or after 12 months. This would require the Government to seek parliamentary approval for these types of regulations on an annual basis. That goes somewhat further than the safeguards suggested by my noble friend.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080624107000098"></a>The Government also propose that where a special restriction or requirement includes detention, isolation or quarantine, the maximum period for which that restriction may be in place without review will be 28 days. Thereafter, there must be a review without application at 28-day intervals. That is welcome in that it makes clear that the review must be unprompted and that it must take place at regular intervals. However, its value is somewhat diminished because the identity of the reviewer is unknown. My noble friend talked about transparency, which is very welcome. I hope that that transparency can be taken a little further so that we would know the identity of the reviewer.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080624107000099"></a>Cases involving detention, isolation and quarantine may involve the deprivation of liberty or interference with private and family life. It is therefore important that a decision of that sort should be reviewed on a regular basis, and by an independent, impartial tribunal. The provision for independent, automatic review of administrative decisions imposing compulsory detention, isolation or quarantine, would be an important safeguard for the right to liberty and the respect for private and family life.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080624107000100"></a>The final amendment would require any detention, isolation or quarantine to be reviewed automatically by a magistrate&#146;s court or another named, independent and impartial tribunal after 28 days. Can my noble friend explain why at least in cases of compulsory detention, isolation or quarantine, there should not be an automatic review after 28 days by a court, or other, tribunal as will be required by the Bill where these restrictions are ordered by a justice of the peace?</p>

That will be an important public health measure. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for having tabled these amendments and getting us this far. The work on this is to be commended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080624107000103"></a>I should like to add my support for the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. During our debates, we focused, quite rightly, on the potential deprivation of liberty of individuals. But thinking back to the foot and mouth disaster of a few years ago, perhaps we underestimated, in our debates, the extent to which people&#146;s businesses and livelihoods can be put in danger. A restriction of 28 days on a farm can be enough to put the farm out of business. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will respond to all the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, but the inclusion of &#147;thing or premises&#148; is important because there is a potential in this for people&#146;s homes and livelihoods to be severely damaged. I wish the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, well and I hope that he gets a speedy response. I also thank the Minister.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, who is not in her place today, had tabled Amendments Nos. 62A to 62D, which seek to make further changes to government Amendment No. 62.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080624107000105"></a>Amendment No. 62A is intended to ensure that the right to review is extended to regulations setting measures against &#147;things or premises&#148;. I can assure my noble friend that the provision does, in fact, already cover these measures. However, I understand that the technicalities of the drafting may not make this clear. I thank the noble Baroness and my noble friend for bringing this to our attention, and I am delighted to be able to say that I can accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080624107000106"></a>Amendment No. 62B seeks to extend the right of review to measures that are one-off measures and not measures that have a specified period. I sympathise with the sentiment. However, I believe that it is unnecessary to remove the wording in question. One-off measures&#151;such as medical examination, or the requirement to disinfect a premises&#151;already have a safeguard at new Section 45F(6). This provision allows an individual the right of appeal. If the individual disagrees with a one-off measure, the appropriate action is to appeal against it, not to seek a review.</p>

I hope that I have reassured my noble friend that this amendment is not needed because these measures can be imposed only if there is a serious and imminent threat. Therefore, it is unnecessary to state in a provision that the regulation must fall when no threat is present, because these powers could not be used if there was no longer a threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080624107000108"></a>We have also spoken a lot about SARS during our debates on this part of the Bill, and it is worth remembering that the SARS outbreak lasted for more than two years. If a similar outbreak occurred, it would be appropriate for provisions to be in place for longer than a year at a time.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080624107000109"></a>Amendment No. 62D seeks to require that all reviews are carried out by a magistrate or,</p>
<ul><a name="080624107000205"></a>&#147;another named independent and impartial tribunal&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80624-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080624107000110"></a>As I explained in Grand Committee, the reason for not leaving the review power with a magistrate is that the purpose of new Sections 45C and 45D is to provide central powers to deal with serious and imminent threats when it may be appropriate to enable a decision-maker other than a justice of the peace to take key decisions at the relevant time. The amendment could have the effect that, in a widespread emergency, justices of the peace could be overrun with applications that could better be determined by an authorised officer applying centrally set criteria under carefully drafted regulations.</p>

<a name="80624-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080624107000111"></a>My noble friend proposes that this problem could be avoided by allowing for independent and impartial named tribunals to hear reviews. Our provision allows the review to be heard by a person determined in accordance with the regulations. That means that the regulations must set out who should be allowed to carry out reviews, and Parliament will be able to debate the appropriateness of these reviewers when the regulations are debated as part of the affirmative procedure. I am not clear what is meant by the term &#147;named tribunal&#148;, but the provision we have offers a sound safeguard for individuals subject to measures under these regulations. Let us not forget that the review is a safeguard in addition to the right to appeal to a magistrate under new Section 45F.</p>

That safeguard requires that where an appropriate Minister or decision-maker is imposing, or enabling the imposition of, a restriction or requirement, they must consider that the measure is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by imposing it.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080624107000119"></a>Amendments No. 61 and 61B remove from this proportionality test the specification of who must consider the measures to be proportionate, and the point in time when that consideration must be made. Amendments Nos. 61A and 61C then require that any measure taken must be proportionate not only to the aim of the particular measure but also that each measure in itself must be proportionate to the overall threat. I have given these amendments a lot of thought, both now and in Grand Committee, and I am still of the view that these amendments would render the provision at best ambiguous, and at worst unworkable. I hope that I can set out why in a way that will convince noble Lords that we are better off with the provision as currently drafted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080624107000120"></a>My first concern with these amendments is that, instead of the provisions requiring the Minister or decision-maker to consider the measure proportionate, the provisions would read that the measure must be proportionate. I sympathise with the intention to ensure objectivity in the test. However, it may simply not be possible, at the time that the decision must be taken, to be absolutely sure that the measure is proportionate to the risk it seeks to address. Such a test does not allow for occasions where the scientific evidence may be weak or where the threat is unprecedented and of an unknown nature. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, put it very eloquently in Grand Committee when she   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1396"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>explained that the measures taken during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong were &#147;taken in the dark&#148; because the true pathogenic nature of that organism was not known at the time.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080624107000121"></a>If the emergency nature of a situation requires that a decision be &#147;taken in the dark&#148;, someone has to make that decision. As I explained in Grand Committee, simply deleting the reference to the person making the judgment that a measure is &#147;proportionate&#148; does not change the fact that such a judgment must be made. Measures are not &#147;proportionate&#148; to threats all by themselves; someone must judge them to be so.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080624107000122"></a>My second concern about these amendments is that they would mean that the measure taken must be judged to be proportionate not only at the point that the decision is taken but also at any given later time. They remove the idea that the proportionality test should be based on whether it was proportionate given the facts at the time of the decision. Instead, they would allow a court, in retrospect, and with further scientific evidence to hand, to look at whether the measures are still considered proportionate, and whether each measure, in and of itself, was proportionate to the overall risk. I have to say that the idea of such a retrospective second-guessing gives me grave concern, especially as the threat of such an examination with hindsight may discourage proper action from being taken at the time to protect public health. I hope that my noble friend Lord Dubs and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, will understand my concerns and feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080624107000136"></a>The Bill provides for an emergency procedure for the passage of health protection regulations. This procedure is very broad and is triggered whenever the relevant Minister considers that it is urgent for the regulations to become law. These amendments would create two emergency procedures comprising an urgent procedure proposed by the Bill, which will apply to all regulations except those which enable administrative detention, quarantine or isolation, and a new emergency procedure, which applies to any regulations which enable the Secretary of State or other persons to order the detention, isolation or quarantine of persons. Therefore, a distinction is drawn according to the seriousness of the consequences for the individuals about whom we are talking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080624107000137"></a>This new formulation meets the Government&#146;s concern expressed in Committee that the urgent procedure was intended for use in circumstances where technical or administrative arrangements might be urgently required by the World Health Organisation. The stricter procedures that I propose are now limited only to regulations which enable administrative orders for detention, isolation and quarantine. I question whether administrative powers to authorise restrictions on individuals, including measures which affect their right to liberty, such as detention, quarantine and isolation, are necessary or are accompanied by adequate safeguards in the Bill.</p>

Could my noble friend explain why, in the circumstances which Ministers have previously highlighted, such as an outbreak of SARS, Ebola or a similarly life-threatening illness, the potentially draconian steps of enabling administrative detention, isolation or quarantine should not be subject to parliamentary oversight on at least the same terms as those provided in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004?

It is extremely scary to think of the way in which different viruses might mutate, resulting in a sudden incidence of high infectivity and mortality rates. Therefore, I am minded to stick with the Bill&#146;s wording and not make decision-making any more difficult. If an emergency occurs, the decision-making will be extremely difficult and I hesitate to put further hurdles in the way.</p>

The procedure allows regulations which contain the relevant declaration to take effect immediately and last for 28 days unless they are rejected by a vote in either House of Parliament and therefore cease to have effect. The regulations must be approved by a vote in each House before the 28th day in order to remain in effect.</p>

Before I set out why I do not think these amendments are necessary, I emphasise that they do not reflect any recommendations put forward by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. As noble Lords know, the Government accepted that committee&#146;s recommendations in full and it has not raised any further issues since.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080624107000144"></a>I understand the reasoning behind the desire to recall Parliament and allow only seven days before a debate on regulations relating to isolation, quarantine and detention. However, I believe that there are already sufficient safeguards in the Bill to ensure that individuals&#146; liberties are respected. All individuals who are placed under quarantine, detention or isolation through regulations will have a right to appeal at any time to a justice of the peace. In addition, they must have an automatic review of their case, whether or not they have used their right of appeal, within 28 days of the measure commencing. These provisions must be included in all regulations imposing quarantine, isolation or detention regardless of when Parliament approves them. I do not believe that it would be appropriate to recall Parliament in every situation where urgent regulations included isolation, quarantine and detention measures.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080624107000145"></a>Reference was made to SARS. If there were another outbreak of an infection such as the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, and experts strongly believed that the UK was at imminent risk, we would want to make urgent regulations to ensure that we had immediate quarantine powers. However, although it would be necessary to ensure that powers were in place immediately, they might not be used immediately. In fact, they might not be used for weeks, months or at all. Their use would depend on whether the risk had materialised.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080624107000146"></a>Such precautionary measures may be urgent but may not have such serious implications as to warrant the recall of Parliament, especially given that isolation, quarantine or detention can be imposed only where the serious and imminent threat is actually present at the relevant point in time. That said, our provisions would still allow the Government to recall Parliament where the threat warranted it.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080624107000147"></a>The amendments would allow the regulations to be amended. If the Secretary of State were to decide that regulations were needed under the urgent procedure, the decision would be taken following important discussion with experts in the relevant fields. Advice might be sought from experts at the Health Protection Agency, senior doctors and scientists, and possibly even international health organisations such as the World Health Organisation. The regulations laid would seek to implement the measures recommended by these experts as necessary to deal with the public threat at hand. In such circumstances, I strongly believe that the decision that Parliament should be asked to take is to accept the measures in full or to reject them.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80624-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080624107000154"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I want to turn a spotlight on to an issue of considerable importance for NHS patients, and that is the issue of exceptional cases. What do I mean by an exceptional case? An exceptional case arises where a PCT receives a request from a member of the public or a clinician for a treatment which is not available through existing contracts or wider commissioning policies. There are several sets of circumstances where exceptional requests for treatment are likely to arise. One example is where new treatments being evaluated by NICE have not been explicitly funded in the operational plans of the PCT. Another is high-cost treatments for rare conditions. A third is where a treatment involves a drug where the requested use would be off licence. Recently a lot of the debate on exceptional cases has focused on drugs for the treatment of cancer but the situation also applies to a range of other conditions and it is clear that the issue will become much broader as more targeted therapies are developed which have smaller patient populations and which are at the same time more expensive. In 2005-06 Peterborough PCT received 156 applications for exceptional funding, of which 15 related to high-cost drugs, 13 to breast augmentation, 12 to pain management and 11 to orthopaedics.</p>

<a name="80624-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080624107000155"></a>It is the duty of PCTs, when an application of this sort is received, to assess the merits of the request. Exceptionality is demonstrated by evidence that the benefit from treatment for a particular patient is &#147;significantly greater&#148; than the benefit which would accrue to a patient with a similar clinical picture. The Faculty of Public Health in an article published three years ago offered three grounds on which a patient can be considered eligible for funding. The first is where a particular development in a patient&#146;s condition for which treatment is required is &#147;wholly unforeseen&#148;. The second is where the treatment would &#147;avert a crisis&#148;. The third is where the use of the treatment in a particular patient has such a major health gain associated with it that it is &#147;truly remarkable in its efficacy&#148;.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80624-0012.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080624107000156"></a>However, all these grounds are quite broad in nature. Given that PCTs are not allowed to issue blanket refusals on the funding of treatments, all PCTs are obliged to consider whether to provide funding whenever a request for an exceptional treatment is received. For this reason many PCTs, though by no means all, have established what can loosely be termed &#147;exceptional  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1401"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1401</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requests panels&#148;. Where such panels exist, they tend to operate to certain protocols in assessing individual requests for treatment. The problem here is that there is no requirement for a PCT to publish its criteria for judging exceptional cases. In the absence of that requirement, members of the public do not know anything at all about the decision-making process. They cannot scrutinise it. That inability to scrutinise is often serious because, in reaching a decision on whether to fund a treatment, it is not uncommon for a PCT to rely on social criteria which, of necessity, involves making value judgments. Once you start doing that, you enter territory that is fraught with difficulty. For example, if a treatment is given to a patient who has young children over and above a patient who is childless, this involves a social value judgment which favours a lifestyle choice to have children.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080624107000157"></a>It is known that judgments of this sort are made, but without a request under the Freedom of Information Act about whether there is a panel&#151;and that is sometimes not manifest&#151;and what sort of social criteria are used, a patient cannot find out how he might be able to build up a convincing argument for why he should be able to receive a particular treatment. There is also a possibility that taking a decision on the basis of social factors could fall foul of the requirements of the Equality Act 2006, which outlaws discrimination on the basis of age and sex. The amendment is needed, therefore, to empower patients. It is needed to ensure that there is transparency in the way that PCTs make decisions to fund, or not to fund, exceptional cases, and it is needed to expose geographical variations in the way that requests for exceptional treatments are assessed. We know that in some PCTs there is a 50:50 success rate in exceptional applications whereas in other areas the success rate is virtually 100 per cent. So where differing criteria and procedures are used in different areas of the country, the postcode lottery that this creates would be made apparent.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080624107000158"></a>I hope the Minister will accept that there is a very real issue here which needs to be addressed. It would be most helpful if she were able to say something about the problems I have outlined and indicate whether she accepts that secrecy about the processes used to make decisions on the use of public money should be viewed as unacceptable in both principle and practice. I beg to move.</p>

In the commissioning cycle, PCTs will need to effectively engage patients and the public, assess needs and prioritise investment. They will have to be proactive in seeking out the views and experiences of the public, patients and other stakeholders and they will need to demonstrate clearly how they are discharging their responsibilities. In addition, they will need to have the capacity to consider applications from clinicians and patients who believe that genuinely exceptional circumstances apply in their particular case. The assessment of such cases requires a delicate balance to be struck between the genuine desire to give an individual patient care that

I understand the concerns that have been expressed about the accessibility and transparency of individual PCT arrangements and I agree that it is desirable that PCTs should publish information on those arrangements. I believe that many already make such information available and I am told by my noble friend&#151;without giving any secrets away&#151;that the next-stage review addresses this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="080624125000007"></a>We are, I believe, in agreement on the good practice that PCTs should follow in making available this kind of information to patients and clinicians, but we think that it is inappropriate to set such a requirement in primary legislation, particularly as there are already systems in place to ensure that PCTs are accountable to their local population for their commissioning policies.

It would be helpful if the CQC were to encourage PCTs to maximise transparency on requests of this kind and in their general approach to considering requests for exceptional treatment.

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080624125000011"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment is about the quality and outcomes framework&#151;QOF&#151;which is a voluntary annual reward and incentive scheme introduced as part of the new GP contract in April 2004. In 2007-08 under the scheme, GPs were awarded 1,000 achievement points for managing common chronic conditions, how well the practice is organised, how patients view the care that they receive and the amount of extra services that are offered. When the new GP contract was introduced, it was agreed that the QOF would be subject to ongoing review and development to ensure that it accurately reflected changing clinical practice and new therapeutic areas. It was agreed that an independent expert group would consider the latest available evidence and make recommendations to the four health departments of the UK and that it would then be up to the negotiating parties to agree any changes to the quality framework.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080624125000012"></a>Since the GP contract came into force, the QOF has been renegotiated twice: once for the 2006-07 contract and once for the 2008-09 contract. Each renegotiation has involved a robust, evidence-based process. For example, in 2006-07, the QOF renegotiation was informed by a review panel comprising the University of Birmingham, the Society for Academic Primary Care and the Royal College of General Practitioners. Following the receipt of 514 submissions, the review panel made recommendations to NHS Employers and the GPC. During the negotiations between the GPC and NHS Employers, the review panel was available to clarify questions of evidence for the negotiating parties.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080624125000013"></a>The 2006-07 renegotiation resulted in a number of small but significant changes; for example, 15 new evidence-based indicators in seven new clinical areas were introduced. This was not in any way a cursory process. The success of those negotiations laid the foundations for the review panel to be placed on a more formal footing. In August 2006, the University of Birmingham was awarded a three-year contract to inform the ongoing review and development of the QOF. A new review panel was constituted, comprising over 40 senior academics who were expert in the field of general practice. The cost to the taxpayer of this three-year contract was nearly &#163;800,000, excluding VAT.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080624125000014"></a>The review panel began its work reviewing the QOF for 2008-09 after receiving 153 completed questionnaires from national societies, patient groups, individuals, pharmaceutical companies, primary care organisations and others. The review panel considered the written questionnaires and then held oral evidence sessions with a number of the groups that had submitted evidence. The QOF negotiations then commenced, informed by the findings of the panel. We know from the BMA that the recommendations submitted by the review panel included two new clinical areas with respect to the management of osteoporosis and peripheral arterial disease, an expansion of the scope of ethnicity monitoring, a new indicator in the area of heart failure and enhancing the points value in the QOF of chronic kidney disease.</p>

The focus was suddenly on supporting improved access to GPs and, in the final agreement, no points at all were allocated to support the areas recommended by the expert panel.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080624125000016"></a>In ignoring the detailed conclusions of the review panel, the Government drew a large amount of criticism from professional and patient groups. Dr Laurence Buckman of the GPC called the Government&#146;s plans,</p>
<ul><a name="080624125000163"></a>&#147;incredibly short-sighted and ill thought out. It seems the Government has scant regard for older and chronically ill patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624125000138"></a>A letter published in the <I>Times</I> on 14 January 2008 and signed by, among others, the British Society for Rheumatology, the Royal College of Nursing, the British Orthopaedic Association, Help the Aged, the British Geriatrics Society, the Royal College of Surgeons and the National Osteoporosis Society, stated that many osteoporotic fractures,</p>
<ul><a name="080624125000164"></a>&#147;could he prevented if patients had an early diagnosis and were put on treatment to strengthen their bones. The new measures proposed for the GPs&#146; contract would have constituted one of the most beneficial and cost-effective reforms in patient care for older people in recent years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624125000139"></a>The letter said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108"></a><a name="080624125000150"></a>&#147;It is therefore particularly regrettable that the Government has not accepted proposals in the new GPs&#146; contract that would have benefited millions of older people at risk of osteoporosis and life-threatening fractures&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080624125000017"></a>The good will of those organisations and individuals who took time to make submissions to the QOF review has been sorely tested. Without some way of ensuring that evidence-based recommendations made by the expert panel are guaranteed some standing in the QOF review process, it is doubtful whether public and professional involvement in attempting to formulate sensible proposals can be maintained at the level that we have seen.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080624125000018"></a>The rationale for the amendment is therefore to ensure that the recommendations of the review panel cannot simply be ignored. This is not just my own idea.

<ul><a name="080624125000165"></a>&#147;the Department should develop a long-term strategy to support yearly negotiations on the QOF and develop the QOF based on patient needs and in a transparent way&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080624125000019"></a>I am aware that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is considering the QOF as part of his next-stage review. I very much hope that he will understand what has prompted me to raise these matters and why I believe that they merit the closest attention. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to indicate in her reply that, if the QOF is to work as originally intended, we simply cannot have a repeat of what happened this year and that safeguards of the kind that I am proposing are in everyone&#146;s interests.

I note that the amendment, as drafted,

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080624125000021"></a>The current QOF independent expert panel already has the function of advising the negotiating parties on the evidence base for indicators in the QOF. However, the expert panel has no remit to advise on the level of payment for achieving QOF indicators, payments to GPs in general or the directions that give effect to those payments. As regards the level of payments that GPs receive for the QOF, or any part of the general medical services contract, the Secretary of State is already required, before giving any directions as to payments to be made under such a contract, to consult any body that is representative of the persons to whose remuneration the directions would relate. It is also open to the Secretary of State to consult any other person whom he might think appropriate.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080624125000022"></a>In addition, the doctors&#146; and dentists&#146; review body can make recommendations on GP pay when invited by either of the negotiating parties, NHS Employers and the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association. Therefore, we believe that the process has many safeguards in place already and that there is no need to set up a new statutory body to advise on payments to GPs, although I thought that the noble Earl made an eloquent case.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080624125000023"></a>I can inform the House that the primary and community care strategy, which is being developed as part of my noble friend Lord Darzi&#146;s next-stage review, is considering the case for developing a more independent process for setting and reviewing quality indicators in the QOF and giving more flexibility for PCTs to address local needs and priorities. It is not necessary to make any statutory change to introduce a more independent process for setting indicators and this would not concern decisions on the levels of payment made for achieving the indicators. I am aware that I may not have addressed the specific points raised by the noble Earl and I will see whether I can write to him about them, but I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That would be helpful. I am sure that she appreciates that my concern lies almost exclusively with the QOF process and the integrity of that process. There is something very wrong if we have, at great expense and trouble, an expert panel that takes evidence from all over the place and considers it carefully, only to find that its recommendations are almost completely ignored, so that the QOF that emerges takes no account of the clinical recommendations. We need a more robust mechanism if the system is to work as originally intended. However, I take heart from the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is looking at this whole area in the next-stage review, as with the previous amendment. Once again, I look forward to what he has to say. If the noble Baroness is able to give me any words of comfort in the mean time when she writes to me, I shall be extremely grateful.

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080624125000028"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment concerns arrangements for the NHS remuneration of community pharmacy contractors. As a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pharmacy, I very much believe in the importance and value of pharmacy services in local communities and I am encouraged by the Government&#146;s recent White Paper, <I>Pharmacy in England:</I><I></I><I>Building on </I><I>S</I><I>trengths</I><I>&#151;D</I><I>elivering the </I><I>F</I><I>uture</I>, which sets out a range of new services that patients and the wider public will be able to access from community pharmacies. The White Paper is based on a report published by the all-party group last year and reflects many of our recommendations.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="080624125000029"></a>The House may not be aware that, on average, community pharmacies derive around 90 per cent of their income from the NHS services that they provide. This means that arrangements for remuneration by the NHS are crucial. Community pharmacists need certainty and stability in those arrangements. That stability enables them to plan and invest with confidence. As it stands, the Bill unnecessarily&#151;and perhaps unintentionally&#151;casts doubt over the nationally agreed arrangements for community pharmacy remuneration and therefore jeopardises plans for investment in existing and new pharmacy services.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="080624125000030"></a>Amendment No. 71 would address that by inserting what I hope the Minister will see as a modest new provision in Section 164 of the National Health Service Act 2006. That Act sets out the arrangements for remunerating community pharmacy contractors. Remuneration is determined by so-called &#147;determining authorities&#148;&#151;either the Secretary of State, primary care trusts or other persons appointed by the Secretary of State. Pharmacy owners need to know the remuneration that they will receive for those substantive parts of the contractual framework so that they will have the confidence to continue to invest in their businesses.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="080624125000031"></a>In Grand Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, confirmed that,</p>
<ul><a name="080624125000166"></a>&#147;the Government remain fully committed to the view that fees and allowances for essential services and advanced services should continue to be determined nationally in negotiation with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and in discussion with the NHS. It is not sensible for pharmacy contractors or PCTs to negotiate such payments on an individual basis&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/5/08; col. GC 629.]</ul>
<p><a name="080624125000140"></a>However, she did not accept the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="080624125000032"></a>Section 164(3) of the NHS Act 2006 allows the Secretary of State to authorise a PCT to exercise the functions of a determining authority by issuing an instrument of appointment. Section 164(5) allows him to set out in that instrument of appointment the requirements with which a determining authority must comply in making determinations. However, although  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1407"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 164(5)(b) allows an instrument of appointment to be contained in regulations, there is no statutory requirement for any particular instrument of appointment to be contained in regulations.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="080624125000033"></a>The Government, I know, recognise the importance to pharmacies and to PCTs of setting some fees and allowances nationally and have given assurances of their intention to continue to do so. However, this is of such importance that any instrument of appointment that seeks to delegate to PCTs the determination of fees and allowances for the national elements of the pharmacy service should be contained in regulations. Section 164(5)(b) already provides that some instruments of appointment &#147;may&#148; be contained in regulations. Amendment No. 71 seeks only that, in relation to these important nationally specified pharmaceutical services, the instrument of appointment must be contained in regulations.</p>

<a name="80624-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="080624125000034"></a>This is of great importance to community pharmacists and to the public who rely on pharmacy services. The amendment would simply put in the Bill the intentions expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in Grand Committee. I therefore hope that it will prove acceptable to her today or at least that she will undertake to consider the matter before Third Reading. I beg to move.</p>

He is right that community pharmacists rely on the NHS element of what they do for the bulk of their business. That is what makes their businesses viable. It is also true to say that community pharmacies deliver to the NHS a level of service that is way above what they are contracted to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080624125000036"></a>Those of us with friends who are pharmacists know, having discussed these matters with them, that lots of studies show that, to be viable, a parade of shops must have a shop to buy newspapers, somewhere to buy food and a pharmacy. Community pharmacies provide a huge amount of preventive healthcare information, but they are struggling. The amendment, which the Government could easily accept, would guarantee pharmacists some stability with which to underpin their businesses. If the Government were to do so, that investment would pay for itself in the additional services that community pharmacies would offer in areas with the greatest health poverty. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

As well as providing important frontline healthcare information, community pharmacists know an enormous amount about the community they serve. They know when someone has been chronically ill.

Quite often, if you go into a community pharmacy, you find that the community pharmacist is providing bereavement support after that person has died. They are also a source of

They are also able to identify youngsters who are at risk, for example, of unplanned pregnancy, and are able to have a quiet word with them in a non-threatening environment that is not associated with making an appointment to see the GP. Young girls go into the local chemist to get their tampons and sanitary towels, so they are used to going in and out, and under that aspect health promotion advice can be provided. We would lose community pharmacy services at our peril. It would not be until they had gone that we would find the negative health impact, particularly on the older population, those with disabilities and those who are lonely and isolated for whatever reason and of whatever age. That health impact would be devastating, and if we costed it, there would be an enormous cost to the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080624125000039"></a>This amendment removes the current discretion in Section 164. It provides that the instrument of appointment must be set out in regulations when the Secretary of State appoints a determining authority for the remuneration of those services. The Government have already given a number of commitments on the record during the passage of this Bill that the Secretary of State will continue to set the fees and allowances for the national elements of the community pharmacy contractual framework in line with provisions in Section 164(3)(a) of the National Health Service Act 2006.

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="080624125000041"></a>However, having listened carefully to the arguments made, I am persuaded that there should be further consideration of the need for an amendment to place the requirement on the Secretary of State. I accept that this is a matter of continuing concern, and it is justifiable for that reassurance to be given. We have made the commitment today and previously, but things change, and I am prepared to consider further that this should be underpinned by a statutory requirement, and to bring it back at Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="080624125000046"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, Clause 136 makes it possible for private health providers who are contracted by the NHS to treat NHS patients to join the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts. As noble Lords will be aware, this scheme is administered by the NHS Litigation Authority. The question raised by Amendment No. 72 is whether it is appropriate and right for this arrangement to be voluntary. As the Bill stands, it means that an NHS patient who suffers negligent harm from a private provider may not have access to the same system for redress as an NHS patient harmed in an NHS trust. There is a fundamental issue of principle here, which is that all NHS patients, no matter where they are treated, should be guaranteed the same rights and the same system for obtaining redress. The amendment makes it possible for the Secretary of State to direct that any body which is eligible to join an indemnity scheme by virtue of providing NHS services must join that scheme.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="080624125000047"></a>In tabling this amendment, I have been advised by Action against Medical Accidents, which has already seen examples of confusion over who is liable for negligent treatment when NHS patients have been harmed by private providers, such as independent-sector treatment centres. This sort of situation quite literally adds insult to injury. If an NHS patient is injured by an NHS trust, his claim is overseen by the NHS Litigation Authority. The NHSLA has a reputation for dealing with claims more expeditiously and, I know AvMA would say, more fairly than private insurers or medical defence organisations. I hasten to say that I am not casting aspersions on my friends in that sector who do a very conscientious job. I am not in a position to agree or disagree with AvMA&#146;s assessment, but the central point of principle remains valid. It would be unfair for an NHS patient who happens to have had his treatment commissioned from a private provider not to be dealt with in the same way as someone who has been treated in an NHS hospital. If the treatment is NHS treatment, liability should reside with the NHS. AvMA tells me that in its experience patients who have to sue private organisations or individual doctors find the process even more stressful than making a claim with the NHSLA.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080624125000048"></a>Of course, we always need to think carefully before building into statute any provision that interferes with contractual freedoms. However, which is more important: allowing a private provider to arrange its own indemnity cover and thereby creating unfairness and confusion for NHS patients; or predetermining this aspect of private-provider contracts and by doing so making

It is surely not satisfactory to contemplate a situation in which, after negligent treatment by a private provider, an NHS patient is effectively disowned by the NHS and left to seek redress from a large commercial organisation or its insurers.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="080624125000049"></a>I should add that the amendment would also theoretically make it possible for the Secretary of State to consider extending NHS indemnity to cover GPs, dentists and other primary care practitioners providing NHS treatment. I should make it clear that I am not advocating that idea. It is not the point of the amendment. My concern relates to independent providers of NHS secondary and tertiary care. I should be glad if the Minister could tell us whether she would be willing to look at this issue again. I beg to move.</p>

A situation can arise in which a patient is treated in the private sector, something goes wrong, they land in A&amp;E and something else goes wrong. It is difficult to know whether the NHS or the original private sector provider is culpable. At the moment, the NHS is picking up and sorting out problems that have arisen when people have gone into the private sector for whatever reason.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="080624125000051"></a>It would be helpful for the Minister to clarify this, because the NHS seems to be carrying an unfair burden of responsibility, partly because it deals reasonably and rapidly and recognises the distress that patients are in when they try to take action, and partly because it is so difficult to take action against a private sector provider, particularly as they may be disparate and there are multiple contractual layers to the problem. I will not detain the House with numerous examples, but after the debate I would be happy to discuss with the Minister some that have come to mind. This problem is of real concern and involves the interface between episodes of care and how those are clearly defined.</p>

When care services are being put out to tender, it is common practice for those who are invited to tender to have to take out insurance cover. This is usually very large and very expensive. I would not want a number of independent providers to be priced out of, or to struggle to meet, tender specifications because of potentially very large insurance claims, only for this to result in a situation where, if there were an episode, it was deemed that the NHS was responsible for the claim all along. This has even more layers to it than one might have anticipated at the beginning. Therefore it would be extraordinarily helpful to have a clear statement on it.</p>

We intend to open up for trusts a specific scheme, the clinical negligence scheme, that covers healthcare providers for clinical negligence liabilities arising from the provision of NHS care. The clause will extend the potential scope of this scheme so that we can allow non-NHS providers to obtain this cover when delivering NHS care. That is quite clear in the Act. The current legislation allows the Secretary of State to require prescribed NHS bodies to become members of this scheme, because it is right that bodies whose finances are under the control of the Secretary of State for Health may be directed to make such an arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="080624125000055"></a>However, Amendment No. 72 would extend this power of direction so that the Secretary of State could also require NHS foundation trusts, let alone independent sector providers of NHS care, to become members of such schemes. If the intention of the amendment is to ensure that all providers delivering NHS care have adequate indemnity cover, I could not agree more with the noble Earl, Lord Howe. However, the amendment is not the right way to achieve this. I am sure noble Lords will agree that the Government should not be able to direct or to seek to manage the day-to-day running of organisations that have greater freedom from government to control their own budgets. Specifying the indemnity scheme that they must join would be micromanaging foundation trusts&#151;a debate that we have had throughout the passage of the Bill&#151;and independent providers to an unacceptable level.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="080624125000056"></a>Instead, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that every provider delivering NHS care has appropriate arrangements in place to protect patients. I am happy to confirm that, as part of the national NHS contracts, this will be the case. In other words, every contract with an independent provider will set out very clear arrangements for that provider for the indemnity schemes that we may wish to see from them. We will require all of them to have indemnity cover as part of their NHS contract where such risks are present. This means that these providers can choose the type of indemnity cover that best meets their needs, and that patients can be assured that appropriate indemnity arrangements will always be in place.</p>

I am more than happy to put that in writing, but she touched on something that is also close to my heart. If a patient comes into a hospital and is ill, it is our duty to look after them, irrespective of whether their treatment was private or under the NHS. I therefore do not see that as an issue. I regularly come across issues such as that, and I think that it is most unprofessional to say, &#147;Actually, you have received this treatment elsewhere&#148;. I will try to address that issue later.</p>

I do of course thank him for what he has said. I also thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker, Lady Masham and Lady Finlay, for their support. It is reassuring to hear that the contract with private providers will require adequate indemnity cover to be in place. I had assumed that that would be so, but the issue runs broader than that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080624125000060"></a>If the Minister does not feel that any amendment to the Bill is appropriate, it would be helpful to have some assurance from him that commissioners of NHS services from private providers would in the normal course of things aim to make it a condition of their contract with the provider that they join the clinical negligence scheme for trusts to cover their NHS patients. We cannot insist that they take out cover of a particular kind to cover their private patients, as that has nothing to do with the NHS. In the case of NHS patients, however, it has everything to do with the commissioner. Such an assurance would go a long way and does not seem that outlandish a thing to ask for, given that a number of other conditions to private-provider contracts will be mandatory, not least adherence to the NHS complaints procedure in respect of NHS patients. If the Minister feels able to look at this again, I am sure that that will be welcomed in many quarters. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080624125000071"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this draft order, which was debated and approved by the House of Commons Delegated Legislation Committee on 3 June, seeks to effect the transfer of functions relating to two health Acts from UK Government Ministers of the Crown to Welsh Ministers. The draft order contains functions under Section 86 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and Section 259 of Schedule 21 to the National Health Service Act 2006. The proposed transfer of functions has the approval and support of the Department of Health, the Ministry of Justice and, of course, the Welsh Ministers.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080624125000072"></a>The relevant powers of the Secretary of State under Section 86 of the Mental Health Act 1983 apply to patients detained under Part 2 and Part 3 of that Act. Your Lordships may recall from our consideration of the Mental Health Bill last year that Part 3 of the 1983 Act relates to patients concerned in criminal proceedings or under sentence, while Part 2 relates to those often referred to as &#147;civil patients&#148;; that is, patients whose detention in hospital does not involve the courts. Section 86 applies only to patients detained under Part 2 or Part 3 of the Act who are neither British citizens nor Commonwealth citizens with the right of abode in the United Kingdom. The powers in Section 86 are to remove the person from a hospital in England or Wales and to send them to another country.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080624125000073"></a>Section 86 provides that, before exercising the power of removal, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure that a patient receives proper care and treatment in the other country and that removal would be in the patient&#146;s best interests. Before exercising the power of removal under Section 86, the Secretary of State must obtain the approval of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, an independent judicial body concerned with determining whether a patient continues to meet the criteria for detention under the Act. It has the power to discharge a person from detention.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="080624125000074"></a>As set out in Section 86(3), the Secretary of State shall not exercise the power except with the approval of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Responsibilities for<I></I>mental health matters are devolved to the National Assembly for Wales under the Government of Wales Act 1998. At the time of the original transfer of functions in 1999, which covered the Mental Health Act powers, Section 86 remained the responsibility of the Home Secretary. These powers subsequently have been transferred to the Secretary of State for Health in respect of unrestricted patients and to the Secretary of State for Justice in respect of restricted patients by the machinery of government changes which took place in 2007.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080624125000075"></a>At present, Welsh Ministers are dependent on the Secretary of State for Health to exercise the powers of removing a patient who is receiving treatment for a  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1414"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mental illness from Wales to a country abroad. Given that health falls within the executive competence of the Welsh Ministers, it would be appropriate for them to exercise Section 86 functions. Most of the functions exercisable by the Secretary of State for Health in England are exercisable by the Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="080624125000076"></a>This draft order makes it clear that there will be no transfer of functions relating to Section 86 for patients who are subject to a restriction order or direction under Section 41 or Section 49 of the 1983 Act or a hospital and limitation direction under Section 45A of that Act, which, I am sure noble Lords will appreciate, is key. These will remain with the Secretary of State for Justice, who will exercise those functions in relation to England and Wales, which, also, is key. That reflects the current settlement and arrangements regarding such patients. The Welsh Ministers are not seeking to change those arrangements.</p>

<a name="80624-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="080624125000077"></a>There are potential benefits to be gained from the proposed transfer of Section 86 functions to the Welsh Ministers for Part 2 patients and unrestricted Part 3 patients. The Secretary of State for Health currently exercises functions under Section 86 in relation to Wales on the basis of advice from health service bodies in Wales, which are part of NHS Wales. The Secretary of State has no statutory control over NHS Wales; it is the responsibility, as we know, of Welsh Ministers, so it is appropriate for this function to be transferred. For hospital managers in Wales, the transfer of Section 86 powers would provide consistency with the exercise of other functions within the MHA 1983 which are exercised by the Welsh Ministers.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="080624125000078"></a>If Section 86 powers are transferred, there will be a direct benefit to patients. Let me exemplify that point: currently, hospital managers in Wales inform the Secretary of State for Health that a patient needs to be removed from a hospital in Wales under Section 86. Subsequently, either the hospital managers or the Secretary of State for Health will refer the case to the independent Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales. After the tribunal has considered the case, it passes its advice and recommendations to the Department of Health and the Secretary of State for Health. The transfer process will be expedited by virtue of hospital managers in Wales being able to make direct requests to Welsh Ministers, who will then be able to take the decision regarding removal, based on the advice of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, without the need to refer the matter to the Department of Health and the Secretary of State for Health. The line of responsibility and accountability will be greatly clarified as a result of the transfer of functions. The proposed transfer of functions under Section 86 will set right the anomaly in how powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 have been transferred to Welsh Ministers. There are no significant cost issues relating to this transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="080624125000079"></a>The proposed transfer of functions under Section 259 of Schedule 21 to the National Health Service Act 2006 in relation to the sale of good will of medical practices would give Welsh Ministers the responsibility and power to grant certificates stating that no good will has been sold. Subject to specified exceptions, the sale of good will of medical practices is prohibited  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1415"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under Section 259 of the Act. Schedule 21 makes it an offence to sell good will contrary to Section 259, which provides that any person proposing to be a party to a transaction which they think might amount to the sale of good will of a medical practice has to ask the Secretary of State for Health for a certificate confirming that the transaction does not give valuable consideration in respect of the good will. This function is currently exercised by the National Health Service Litigation Authority on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health for England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="080624125000080"></a>No issue arises regarding cross-border practices. The premises are being sold, not the patients registered at the practice. If the premises are physically in England, the National Health Service Litigation Authority would continue to be responsible for issuing a certificate confirming that no good will has been sold. The transfer of functions order would make the Welsh Assembly Government responsible for issuing the same certificates to GP practices in Wales. There are no major financial implications relating to the proposed transfer of functions under Section 259 and Schedule 21, as the small administrative costs in dealing with cases will be funded from existing resources.

This is the first draft instrument to be made under the Government of Wales Act 2006. As the Minister rightly said, it relates to Section 88 of the 1983 Act and Section 259 of Schedule 21 to the NHS Act 2006. The process, as a result of the Government of Wales Act 2006, transfers powers to Welsh Ministers. Previously, these functions were transferred to the Assembly. This clarifies the difference between the Executive, in the form of the Ministers, and the Assembly, which can now concentrate on scrutiny and revising. Some say that this dilutes democracy in Wales, but previously there was a lot of confusion over the role of the Assembly. As a result of the 2006 Act, Welsh Ministers can be more accountable to the Assembly, which can, if necessary, give them a very hard time. In that respect they represent the people of Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080624125000083"></a>We approve of the principle of the transfer of powers found in this statutory instrument. The draft order relates to the provisions in the Mental Health Act 1983 regarding the movement of detained patients subject to guardianship between England and Wales and any country abroad. It also relates to Section 86 of the Mental Health Act 1983 where a patient is receiving treatment for mental illness in a hospital. This applies on the one hand to patients concerned in criminal proceedings or under sentence and on the other hand to civil patients detained in hospital. Obviously, patients involved in legal proceedings remain the responsibility

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080624125000084"></a>We support this transfer of powers, as it is entirely in line with the devolution settlements of 2006 and 1998 whereby the National Assembly for Wales was given responsibility for mental health. The line of accountability will now be much clearer. Where the restriction orders are in place, it seems entirely logical for direction to remain, for the time being, with the Secretary of State for Justice. The National Assembly for Wales and its Ministers do not have powers in relation to criminal law, although eventually this may change. Section 259 of Schedule 21 to the National Health Service Act 2006, which refers to issues relating to GP practices and the prohibition of the sale of good will, us entirely sensible. We agree with this order.</p>

<a name="080624125000085"></a><a name="80624-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80624-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080624125000193"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> My Lords, I too welcome the context in which the draft order is presented and its contents. The general context is that of devolution, and it bears out the famous words of Mr Ron Davies when the Welsh Assembly was established that this was the beginning of a process rather than a single happening. Here we have the transfer of two fairly limited executive functions to Wales. The Section 86 transfer gives Welsh Ministers jurisdiction in relation to civil patients in mental hospitals and thereby removes an anomaly that has existed for quite a long time.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080624125000086"></a>Anybody who has had any dealings with the Home Office in relation to the Mental Health Act 1983 will appreciate that the boundary between health jurisdiction and that of the Home Office runs right through that Act. I can remember some conflict when I had the pleasure of being a Junior Minister in the Home Office.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080624125000087"></a>The anomaly exists because this situation was entirely at the join between the jurisdictions of those two departments. When, in 2007, that situation was resolved as far as England and Wales were concerned generally, by allocating the criminal functions to the Home Office and the health functions under Part 2 of the Act to health Ministers, clearly Wales had to follow suit and remove that anomaly. The protection for the individual remains and the rules remain basically the same for Wales as for England, save that the executive decision will now be made by Welsh Ministers. It would have been entirely absurd for the certificate on the sale of good will under Section 259 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to have been granted in relation to a Welsh situation by anybody other than a Welsh Minister or, more correctly, the body advising on behalf of the Welsh Minister.</p>

It is surprising, bearing in mind the volume of activity in this field, that something has not come along earlier. Be that as it may, we welcome it very much. I hope it is indicative of the way in which devolution in Wales will develop along three paths: first, under Part 3 of the Act; secondly, as far as ministerial transfers are concerned; and, thirdly, the framework provision transfers which we have already been concerned with over the past few years. The

Whatever truth there was in that, we now have the division between the Executive and the National Assembly, making the Welsh Assembly much more in the outline of a Parliament than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="080624125000089"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, mentioned a matter which I had considered while looking at these papers: whether one was taking power out of the hands of a democratic Assembly&#151;as would have been the case before the 2006 legislation&#151;and transferring it to the single hand of a Minister. I think that it was in 1935 that Sir Gordon Hewart wrote his book <I>The New Despotism</I>, describing how jurisdiction and authority moved from the Benches of the other place and this House to the hands of a single Minister. For the past 75 years, it has been one inexorable drift in that direction. Although I agree to some extent with the point of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, we must accept that, and it has long been accepted.</p>

One presumes that, as every such order makes its administrative way to Cardiff, the Wales Assembly gains in confidence and status. The process may well evidence a further accretion of powers by the Wales Assembly Government&#151;powers that it has sought and that most people in Wales will surely agree with. In that, we are observing a further maturation of the Wales Assembly&#146;s achievement. &#147;More constitutional creep&#148; is not the phrase that I am thinking of, but it is something like that. One hopes that this legislation will lead to more and better governance; good governance is surely the objective of what we are discussing. I hope too that it aids better services for ordinary people at the grass roots; that surely is another objective of such legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080624125000091"></a>The subject of mental health is important. I recollect as a Welsh Office Minister receiving advice from the now noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies. As a special adviser in the mid-1970s he gave wise advice to Ministers, and we made advances in mental health in which he had an important role.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080624125000092"></a>I ask the Minister to tell us of an instance of the sale of good will. In paragraphs 7.9 to 7.12 of the Explanatory Memorandum, there are references to professional procedures that are somewhat puzzling to the lay person. What amounts of money might be paid for good will? Is it many thousands of pounds? Can she furnish us with an example to illuminate our proceedings?</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080624125000093"></a>However, the transfer of functions order regarding medical practice and certificates must surely be the right procedure. I wish this legislation well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="080624125000095"></a>Having read the brief debate held in another place, I am satisfied that the basic essence of this statutory instrument is to be applauded and agreed to. The honourable David Jones challenged the Minister in another place, Huw Irranca-Davies, about various costs and the question of how good will might be handled, and was answered satisfactorily by him.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="080624125000096"></a>I do not feel the need to go on longer, except to say that we all appreciate that anything to do with mental health and its patients needs a soft and sensitive touch. I believe that the order will clarify the route that needs to be followed and make it simpler.

The wealth of experience and the quality of contributions is truly enlightening for me. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, reminded us of the historic importance of the transfer of functions under the Government of Wales Act, which I did not mention in my somewhat lengthy introduction to the order. I welcome his support for it and am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, took the time to examine the proposed transfer with his eagle eye and give us the benefit of his analysis.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="080624125000098"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, for his reassurance that my honourable friend in the other place was able to answer his colleague&#146;s questions adequately. My noble friend Lord Jones was concerned to find out if there had been payments for good will made following the sale of premises or property owned by GPs&#146; practices. No such payment has been made for good will, precisely because this is about ruling out such payments.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="080624125000099"></a>I offer further clarification to my noble friend: the good will that we are talking about is the value of what a GP practice may own other than tangible assets such as premises and equipment. For example, good will may be derived from the provision of an out-of-hours service, additional or enhanced services or non-medical business assets. Good will relates to the intangible factors that give a practice a good reputation and encourage patients to register with that practice. We are also talking about the issuing of a certificate to show that there has been no sale of good will: that is the important point. I hope that noble Lords will agree to the order. I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="080624125000102"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we have just debated the order that confers executive functions on Welsh Ministers. This draft order, covering charges for non-residential social care services, will confer legislative competence on the National Assembly for Wales under Section 95 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. Noble Lords will recall that we previously approved an order giving legislative competence to the National Assembly for Wales relating to children and young people with additional learning needs.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080624125000103"></a>The Order in Council process created by the Government of Wales Act 2006 provided an improved mechanism to enable the Assembly to achieve its legislative priorities. No longer must the Assembly fight for space in future Queen&#146;s Speeches for Westminster Bills. As noble Lords are aware, these orders are subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses and the approval of the National Assembly for Wales. Parliament decides on a case-by-case basis whether legislative competence in a certain area should be devolved. Many questions must be asked to make this determination. Is it appropriate for the Assembly to have legislative competence in this area or would it be better remaining at a UK level? Has a clear case for powers been made? Is the scope of the order appropriate to allow the Assembly to legislate effectively in this area? The details of any measure that the Assembly Government wish to pass&#151;the Welsh equivalent of an Act of Parliament&#151;are not for the Government or Parliament to consider. They will be wholly for the National Assembly for Wales to scrutinise.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080624125000104"></a>On 20 May, the National Assembly considered and unanimously agreed the order that is before this House. Subject to the agreement of this House this evening, and that of the other place next week, the order will confer further legislative competence on the Assembly in the area of social welfare, which has been largely devolved for many years. This will enable the Assembly to pass measures concerning charges that may be levied for non-residential social care services, and payments made to individuals to purchase such care directly.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080624125000105"></a>The primary piece of legislation governing charges for non-residential social care is Section 17 of the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983. Section 17 gives local authorities a discretionary power to recover such charges as they consider reasonable from adult recipients of non-residential social services. The only restriction on any authority&#146;s power to charge is that it shall not require users to pay more for services than would appear to be reasonably practical. This has resulted in significant differences between the charging policies of local authorities in Wales, and therefore wide variability in the impact on service users. There is a wide range of hourly charge rates and weekly maximums set by local authorities, and differing amounts can be charged by different authorities for similar services. There is also a disparity in the way that benefits and disability-related expenditure are treated in an individual&#146;s assessment. The Welsh Assembly Government believe that the current marked disparities need to be tackled. They argue that service users deserve a charging system that is both transparent and consistent in the way that it operates.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080624125000106"></a>The Assembly Government can currently provide statutory guidance to local authorities on charging under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. However, local authorities are able to depart from such guidance and its impact has been limited as a result. It is for the purpose, therefore, of providing the National Assembly with the legislative tools to achieve this clear objective that this order has been brought forward.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="080624125000107"></a>The order was considered by the Constitution Committee, the Welsh Affairs Committee and a committee of the National Assembly for Wales. This process of scrutiny was rigorous and provided members of the committees, along with interested parties and stakeholders, an opportunity to comment on and question the order. I thank all those involved in carrying out this vital scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080624125000108"></a>I am pleased to say that the committees supported the order in principle and raised only technical and definitional issues for further consideration. All recommendations arising from their final reports have been considered carefully, and the draft order before the House today reflects the outcome of that consideration.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="080624125000109"></a>Many of the committees&#146; recommendations arose from the fact that the order, which was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny, was reliant on elements of another proposed order covering vulnerable children and child poverty for definitions and exceptions. Many of the definitions in that order were referred to in this order; there has been a lot of discussion about that in the pre-legislative scrutiny. However, the order before us has been laid in advance of the vulnerable children order, and a number of definitions and exceptions have been inserted into it as a result. I am confident that these changes address the concerns raised by the committees.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="080624125000110"></a>The order will enable the development of the type of distinct &#147;Made in Wales&#148; legislation in this area of policy that the Government envisaged in the Government of Wales Act 2006. It will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to continue to improve the lives of some of Wales&#146;s most vulnerable people. The order supports its strategic aims to promote independence and equality for people receiving social care in Wales. It will give the Welsh Assembly Government the means to support their independence further by regulating the setting of charges and removing the wide disparities that currently exist. I therefore commend the order to the House and beg to move.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="080624125000113"></a>There are several issues here: the political one relates to legislative competence orders. Your Lordships will be faced with debating a host of legislative competence orders in the forthcoming period. The noble Baroness  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1421"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made it quite clear, as have the Government, how careful we need to be to ensure that this is, on all occasions, the right road. I do not feel, and neither does my party, that it is right to pass legislative competence orders, then pass the buck to the Government of Wales and let them get on with it. That must never be allowed to happen. However, it is different where the Government of Wales have competence&#151;that is the key issue. I hope that the competence of the Government of Wales will increase steadily as they continue to bed down and rule Wales.</p>

<a name="80624-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="080624125000114"></a>There is another point arising from the order which I am a little concerned about. It appears that this statutory instrument will in some ways reduce the autonomy and powers of local authorities. I am not saying that that is necessarily a bad thing but in political terms your Lordships will be only too aware&#151;probably more than me&#151;that these issues can become very sensitive between a local Government, in the form of the Assembly for Wales, and local authorities, where powers are inevitably shared.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="080624125000115"></a>It is also important in future debates on legislative competence orders and particularly on this one which seems to do some very good things. I am not being negative about this particular statutory instrument&#151;quite the reverse. The objective of this instrument is to smooth out and make fairer the benefits that are available, and to make sure that there are not rich counties and local authorities and poor ones dishing out different amounts of assistance. It is also complicated to some extent by the fact that the recipient has to contribute to the package. That is yet another balance that has to be taken and I would be interested to ask the noble Baroness what sort of criteria will be required to decide how much a particular recipient should contribute. Is it related to the total size of the package, which in my opinion it probably should not be, or the wealth of that person? It seems that there is plenty of room for negotiation. I wonder how it will take place and who will be negotiating with whom in order to arrive at the objective of this statutory instrument, which is that it is seen across Wales as a fair package which is justifiable and one where everyone is getting a fair deal. The statutory authorities should be seen to be doing an excellent job in providing this assistance in a fair and&#151;this is a very important word&#151; consistent way. In general and for the purposes of this debate, we support the passing of this statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="080624125000117"></a>This order concerns charges for social welfare services. There is an excellent set of definitions in the explanatory notes, setting out why these services are going to be entitled social care services. That is a result of the scrutiny which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to, with the Welsh Affairs Committee and others who have clarified the terminology somewhat.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="080624125000118"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, this has the potential to be more controversial than the previous order. Unfortunately, it has the potential to take power away from local authorities and, not only that, it  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1422"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>impacts on the charges for non-residential care services by local authorities which are, as we all know, strapped for cash. The fact that the Welsh Assembly Government settlement of county and borough councils has not always been generous in recent times, for reasons we all know, has meant that in some cases social services budgets have not been adequate. As a result, levels of charging have often varied from county to county. The costs of rural services, for example, are often greater due to population scarsity, demography and logistical problems of providing services. Deprivation is a problem in all parts of Wales, whether metropolitan or rural. Fairer charging for social care services is a very worthy objective, but local authorities know their citizens&#146; needs very well indeed. The possibility of Welsh Assembly Ministers imposing a regime of standard charging rates on councils may produce inequities in the provision of social care services. I am not saying it will, but it might do so.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="080624125000119"></a>It is clear that Assembly Members will have to be vigilant in relation to Minister&#146;s executive powers of charging rates. We are in for a fairly sparky time in the Assembly over this subject. One accepts that in specific situations it may be desirable to achieve even a nil charging rate, as exemplified in the notes, but no one should underestimate the inherently high costs of delivering these services. We cannot forget that Labour promised us free social care services, for example, but then it could not deliver them because the budget would not allow it. There is an amazing statistic: 400,000 people in Wales are disabled. It is a very high percentage of the population, including the working population. The number is understandable because we have a huge legacy of a culture of hard and sustained physical work in mining, heavy industry and agriculture. I have some of those aches and pains at the moment.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="080624125000120"></a>We support this order with the reservations stated. However, the order will have to be implemented with great sensitivity. It addresses only non-residential care by local authorities; residential care is in a different world entirely. With the House's indulgence, I should just like to mention that the Royal British Legion is considering closing its only care home in Wales. One reason is the mix of local authority residents and ex-service people. The Royal British Legion says that the local authority&#146;s pay structure will not maintain the care home&#146;s economic viability. However, huge negotiations are under way to try to rescue the situation.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080624125000121"></a>This legislation is a good move forward on domestic care at home for those in need. We have to support it in a way which we hope is intelligent while at the same time pointing out some of the elephant traps on the way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="080624125000123"></a>I hope that as more and more of these orders come to this House there will not be a feeling that in some way or another one should legislate only at a minimum level. That would be to defeat the whole purpose of Part 3 of the Act and the whole tenor of Part 3 in  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1423"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 1423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relation to Part 4. If anybody asked me exactly what policy one should adopt, I would say an Icarus policy. Do noble Lords remember the story of Icarus? He and his father had been exiled on an island and the only way in which they could escape was by manufacturing large wings from birds&#146; feathers and beeswax. They had to fly not so high as to make the sun melt the wings and not so low as to run the risk of running into the sea. I think that that is the sort of approach that we should have in Wales. It should be constructive, substantial progress; it should not be too revolutionary, but on the other hand it should be well above a minuscule level that would have little significance.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="080624125000124"></a>The content of the order is entirely reasonable. The area that it covers is charges by local authorities for non-residential care. It may be limited to domiciliary care or it may be wider than that; I am not sure from reading the draft order. Be that as it may, it seems obvious that the policies&#151;not just in Wales but also elsewhere in the United Kingdom&#151;of trying to treat people more and more in their homes and on as few occasions as humanly possible in hospital will increase in volume and become of greater significance with each passing year. Therefore, when we consider these charges levied by local authorities, we should allow them as much scope and flexibility as is reasonably possible, but at the same time try to achieve not a total uniformity but as much consistency as is reasonably justifiable, bearing in mind the different characters of different parts of Wales. Those principles are probably easier to articulate than they are to execute, but that is what the order does.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="080624125000125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, worries about local government powers being reduced. I would say that local government powers here are extended in both directions. However, it is of course possible that, in practice, there might be a reduction. The only change that we will be bringing if the order is agreed is this: whereas before the Welsh Assembly, through its Ministers&#151;the Assembly in the first instance and, since last year, through its Ministers&#151;was able to give stern advice to local authorities, that advice had only to be morally regarded, not legally so. In some instances the local authorities might have gone contrary to the advice, but now they cannot because it is no longer advice but firm rules of a legislative nature.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="080624125000126"></a>This order does not legislate. It does not create anything of itself. It is right that we should remind people in Wales, who are rather confused, exactly how Part 3 works. A legislative competence order made under Part 3 does not grant any authority to the Welsh Assembly. It gives the Welsh Assembly the ability, in one of the 20 fields&#151;they are referred to as fields in Schedule 5&#151;ranging from agriculture to the Welsh language, to designate an area of jurisdiction and legislative authority. If the Welsh Assembly does nothing about that, then nothing has been transferred. All that is transferred is a potential&#151;a right to build on that part of the field, or a part of that part that has been designated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="080624125000127"></a>I hope that we will soon see Assembly measures following closely on legislative competence orders so that the Welsh people can see what is built by way of legislative authority in this connection. In that way, I

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a><a name="080624125000160"></a>&#147;A Legislative Competence Order (LCO) describes an area in which the National Assembly for Wales is competent to make legislation&#151;the implication being that it will be able to turn this into law for Wales in future. This LCO relates to Social Welfare&#151;Vulnerable Children and Child Poverty.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_119"></a><a name="080624125000161"></a>&#147;Play Wales strongly advocated the inclusion of the word &#145;play&#146; within the interpretation of &#145;well-being&#146;, which currently relates to &#145;education, training and recreation&#146;&#151;and our call was heard and acted upon.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_120"></a><a name="080624125000162"></a>&#147;It may seem strange to celebrate the inclusion of one word in potential legislation, but play is so often overlooked as being a vital part of children&#146;s lives that to find it included in the LCO meant we jumped up and down whooping with joy in our office&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624125000141"></a>This statement by Play Wales evidences one happy customer of Her Majesty&#146;s Government in the consultation process, on orders at least. Play Wales/Chwarae Cymru is an all-Wales organisation that works in tandem with the Welsh Assembly Government. It is a successful organisation with a dedicated leadership. It surely stands ready to advance the good intent of this order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="080624125000130"></a>Dysfunctional families and unhappy children are not rare. Recently, the Dewsbury case of Shannon Matthews came to national prominence. As a commentator wrote, it was a tale of childhood misery in Britain. One hopes that the order will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to reach out into the counties of Wales to make life better for all the people of Wales, but especially for every vulnerable child.</p>

Again, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, gave us a great description of how the process works and reminded us that we should not congratulate ourselves too much, because we are creating potential rather than passing legislation. It was a clear explanation, and I am grateful to him for it.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="080624125000132"></a>It is good to hear from my noble friend Lord Jones that there are some happy customers out here. This is the beginning of this LCO process. Before this potential legislation even gets as far as becoming a real Welsh Assembly measure, there will be a significant level of consultation. That is the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="080624125000133"></a>I will briefly answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on local authority discretion. From the Government&#146;s point of view, removing what we would describe as local authorities&#146; current wide-ranging discretion on how much to charge for non-residential social care is, I am afraid, unavoidable if the Assembly Government are to address the present significant disparities and introduce a fairer and more consistent approach to charging. That is the reality of this LCO; the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, highlighted his concerns about that. However, we must remember that, for local authorities in Wales, only 15 per cent of the cost of providing these non-residential services is recovered by the charges. So we must have some perspective and a sense of proportion over the concerns about the effect on local authority funding that the noble Lord raised. It is useful to note that we are talking about 15,000 individuals currently being levied a charge for these services; that is the order of magnitude.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="080624125000134"></a>Still, we are talking about a significant concern for the people of Wales. There is a clear discrepancy between charges, which sometimes occurs in localities

We are talking about significant ranges.</p>

<a name="80624-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="080624125000135"></a>As noble Lords pointed out, we are giving the Welsh Assembly the opportunity to legislate on this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked what criteria would be established regarding the changes in charging. That is a matter for the Welsh Assembly to decide. The objective is clear and is set out in the LCO, but the content of the relevant measure, and the range of criteria that might be included, will be decided by the Welsh Assembly. It is essential that consultation is carried out as the measure will be very much made in Wales. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08062486000112"></a> Before Clause 42, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

</ul><ul>

</ul>(a) his assessment of the appropriate levels of staff and resources in the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,(b) the progress that has been made towards reaching that target, and(c) the effect on progress towards approval of new nuclear reactors.&#148;
<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: A substantial part of the Bill is designed to allow nuclear installations to be built more quickly. As was mentioned by many noble Lords at Second Reading, the Bill is part of a three-pronged approach to establishing a secure low-carbon energy industry; the other parts consist of the Climate Change Bill and the Planning Bill. The Planning Bill is intended to streamline the planning process for large-scale infrastructure works. Nuclear build is undoubtedly part of that. It is therefore difficult to approach this matter in its entirely while scrutinising this Bill alone. However, the amendment addresses the problem of streamlining the process for nuclear development in a more general fashion.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000010"></a>We all agree that if new reactors are going to be built, they must undergo the most rigorous scrutiny to ensure long-term durability and safety. Considering the amount of growth that might be expected in the nuclear sector, it is important to make certain that we have the resources to keep up with this growth at a crucial stage in the development of nuclear build; namely, the approval of new reactors. This amendment would require the Secretary of State to assess what levels of staff and what resources would be required to ensure that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate will be able to handle the potential growth in this industry.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000011"></a>In addition to assessing staff levels and resources, the Secretary of State would be required to report on what progress is being made to provide any support  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC562"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is needed. This report would also come to bear on the effect of staffing levels on the efficiency of approving new reactors.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000012"></a>It is of paramount importance that new build should not be unduly held up only because there are not adequate resources to approve new reactors. If progress is going to be made in this direction, it would be sad to see the Government&#146;s lack of foresight as the cause of delay; that might put off further investment and deprive the country of a valuable energy supply. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000013"></a><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062486000121"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> Despite the opposition of those on these Benches to new nuclear build, I am not opposed to the amendment. If new nuclear reactors are going through the planning process and are to proceed, it would be irresponsible to put planning requirements in their way. However, I question the staffing level; I refer to the problem encountered with new reactors that have already been built, especially those in Finland and certainly one in France. Both reactors have had major problems with the strength and durability of the concrete-containing vessels. That is a key component to any nuclear reactor and has delayed both reactors coming on line. It would lead to significant reductions in the serviceability of the reactors. In view of the importance of each reactor and how long they are expected to last&#151;our current reactors are expected to last a good 10 years longer than they were designed to do&#151;cutting down on any safety requirements for the sake of bringing the reactors on line far quicker would be of concern, especially if that were due to understaffing. That could be an issue, although I take it that that was not the purpose of the amendment. I doubt whether the Government will accept the amendment but I hope that, if they are minded to do so, they should assure us that safety is a priority in any new nuclear build.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000014"></a><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062486000122"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I, too, support the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, referred to the French reactors being built at Flamanville and in Finland. I discussed this at some length last year with people from Areva, and the Finnish reactor is quite interesting. Their argument is that the delays&#151;there certainly have been delays&#151;and the additional costs that have flowed from them have been almost entirely due to very slow decision-making by the Finnish regulators. Areva has had to wait for long periods between the different stages of building that reactor, which I think is at Olkiluoto, and it felt that it was being not very well treated by the Finnish regulators.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000015"></a>So far as concerns the station being built at Flamanville&#151;the other one that the noble Lord mentioned&#151;I contacted EDF when the first complaint about the French regulator was announced a few weeks ago and, although it has recently been given much higher prominence in the British press, for reasons about which one can only speculate, the EDF people were not overly concerned about this. They agreed to say that they were not complaining about the activities of the regulators, which they recognise have to be thorough and persistent.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000016"></a>In connection with Flamanville, one understands that the French regulators have been concerned to ensure that there is no backsliding. As the design of the EPR reactor has become more settled and two  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC563"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plants are now under construction, EDF entirely recognises that it is appropriate that the regulators should make absolutely certain at every stage that all the safety and quality requirements that they lay down are being met. The French regulators have been quoted as saying that they had become aware of certain slapdash practices&#151;I paraphrase their words; I am not sure what they were in French&#151;and that they were very concerned to stop that happening. However, when I discussed this with the senior management at EDF a few weeks ago, they were not concerned that the regulators were acting in any way improperly. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, referred to the paramount importance of safety in this&#151;the NII has had a remarkable record in this over the years&#151;and it is right that they should be held to that.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000017"></a>Secondly, there was a good deal of publicity surrounding the visit of President Sarkozy to this country. There was talk of a lot of collaboration between the British and the French on nuclear matters and a reference to including regulation. I took that up through a parliamentary Question, in which I asked whether this was likely to lead to a mutual approval process, whereby something that had been approved by a regulator in one country could be accepted by the other. If I were a Minister, I would be extremely cautious about that. That was the nature of the reply that I received&#151;that there was no intention that there should be any mutual recognition of the standards. Without knowing all the details, it is difficult to work out exactly what this collaboration amounts to, or whether it is something that was put in as an embellishment or to add, as Gilbert would have said, &#147;corroborative verisimilitude&#148; to an otherwise unconvincing narrative of collaboration between the two countries.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000018"></a>My third point is the reason why I support the amendment. It has been well known in the industry for some time that the regulator has had difficulty in recruiting qualified people to fill the gaps. After all, the authorities broadly said for the best part of 10 years that they were not interested in nuclear power and that all that they would try to do was keep the nuclear option open. It may interest the Committee to know that Professor Robin Grimes runs a programme at Imperial College called KNOO&#151;Keeping the Nuclear Option Open. When I suggested to him after last year&#146;s White Paper that he might like to change the title, he said, &#147;No, there&#146;s far too much goodwill being invested in the name of KNOO&#148;. So the KNOO it is. But this is the basis of the problem. With Ministers being firm in making it clear to their officials that they were not interested in nuclear new build, but only in decommissioning and the treatment of waste, it was hardly surprising that the chief inspector of the NII found it difficult to recruit. It was initially a problem of pay. However, after great fuss, he eventually obtained a significant uplift in the maximum that he could offer to future members of the NII, which has certainly helped matters. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that, with those enhanced rates of pay, the chief inspector, Mike Weightman, is able to recruit the people whom he wants for the work that he is now doing, which covers not just new build but decommissioning and the preparations for waste disposal  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC564"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and so on. But it is new build, particularly the approval of the new designs, which is taking a good deal of his time.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000019"></a>Mr Weightman made it clear to a meeting that I attended that the inspectorate was proposing to break with previous traditions. Instead of one announcement&#151;&#147;Yes, this is being approved&#148;&#151;he proposed that there should be a series of announcements as each stage of the approval process was reached, which would give greater certainty and enable potential investors in new nuclear build to take the matter forward without there being a long gap.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000020"></a>I am trying to put the amendment into context. Regulation, particularly of new nuclear build, is hugely important. I hope that the Government will smile on the amendment, because the public need regular reports on the process of regulation. That is what the amendment would achieve. I fully support it.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000021"></a><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08062486000123"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> I, too, support the amendment, as all parties seem to do. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, made an important point about the regulator. Safety is of paramount importance, bearing in mind particularly how ill informed is the press on virtually all matters, particularly the future supply of energy. We need a regulator to make certain that safety is implemented to its fullest extent. I support the amendment wholeheartedly.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000022"></a><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08062486000124"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken to the amendment and to the noble Baroness for having introduced it. She triggered off exactly the debate that I think she anticipated and hoped for about our preparations for the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. It took on board the point which the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, emphasised: the crucial role of safety in these developments.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000023"></a>We are certainly not complacent about this issue. We recognise companies&#146; concerns about the assessment process. Steps are being taken to resolve the issue. I assure the Committee that the Government and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate are committed to continuing to improve the recruitment and retention of inspectors where possible.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000024"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who generously said that there had been a pay increase to encourage greater recruitment of inspectors. He has been zealous over many years in emphasising the interim period before the decision on the development of new nuclear power.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC565"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wave of new nuclear reactors. Through that period, he identified necessary measures which the Government were concerned to continue, especially in courses being continued in universities enhancing the skills of those who were to take up those roles.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000027"></a>He referred to the need for the pay rates which obtain at present to be competitive. I am grateful to him for having recognised that an initiative has been taken on that very recently&#151;as recently as last November, there was an increase in the salary of the NII's nuclear inspectors. The purpose of that was both to retain those who work so competently in that crucial field and to aid the recruitment of new inspectors, who will undoubtedly be needed against the background of the increased level of work that we all anticipate.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000028"></a>Reference has been made to the work of Dr Tim Stone. One purpose of his review is to consider how the inspectorate is equipped to review the new build proposals through the generic design assessment process. Another is how to enhance the culture of the organisation for it to be able to adapt to the demands of new nuclear build. I recognise the challenge.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, introduced one obvious aspect of that: anxieties expressed by the French about their installation at Flamanville. Our perspective on what the French have done is that it showed the French inspectorate in rather a good light. It was quickly on to the issue; the French regulatory oversight proved to be effective. It highlighted very early in the areas of potential weakness in the management of construction, seeking improvement.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000030"></a>There is no evidence of basic design weakness in the reactor, but nevertheless that was important, especially given, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned, the increased level of co-operation envisaged, not least by President Sarkozy on his visit to the United Kingdom. We want to find ways in which co-operation can take place. That will not lead to the sharing of respective regulatory decision-making. That is a matter of national responsibility and the French would be no more keen on such shared responsibility than we are, despite the effusiveness of the president about co-operation during his visit to United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000031"></a>The regulators may come to different regulatory conclusions regarding the acceptability of aspects of the EPR design, but they will share experience and technical findings from the safety and security assessment of the EPR design during the licensing process. They will look at ways of dividing up assessment work on specific aspects of the design as well as looking for opportunities to exchange staff. We all recognise the advantages that that can potentially bring. In other words, the collaboration is not the shelving of national responsibility for the safety of our reactors, but the likelihood that we will achieve the challenging GDA completion targets more readily and thus give greater confidence that new nuclear power stations will be up and running in line with the clearly defined energy targets for which the nuclear programme is intended to make its contribution.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000032"></a>I assure the Committee that the regulators are recruiting to build up their capacity to manage the greater workload that is anticipated. They are investigating   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC566"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other measures to help manage GDA more efficiently, such as closer working with and secondments from overseas regulators, particularly the French, and increased use of technical support organisations for their work. These issues are all part of the Stone review on what needs to be done.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000033"></a>We welcome French involvement in nuclear build, and we welcome the opportunities that the president of France indicated should be taken up in terms of collaboration between the two countries on the guarantee of safety. But that does not alter the fact that the Committee is concerned with a Bill that will regulate the British industry for which the British Government will alone be responsible. We will merely benefit from the contributions from elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000034"></a>Dr Stone announced his initial findings of the review at the investors&#146; conference on 12 June. He identified a number of short-term measures needed to help the NII to recruit, retain and support, and recommended that a human resource firm be appointed to support current recruitment activities, although we all recognise that a crucial aspect in that is the level of remuneration offered. He wanted a review of the existing employment terms and reward structures, and recommended that management level secondees should be appointed to provide support functions for the national inspectorate in order to allow inspectors to concentrate on the roles that they alone can perform. After all, they have specific expertise and, as we all know, it is relatively rare expertise. That is why recruitment is challenging, although it is going on apace. It is important that those who are recruited have their skills, expertise and abilities directed towards the primary job; which is inspection with regard to the safety of the design and implementation rather than broader management strategies. People with other skills may be employed to fulfil that role, which is what Dr Stone was concerned to emphasise.</p>

When does he expect the final report, or will Dr Stone be involved in a continuing assessment? I can ask the question in different words if that would help.</p>

Whether Dr Stone will be employed continually may be a matter for later decision, but it is intended that following the interim report that has just been published, there should be a final report from him in the autumn. It will cover all aspects with which he has been charged, some of which he has been helpful in identifying himself as crucial issues to be considered.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000038"></a>I want to direct myself to the actual terms of the amendment, which, as noble Lords indicated, places an additional reporting burden on the inspectorate. The Government believe that most of the requirements of the amendment are already achieved through other means and we are concerned about the additional burdens that the report would place on the inspectorate.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC567"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC567</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000039"></a>I want to outline the nature of reporting that is already undertaken on both the nuclear inspectorate resourcing and the generic design process. The information that would be provided as a result of the amendment is already produced by the Health and Safety Executive as part of its business strategy. Information on HSE and nuclear inspectorate resources are also published in the HSE annual report. In addition, the nuclear directorate of the HSE produces an annual plan of work that sets out how the directorate intends to conduct its work over the coming period. All of that information is available online. The committee will recognise that of all the many responsibilities that the Health and Safety Executive has, the nuclear industry is bound to be of paramount importance. We all know that it is more demanding in terms of safety than any counterpart area for which the HSE has general responsibility.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000040"></a>With regard to reporting on the progress of the generic design assessment, the regulators produce public reports on each design being assessed at the end of each step. Those reports set out the findings of the regulators on each design and set out areas for further work as the generic design assessment proceeds. That process is not, as we would expect, carefully monitored but is reported at regular stages.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000041"></a>It is also worth noting that with regard to reporting arrangements, as the nuclear inspectorate is part of the Health and Safety Executive, through the relevant Select Committee Parliament can require the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to report to it on matters that fall within that department&#146;s remit. That gives flexibility for Parliament without adding an unnecessary burden on the Government or the nuclear inspectorate. That is already a line of responsibility to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000042"></a>Turning to the generic design assessment process itself, I am pleased to say that step three of the process is now under way. This phase looks at the design safety overview of a particular reactor. As part of the process, the nuclear inspectorate has created a process review board that provides external scrutiny of the assessment process and suggests areas for improvement for its next stage. To enhance the process further, the inspectorate is also seeking to build on relationships with overseas regulators, of which the French relationship that I identified earlier is of very great significance. Building on information from overseas regulators will improve the inspectorate&#146;s understanding of the designs and allow regulatory decisions to be made in a timely manner.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000043"></a>I am not sure any joy is ever derived from anxieties with regard to the nuclear industry, but if any is to be derived from the anxieties identified by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, and to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, made reference, it is the fact that we can learn from the experience of others relating to new build. In the same way as the inspectorate does, potential operators and vendors can also help the process by ensuring that the inspectorate receives timely, good quality submissions when requested. We expect that that will occur.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000044"></a>We are well aware of the important issues that the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment raises around the resourcing of the nuclear inspectorate. We are continuing to make improvements in this area and can point to some substantial ones that have been made in recent months. We are making good progress on the generic design assessment process, which will be subject to regular reporting. We believe, therefore, that the existing methods of reporting, including answerability to Parliament, are adequate. I hope the noble Baroness will feel reassured sufficiently to withdraw her amendment.</p>

However, do the Government appreciate the anxiety that will build up in Parliament over the next six years as power station after power station shuts down and people begin to realise the danger of the situation? It is easy to talk about the facts, and of course they have to be thought about, but the anxiety in Parliament will probably focus on the problems identified by the inspectorate. That is why this particular amendment pinpoints what will be a big problem. Do the Government understand just how urgent this is?</p>

That is why the issue of the disposal of nuclear waste, for example, has been the subject of much debate in the press and the media generally. Given our programme for the closure of existing nuclear power stations, the public are aware of changes in the industry, and of course the development of new build will raise concerns. None of us is unaware of the fact that the nuclear industry promotes such anxieties and it behoves the Government to follow the pattern established by previous Administrations&#151;after all, the nuclear programme existed for many decades before this Government&#151;which is that the safety of the public is paramount in the design, commissioning, construction and maintenance of facilities, and of course in the legacy we inherit from existing reactors of nuclear waste that needs to be disposed of safely and satisfactorily. I recognise the validity of the points made by the noble Baroness and hope that in my response I have been able to give her some reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000049"></a>So much is going on in this area. We know about the Stern review and the interim reports, and I hear what the Minister says about collaborations with the French. In the midst of this tangled web of reporting, we will ask again and again for direct reporting and for things to be put in the Bill so that the people of this country, Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the Opposition can see exactly what is going on and when, so that it is not too late.

I would like to pursue it. Clause 101, the extent clause, states that this is the only part of the Bill that does not apply to Scotland. I understand that the reason is that the present Scottish Executive say they do not intend to allow any new nuclear power stations to be built in Scotland. They intend simply to refuse planning permission. Energy provision is, rightly, a Westminster matter, but under the Scotland Act, again rightly, planning is devolved to Holyrood.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000054"></a>The present Scottish Administration&#146;s anti-nuclear stance is political, but it will not necessarily last for ever. A new Scottish Executive may want&#151;indeed, they may find themselves impelled&#151;to bring new nuclear power stations to Scotland. Even the present Executive may find that unavoidable. It seems not only sensible but properly responsible to include in the Bill now this provision for decommissioning and clean-up for the building of new nuclear power stations in Scotland. Otherwise, if and when new nuclear build is back on the agenda in Scotland, new legislation will be required and vital time will be lost, when it is obvious that the situation is likely to be increasingly urgent.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000055"></a>I am not clear whether we at Westminster are free to make this change, or whether the Scottish Parliament would have to agree to it first. Under the Scotland Act, energy generation and health and safety are reserved to Westminster and environmental matters are devolved. Can the Minister tell the Committee where responsibility for this part of the Bill lies, as far as Scotland is concerned? I suspect it is, as it were, a hybrid part of the Bill&#151;there are elements of both. It is important that we know that.</p>

I note that the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, is with us and he may have something to say about this which would be very interesting. I would be grateful if the Minister could cast light on the position. It is a pretty important matter which could become very urgent, and if we cannot change the Bill now, it would seem highly irresponsible of all concerned. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000057"></a><a name="80624-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08062486000133"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I could not resist the opportunity to rise after the noble Baroness&#146;s remarks. In the first instance, the separatist Administration at Holyrood want to pick a fight on energy in any way that they see fit. It is a question of political judgment as to whether or not we respond at any time&#151;by &#147;we&#148;, I mean Westminster&#151;and whether it is appropriate at the moment. One of the failures of the Scotland Act is that we left opportunities for the frustration of the execution of reserve powers to the Parliament by means of legislation that does not relate to the functions that might be exercised.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000058"></a>One could say that defence of the realm is a UK responsibility, but were we to seek to improve the facilities for the nuclear submarine fleet at Holy Loch, we might well find that that would be contrary to the separatist Administration&#146;s interpretation of the planning legislation. One must consider the matter from a number of standpoints. In the short term, on the construction of new nuclear power stations, it is fair to say that Hunterston B will not be ready for decommissioning until the middle of the next decade and Torness will at the earliest be in about 2019-20. Whether or not Scotland requires two additional nuclear power stations or whether it requires two reactors of, let us say, 2,000 megawatts in total, is not for us to pass judgment on. It is for us to exercise our political judgment on whether we want to pick a fight on such an issue at this time.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000059"></a>One area has not been given anything like sufficient attention. That is the waste currently lying in Chapelcross station in the south-west of Scotland, just off the M74 and almost within sight of the English border&#151;for that matter, probably as close to Sellafield as any nuclear installation in the country. It would be a toss-up between Heysham in Morecambe Bay and that station. There is waste there; there is concern about whether it should be stored there in perpetuity or whether it should be treated at the appropriate place&#151;and certainly taken to Sellafield for storage.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000060"></a>At the moment, nothing is happening because of the anti-nuclear posturing of the separatist Administration. That is an issue, but, again, is it worth a fight? Those of us who&#151;like the noble Baroness, I am sure&#151;read the Scottish press at the weekend know that every weekend there is an energy press release from the Administration. Every third weekend, it is anti-nuclear. One is invariably about Scotland's oil; another is about anything in general relating to energy; the third is anti-nuclear. I am genuinely at a loss to know whether it would be desirable to pick a fight at this time. We should be looking at revisiting the devolution settlement and preventing the planning legislation being

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000061"></a>I have responded to the challenge, but I am not sure whether the Government need to act at present. There are fights that are worth having right away and others for which we would be better waiting for a little longer. One problem in Scotland is that we have not dealt with the need for additional nuclear power in a sufficiently aggressive manner. We have allowed the debate to be dominated by assorted well intentioned tree huggers and malign separatists. The issue requires rather more vigorous attention than it has yet received.</p>

I was frightened to hear the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, talking about a fight. My views about the Scottish Executive are well known, certainly on the Floor of the Chamber. The last thing in the world that anybody would want is a fight between Westminster and Edinburgh on the subject of defence or fuel, but we are in a serious position long term looking at our fuel security. I support very strongly what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said.

<p><a name="08062486000067"></a>Devolved matters are waste disposal, environmental discharges and planning. Reserved matters are safety, electricity generation in the broad sense and nuclear security. It is important to get that straight at the start. Given the energy challenges that we face in the United Kingdom and the role that we believe nuclear power stations should and will play in meeting them, it is of course regrettable that the provisions in this chapter do not apply to Scotland. The UK Government&#146;s position is that should the view of the Scottish Executive towards new nuclear power stations change, we will seek to apply these provisions as soon as possible. But not daring to go into the difficult, not to say dangerous, world of Scottish politics, I have to say that I am not

I have to make that point, although I do not know how it will turn out on the night, as they say.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000068"></a>It is established that some aspects of the clauses that we are considering relate to the disposal of radioactive waste, and the disposal of radioactive waste in Scotland is a devolved matter. Therefore, to apply these clauses in Scotland, as the noble Baroness rightly said, would require a legislative consent motion named after my noble friend Lord Sewel. The Scottish Executive have made it clear that, given their opposition towards new nuclear, that consent would not, to put it mildly, be forthcoming.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000069"></a>It may have been possible to gain that consent if the UK Government had been willing to dilute the powers in the forthcoming legislation. However, frankly, we are not willing to dilute the robust level of taxpayer protection that these provisions provide just in order to gain that agreement. Furthermore, as the Scottish Executive has made clear again, under devolved powers, any application to build a new nuclear power station in Scotland would require consent from Scottish Ministers under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. The Scottish Executive is on record as saying that any proposals from the industry to build a new power station would need to be considered on its individual merits. However, the Scottish Executive has also said that it is unlikely that proposals for the industry for new nuclear generation would find favour with the Scottish Government. As I said, should the policy change, we would seek the agreement of the Scottish Parliament to extend this legislation at the earliest opportunity. The noble Baroness should know that we in Government share the same frustration that she and the other speakers in this short debate in Committee made clear.</p>

Everyone in Scotland wants the Scottish economy to grow; I doubt that anybody does not want to export energy&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord does. To say that because we have two nuclear power stations we may not want to replace them is pretty bland. I rather hoped that we might have a number of nuclear power stations in Scotland, for which we are eminently well placed. I hope that the noble Lord does not really feel that Scotland has to be singled out in this way. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, for what he said. I am a little discouraged: I hoped that it might be possible to make the change. It may still be possible, but I have not done the sums about how a vote would go.

<p><a name="08062486000075"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 43, 44 and 45. All the amendments in this group relate to different aspects of consultation on nuclear decommissioning programmes.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000076"></a>Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 are designed to specify who should be considered as an &#147;interested body&#148; during consultation on the approval of the programme. It is sensible to include in the Bill provision for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to be consulted. We understand that the NDA might play a role in any event and that it reports directly to the Secretary of State. However, specific inclusion would enshrine in law what might be intended as matter of course. We also feel strongly that the relevant local authorities should be consulted. Decommissioning programmes have the potential to have enormous impacts on them.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000077"></a>Amendment No. 44 would make a similar change to Clause 46 and include the local authority among those organisations invited to make representations about proposals to modify a nuclear decommissioning programme. It seems good practice to include the local authority before programmes are approved and formal submissions on changes to a programme are made.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000078"></a>The final amendment in this group would extend the consultation on guidance to include the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and any relevant local authority. The impact of a programme on the local community could be wide-ranging&#151;on transport, for example. The effects would best be understood by those in the local authority, who might be helpful in pointing out local concerns that would otherwise have been missed by centrally imposed guidance. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000079"></a><a name="80624-gc0002.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0002.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08062486000141"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> We support the amendment on the basis that local communities will be involved through the local authority. One of the problems with the privatisation of many of the companies with which we are concerned is that there do not seem to be many access points to long-term decisions, and we cannot get a great deal more long term than nuclear waste because it will be with us for generations to come. Therefore, I hope that the Government will add local authorities to the Bill, because it may make the process much more acceptable to local communities. Sellafield is very popular locally because of the jobs associated with it, but if storage was to take place in other places, one would have to make sure that the local population was happy with the situation. One of most important aspects of that is ensuring that decision-making is inclusive and that information is spread through local authorities.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000081"></a>The purpose of a funded decommissioning programme is to ensure that the operator sets out the steps to decommission the power station and to manage and dispose of the waste that is produced. The programme will also have to contain the information that sets out the estimates for the costs of those activities and how those costs will be accrued.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000082"></a>As the Bill stands, in discharging his responsibilities in relation to a programme, the Secretary of State is required to consult with the Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency in England and Wales and the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, where appropriate, prior to making a decision about whether to approve or reject a programme or propose a modification to a programme or prior to making regulations or publishing guidance.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000083"></a>The purpose of the duty on the Secretary of State to consult with the interested parties is to ensure that a programme submitted for approval or any subsequent modification conforms to the safety and environmental requirements of the relevant regulatory body. The parties I have named have expertise in relation to nuclear safety, security and environmental matters. It is also to ensure that any decision that the Secretary of State might make&#151;for example, to impose certain conditions or additional obligations or, equally, to issue guidance&#151;does not adversely affect the existing regulatory structures for the nuclear energy sector. For example, it might not be helpful for the Secretary of State to approve a modification to a programme submitted by an operator that would not be acceptable, say, on environmental grounds to the Environment Agency.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000084"></a>I shall briefly set out how the various bodies referred to in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments are already involved in any potential new nuclear build, how their relationship to the provisions in this section of the Bill is different to that of the interested bodies and why, because of this, I am unable to support these amendments. I am going to talk about each body in turn, rather than speak to each individual amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000085"></a>The amendments that concern local authorities would require the Secretary of State to consult with them when exercising his duties. We believe that they add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the Bill&#146;s provisions and would not enhance the level of scrutiny given to funded decommissioning programmes. We do not believe that local authorities always have the competence to assess the technical or financial content of funded decommissioning programmes, especially given that the primary focus of these provisions is about ensuring that appropriate financial security is put aside to decommission the power station and clean up the site on which it stood. In our mind, such a statutory requirement would simply place further burdens on already pretty burdened local authorities. These additional burdens would result from the local authority&#151;on occasion, certainly, if not on the majority of occasions&#151;having to seek external advice on the detailed content of the programme in order for them to engage in a meaningful way with the whole process.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000086"></a>Of course, we recognise the enormous experience that local authorities have in the field of planning and their role in assessing the impact of infrastructure projects on the local community and representing those interests through the planning process. However, there is a difference between these roles and the roles performed by the interested bodies that are more closely affected by decisions made by the Secretary of State under the nuclear provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000087"></a>Where a new nuclear power station is proposed, existing arrangements will allow local authorities to be involved in that process. In the future, when the independent Infrastructure Planning Commission is established through the Planning Bill, which is in another place as we speak, local authorities will continue to be consulted on the proposed development prior to construction. The local authority will be able to scrutinise all relevant aspects of the proposal, such as the impacts of transport and traffic flow.</p>
<h5><a name="08062486000118"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000088"></a>Later, were a change to occur to a power station, for example, following a modification to a decommissioning plan, and that change amounted to a &#147;development&#148; within the meaning of the planning legislation&#151;such as constructing or demolishing a building&#151;then planning consent would be required and at that point the local authority would again become involved. However, there may equally be modifications which do not constitute a &#147;development&#148;&#151;that is, they would not have an impact on the local community&#151;and in those instances the local authority would, quite rightly, not need to be consulted. In other words, getting the appropriate involvement is important. We think that that is rightly through existing processes and not through the framework established under the Bill.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000089"></a>I believe it is appropriate that the Bill grants a statutory role only to the bodies that have a responsibility for health and safety, security and environmental matters. In our view, there is already the right balance of formal and informal consultations with local authorities to deal with concerns that they might have regarding a nuclear power station in their community. We think that the Bill as drafted strikes the right balance.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000090"></a>Local authorities and local communities are of course represented on British Energy and NDA site stakeholder groups, and we would expect new nuclear power stations to be similarly involved in local communities. These are important forums; they help to establish long-term relationships between local residents and operators of nuclear power stations throughout the lifetime of a plant.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000091"></a><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08062486000143"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> Do those forums have a statutory basis? If the nature of the relationship, set out in the Bill, between the companies and the local authorities changes, they may no longer have any relevance.</p>

<p><a name="08062486000092"></a><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062486000144"></a>Lord Bach:</b> As I understand it, they do not have a statutory basis. These are the engagement activities that the NDA and British Energy currently undertake with local communities. Before I sit down, I shall have a response for the noble Lord about what may happen in the future.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC576"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC576</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000093"></a>Amendments Nos. 42 and 45 affect the NDA. They propose that, similar to the position for local authorities, the Secretary of State should statutorily consult the NDA in relation to a funded decommissioning programme. However, because the NDA&#146;s functions are different from those of the interested bodies, we believe that the amendments relating to consultation with the NDA do not align with the intended purpose of requiring the Secretary of State to consult the Health and Safety Executive and the environment agencies.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000094"></a>The requirement to consult the nuclear regulators is there to ensure that any programme, or modification to a programme, meets the health, safety, security and environmental requirements of the relevant regulator. Frankly, including the NDA in that as a statutory consultee would have no impact on this process, because the NDA has work within the regulatory framework set by the regulators. It primary activity is to decommission the public nuclear legacy programme at 19 designated sites and to progress work on the geological disposal facility.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000095"></a>In relation to waste and new nuclear power stations, the <I>Managing Radioactive Waste Safely</I> White Paper, published earlier this month, confirmed that the NDA will be the implementing body for the geological disposal of higher-activity nuclear waste. In undertaking that responsibility, the NDA will have to work within the constraints required by the nuclear regulators. For example, the waste acceptance criteria that the NDA will set for the geological disposal facility will involve input, and ultimately approval, from the regulators.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000096"></a>Only operators who package their waste to meet the waste acceptance criteria will be able to dispose of their waste in the facility. Therefore, developers will have to propose in their decommissioning programmes to package waste in a manner consistent with these criteria. Because the regulators will consent to the waste criteria, if any proposed programmes or modifications are inconsistent with them, the regulators will be able to register their concerns through the existing provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000097"></a>In short, we do not believe it is necessary to make the NDA a statutory consultee as well. The existing arrangements are sufficient to ensure the engagement of the authority where that is necessary. In addition, as an agency of my department, we are already in regular contact with the NDA and if the Secretary of State required any additional specific information, he can do so through the normal channels of government.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000098"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 42 and 54, which relate to the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. CoRWM&#146;s primary task will be to provide independent scrutiny of the Government&#146;s and the NDA&#146;s proposals, plans and programmes to deliver geological disposal, together with robust interim storage, as the long-term management of the UK&#146;s higher activity wastes. CoRWM&#146;s role in relation to individual funded decommissioning programmes is analogous to that of the NDA; that is, it is strategic and not at the individual programme level. Given our policy on the disposal of waste, CoRWM will play an important independent oversight role in relation to new nuclear power stations through the existing mechanisms proposed  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC577"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC577</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the White Paper I referred to a few minutes ago. It will undertake dialogue with the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, the NDA, local authorities and other stakeholders, and will liaise with appropriate advisory and regulatory bodies to provide annual reports of its work.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000099"></a>The structure and remit of CoRWM reflects the fact that to maintain its independent position, CoRWM itself cannot be part of the implementation machinery, neither should it assume any of the constitutional roles of Government or the statutory roles of either the NDA or the independent regulators.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000100"></a>I want to take this opportunity to highlight briefly the other oversight mechanisms that we are putting into place. Where we approve or reject a programme, or a modification to a programme, the Secretary of State will be able to rely on the verification of detailed technical information and advice from the nuclear liabilities funding arrangements board&#151;to be called, I understand, NLFAB&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08062486000101"></a><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062486000145"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> Could the noble Lord say that again?</p>

Information will also come from trustees of the independent fund and other related specialists. The board is being set up to provide the Secretary of State with the right level of technical and financial scrutiny. It will be thorough and the advice provided by it will be made public.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000103"></a>I have spoken for long enough on these amendments. However, I need to come back to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, and the question he put to me about local engagement groups. We expect that the developers of new nuclear sites would want to form similar groups. They make good sense, especially in terms of enhancing public acceptance of what is going on in the interests of the developers themselves as much as anybody else. I want to stress that energy companies and we in government remain committed to openness and transparency in the development of new nuclear power stations through local community involvement.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000104"></a>For the sake of completeness and in case I got it wrong&#151;I did&#151;I point out that NLFAB stands for the Nuclear Liabilities Financing Assurance Board.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062486000105"></a>I am afraid that I have to disappoint the noble Baroness yet again in not accepting these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080624103000003"></a>The noble Lord said: Those who took part in the Second Reading will remember that I spoke at some length about the arrival on the scene of an American company called Energy<I>Solutions</I>. I gave the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, notice that I would refer to it and after the debate he drew me aside to say two things: first, to express his gratitude that I had warned him that I would talk about this company, but he went straight on to say, &#147;I think it would be very helpful if you were to meet some of my officials&#148; to discuss matters arising from my speech. I had had such a meeting previously, which the noble Lord, Lord Jones, had suggested, on a different matter and I therefore readily agreed. Indeed, we have now agreed to a meeting at 1 Victoria Street, at which I hope to discuss these matters.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000004"></a>One of the points that I sought to make in that reference to this rather remarkable American company, based on the information that it has been kind enough to give me, is that it has an approach to decommissioning and waste disposal that in some respects differs from that which has been seen to be the accepted norm in this country. It occurred to me that the firm was asking people to think out of the box. At my subsequent discussions with Energy<I>Solutions</I>, I believe that that is what it seeks to do. It has held discussions with various regulators in this country, which are ongoing.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000005"></a>This matter suggested to me that the circumstance may arise when a company has set aside funds for decommissioning and its share of waste disposal&#151;I shall come in a moment to the question of what is meant by &#147;its share&#148;&#151;and it appears subsequently that the funds that that company has set aside are considerably higher than will actually be necessary. Technology advances, and Energy<I>Solutions</I> believes that it is at the forefront of technological advance in this field. Indeed, it has made a number of innovative approaches to this whole issue. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, was quite right to interrupt me in my speech to say that this will be required not only to be subject to regulation in this country, which is right, but to go through the normal testing and contracting system.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000006"></a>Energy<I>Solutions</I> already has a substantial contract with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority for a number of the Magnox stations in the south of the country; so the company is not completely unknown to the authorities here.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000007"></a>If I had been more accurate I would have tabled the amendment to Clause 46, which is the one where the Government can respond to a proposal to modify an approval. Clause 45 is where someone can approach the Government for a modification, and Clause 46 is the process to be applied when that happens. I therefore have a question for the noble Lord, Lord Jones&#151;and I express our wish that he may be restored to health.</p>

<p><a name="080624103000012"></a>The amendment sprang from what I had told the noble Lord, Lord Jones, I was going to talk about, and what I talked about at Second Reading. The question is, if you have a contractor who is able to come along and say, &#147;Look, I can do this at significantly lower cost than you perhaps have thought would be necessary&#148;, is it then open to the company that has set aside funds for decommissioning and waste disposal to go to the authorities and say, &#147;We don&#146;t think we&#146;re going to need all this.

<p><a name="080624103000013"></a>What is meant by &#147;the full share of costs&#148;? There was a meeting upstairs a month or six weeks ago, addressed by the Minister for Energy, Malcolm Wicks, who had with him a senior official in the department. I raised that question, which had been put to me by one or two of the companies. It has been part of the Government&#146;s proposal that all the costs of dealing with the legacy waste fall to the authorities&#151;that is, to the Government&#151;and huge estimates of those costs have been made so far, while the new-build companies would be required only to bear their share of the additional costs occasioned by the waste that they will produce. Some of them had wondered whether the full share meant that they would have to pay the full share of the total cost or only of the additional cost. On that occasion, and those who were there may remember this, I got different answers, one from the Minister and one from the official. I said after the meeting to Mr Wicks, &#147;I think you&#146;ve got to sort this out before the Bill comes to the Lords, because I shall certainly want to raise the matter there&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080624103000014"></a>As I understand it, and perhaps the Minister will be able to correct me if I am wrong, it is intended that the costs that a new-build company will have to provide for will be the costs of disposing of the waste that it produces and the additional infrastructure costs that that waste would occasion. I do not think there is any intention that the new-build companies should make any other contribution to the total cost of the repository. Perhaps the Minister will have a form of words that can put that beyond doubt; if not, we shall have to return to this at a later stage. There is clearly still some uncertainty out there about what is meant by &#147;the full share&#148;. There was discussion of it in the nuclear White Paper. I shall not bother to read the whole paragraph, but paragraph 2.132 says that some people have,</p>
<ul><a name="080624103000067"></a>&#147;questioned the meaning of the reference to the &#145;full share of costs&#146; in the consultation document&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="080624103000061"></a>The question then was whether that means simply by volume or by the level of radioactivity, which is another issue. I want to be quite certain that the new-build people are not going to be required to bear any of the costs which would fall to the authorities under the legacy programme and that they will be responsible only for the additional costs that their waste will occasion. Another point that arose from the White Paper is that the Government are very keen that they should learn from international experience. Energy<I>Solutions</I> is a good example of a company with international experience in this area and therefore ought to be listened to. The White Paper goes on to the issue of the setting aside of funds. We have heard about the Nuclear Liabilities Financing Assurance Board, also referred to in the White Paper.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000015"></a>I wanted to see what is meant by all this. I do not know if noble Lords have had a chance to look at the consultation paper published last February entitled the <I>Consultation on </I><I>F</I><I>unded </I><I>D</I><I>ecommissioning </I><I>P</I><I>rogramme </I><I>G</I><I>uidance for </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>N</I><I>uclear </I><I>P</I><I>ower </I><I>S</I><I>tations</I>. Apparently, what is envisaged is that the sum required to be provided in this funding has a significant risk premium in order to cover the possibility that the costs may be higher, and that the advantage would be that companies could then be certain that they would not be asked for more if it turned out that in the long run the costs were much higher. However, paragraph 210 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080624103000066"></a>&#147;Should the actual costs of providing the waste disposal service prove lower than expected, these lower costs will not be passed on to nuclear operators&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624103000062"></a>and says by way of reason for this&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080624103000068"></a>&#147;who would have gained from certainty of a fixed price and would not have been exposed to the risk of price escalation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624103000063"></a>I understand the logic, but one has to ask what advantage is it to the industry if someone innovative and with international experience&#151;I quoted a moment ago that the Government want to see&#151;comes along and offers a significantly lower cost for the disposal of waste? There could also be a lower cost for decommissioning so that the sums that have been set aside are in fact higher than will be required. What happens then? Would it not be fairer in those circumstances, so as to encourage competition and the reduction of costs, if the companies that had been asked to make this provision to be monitored by NLFAB actually enjoyed some of the advantage of it?</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000016"></a>My amendment is a peg on which to hang the argument and I do not suggest for a moment that in its present form it could be added to the Bill, but I have raised two questions of substance. First: what is meant by &#147;their share of the costs&#148; and does it include any possible share of the costs of dealing with the legacy waste; and secondly, is it really the case that the government intend that companies which can negotiate with an innovating international company, if I may put it that way, to achieve a substantially lower cost is to derive no benefit at all? I beg to move.</p>

As I recall, the full cost concept does not necessarily mean full cost for ever and a day; rather, it will be subject to redefinition over time. In the context of decommissioning, storage and repository, the financing for legacy waste will have to cover the cost of the repository&#151;that is, the NDA will be responsible for the construction of the waste facility and the storage of the old legacy waste. The waste created as a consequence of the new build will obviously be stored over time. In the initial stages, the cost of storage in the repository will be deemed to be full cost because that will be the original price. However, as time progresses and as the expertise of the decommissioning agent, whichever private company it is, improves, so the marginal cost will diminish. Therefore, in some respects, full cost means initial full cost but over time it will diminish.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000018"></a>I am looking through my mental notes as I speak but my impression is that the companies that run the powers stations&#151;the ones that are in first&#151;will probably have to pay a bit more, and in effect they will probably charge more for their electricity, but as their expertise and experience are developed, so they will benefit from lower costs. Therefore, over the lifetime of this project&#151;I admit that it is a very long lifetime&#151;it is likely that the costs will even out. It is not certain that the new investors in new-build power stations will necessarily be punished in perpetuity because over time the costs will even out.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>

<p><a name="080624103000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, raised questions concerning the company that will carry out the clean-up work, but that will depend on the terms of the contract that the NDA enters into with it. However, I understand that a number of companies&#151;I do not refer just to the one which employs me and to which I give assistance&#151;have said, &#147;We think that, once we get into the operation, we will be able to discover economies. We will be able to change the nature of the work pattern, which may well have stood BNFL in good stead in the past&#148;. Indeed, it could be argued that as BNFL&#146;s functions are being removed and it is being dismantled, it has not been that successful in a number of areas. However, if the new companies are successful&#151;as has been said, some of them have extensive international records of achievement&#151;they may well find that, because of their commercial acumen, they are able to create elbow room, which enables them to take on additional work and derive benefit from that. Frankly, the concept of doing the job for less than had been anticipated is only one part of this. In some respects, doing the job for less money merely liberates resource, which affords opportunities for investment in other matters related to the broader contract, meaning that the work can be done that much more efficiently and quickly. Therefore, there is an element of internal dynamics in the financing of these contracts. It would therefore be unfortunate to concentrate just on the idea that somehow by doing

<p><a name="080624103000021"></a>My understanding is that the economics of decommissioning is still fairly vague, because we do not know what the terms of the contracts will be&#151;indeed, we might never know every dot and comma. Decommissioning and the work that the NDA will be allocating in the next three weeks might well enable the successful company to expand its role, rather than just take the money out, which would be regrettable. We would want the company to be encouraged to do more, rather than just do as much as it is saying. That would be a win-win situation for UK plc, for the companies involved and for the important task of getting rid of the waste.</p>

It would be a strange industry&#151;certainly it would be strange for the nuclear industry which is at the cutting edge of technology&#151;that did not reap advantages over time in terms of technical innovation and improvement. I am grateful to my noble friend for identifying his optimism on that and the expectations of all of us. Our problem with the nuclear industry is that the timescale is always so surpassingly long that, in terms of decisions taken by business, it raises some very fundamental questions indeed. I will attempt to address those fundamental questions. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will see whether I respond adequately to his points.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000025"></a>Clause 45 sets out who can propose a modification and what the proposal can consist of. Modifications to an approved funded decommissioning programme under this clause could include both financial and technical modifications. The persons who can propose modifications are clearly listed: the Secretary of State, the site operator and any other person who has obligations under the programme, provided that the site operator consents to the proposed modification.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000026"></a>The aim of the power is to allow for the principle about which the noble Lord spoke; that is, the modification of a programme after it has been approved. It is obvious that that is necessary; otherwise, we would be in a state of stasis which would ill befit an industry with capacity for significant development. The operator would be expected to propose modifications where a technical or operational change in the station had a significant impact on decommissioning or waste cost estimates. Modifications might need to be made also where there had been a breach in the programme.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000027"></a>It is important to stress that the Secretary of State can exercise his power to make a modification only in order to ensure that the programme continues to make prudent provision for technical matters and the financing of designated technical matters. The clause allows the Secretary of State also to impose new or additional obligations on any body corporate associated with the operator. This might be necessary where the level of security that a body corporate could provide had diminished in some way and there was a requirement for another body corporate associated with the operator to provide that additional security.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000028"></a>The Secretary of State&#146;s power to make modifications or impose obligations is of key importance if a programme is to remain up to date and to ensure that the cost estimates, technical plan and financing arrangements remain prudent. It is also integral to the enforcement and sanction regime. In the event of a breach in the programme, the Secretary of State might choose to modify the programme prior to, or instead of, taking formal enforcement action.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000029"></a>Similar powers in relation to the modification of a decommissioning programme exist elsewhere. We have the experience of the oil and gas industry. The Petroleum Act 1998 gives the Secretary of State a power to revise a programme to decommission offshore oil and gas installations. The provisions of the Energy Act 2004 give the Secretary of State a similar power in relation to decommissioning of offshore renewables installations.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC584"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC584</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000030"></a>I speak by way of broad introduction to the important issues that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, raised with his amendment. As currently drafted, the clause already enables the Secretary of State to increase or decrease the target sum or propose other technical modifications which do not alter the target sum that a fund will be required to meet, provided that it is prudent to do so. Therefore, I do not think that the amendment is necessary. However, the noble Lord is probably less concerned about whether the amendment is necessary than about the issues that he raised with regard to costs, to which I shall come.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000031"></a>I have described the Government&#146;s powers, but it is fair to say that discussion to date has focused on the worst-case scenario, with an underlying assumption that costs will increase. It is arguable that as a Government we are obliged prudently to focus on that scenario. However, the amendment raises the valid question of what would happen if a solution to minimise the amount of waste or reduce the amount of moneys needed to meet the liability came forward.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000032"></a>As I have already said, the clause as drafted allows for modifications that decrease the target sum where it is prudent to approve them. The framework provided by the provisions allows for operators to propose effective ways of dealing with decommissioning and waste management other than those set out in guidance issued by the Government. But that answers only&#151;I hope that the noble Lord will bear with me&#151;the question on approvals for modifying the programme. Any proposal to decommission a nuclear power station and dispose of its waste will also need regulatory approval from, among others, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Environment Agency. Furthermore, any proposal from an operator to reduce their estimates of the costs of decommissioning, waste management and disposal liabilities would need the agreement of those managing the operator&#146;s independent fund. Additionally, any proposal that involves the shipment of waste would need to conform to existing UK policy. Any proposal to decommission a new nuclear power station and to dispose of its wastes will have to conform to existing policy, as will any proposal to accelerate decommissioning. However, I want to emphasise that this approach does not rule out the consideration of alternative or new methods of decommissioning or waste management techniques, the point addressed by my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill in his contribution. It is for this reason that the Government have not taken a prescriptive approach to the technicalities involved in waste and decommissioning in the Bill. The guidance issued under the Bill allows operators to develop and propose innovative decommissioning methods.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asks: where is the gain and therefore the incentive for operators to do this? First, let us deal with the crucial point about the concept of the fixed unit price. The fixed unit price will reflect the most up-to-date estimates of costs available at the time when the price is set, and the level of certainty the Government have on those costs. Consequently, dependent on the date of construction of a new nuclear power station, operators of different stations may be set different fixed unit prices for waste disposal. For example, the fixed unit price for a power station to be constructed in five years&#146; time could be  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC585"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>different from the fixed unit price agreed for a power station to be constructed 10 years hence. The difference may arise because over time it is likely that understanding of the expected costs of the geological disposal facility and associated activities will increase, and therefore at the time the agreement is entered into, the Government could be more comfortable attaching a different risk premium on the fixed unit price.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000034"></a>Of course the Government have a primary duty to safeguard the taxpayer&#146;s position when they are bearing a very substantial risk. The fixed unit price will be set based on estimates of the costs of the geological disposal facility and the level of confidence we have in the cost estimates at the time a company comes forward. Business wants clarity and certainty, and has indicated that it would be prepared to pay a significant risk premium in return for having the certainty of a fixed unit price. It is that which the Government are seeking to respond to. If operators can carry out decommissioning more cheaply than originally envisaged, provided that all the regulatory steps have been taken, any surplus in the fund set aside for decommissioning will be returned to the operators&#151;and there is the gain. A fixed unit price gives a guarantee to the operators of what their maximum costs could be against a background where the price needs to be set to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer, but if techniques and technologies are developed that reduce the costs, the fund set aside for decommissioning can be returned to the operators, who then gain from the position.</p>

But, as I indicated, over time, a power station that is constructed in five years&#146; time might face a different risk cost unit price from one built later. The price is the one against which the station is built and which it recognises is the fixed unit price that it bears throughout its operation. I am merely indicating that the clause does not need the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, but it did need the stimulus of his amendment to provoke this debate, which I hope is clarifying the issues. If those costs can be reduced through improved technology with regard to decommissioning, the power station might find that it gets some return against the improved technology. What it does know is that that is the maximum fixed unit price which it will have to meet. That is the certainty and that is the guarantee.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000037"></a>Of course, it may be that over time the power station can see that it will get additional profits through the advantages of new technology, which reduces the decommissioning cost. But it cannot bank on that. The certainty is the price that it is given when it is constructed. Those costs will differ over time: it is not a fixed price for everybody, but depends on when one is engaging in that operation.

But the intention is clear that when the first nuclear new build occurs, it will be building against a clear fixed cost, which will give certainty.</p>

I am sure that he said that. That is what I understood. But if that is the case, in layman&#146;s terms that is not a fixed-rate mortgage; it is a capped mortgage. They are very different things. Surely, going forward, the funding agency will take a risk. It could turn out that there is not enough. At one time it might think that there is more than enough and at another, five years later, it may turn out that there is not enough. The fund would have to keep a healthy surplus against the possibility in the future that there may not be enough. It may have been underestimated. I would be extremely surprised&#151;I may have heard incorrectly&#151;that a surplus or what I would call a sunk cost in the past would be refunded if a company found that the cost was less than expected.

I am trying to describe things objectively. History shows that things have cost more in that sector. We hope that technology will reduce costs in the future, but if the costs increase, which has been the whole history of this industry, the taxpayer will make up the difference, but if costs decrease, the companies get their money back. That cannot be good. It is certainly not good for the taxpayer. I also emphasise the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, about whether this is in fixed monetary terms or related to something. Presumably it is not related to the retail price index, which would be quite inappropriate in this instance.</p>

Perhaps I may make the position clear. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, the initial risk relating to waste disposal is borne by the taxpayer. There is a substantial element of the Government taking the risk for the construction of the facility and guaranteeing the security of the waste disposal. The industry will benefit from knowing what that cost is and for each new nuclear build it will know what the fixed costs are for waste disposal. I have no doubt that the industry will say that the Government are putting that cost at a high level, whereas the industry would obviously like it to be as low as possible.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000042"></a>The Government&#146;s view is clear. The risk is being borne by the taxpayer for this crucial construction and the Government intend that the price will be fixed to guarantee that the taxpayer is not faced with increased costs that the Government have not bargained for. Therefore, the fixed-price cost for the nuclear power station, when constructed, will certainly be guaranteed but it will assuredly be high. However, that cost may come down for successive builds as technical developments in waste management accrue to the industry. Therefore, the fixed cost for subsequent power stations may go down due to technical developments but there is no guarantee of that; the cost may go up. It will not go up for those who have already contracted at the fixed price, because that is the concept of the fixed price, but the level of the fixed price may go up if the burdens on government and the taxpayer substantially increase due to an increase in the costs of waste disposal.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000043"></a>We cannot foresee which way the costs will move, although of course we share the optimism of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated that enterprising companies may well reduce the development costs of power stations. If they do, the fixed cost will come down for future build. I do not have a detailed answer on the fixed cost&#151;I do not think that that would be expected of me&#151;but at the end of this year we will publish the methodology of establishing a fixed unit price for the disposal of intermediate-level waste and spent fuel. Whether the retail prices index will be regarded as the best measure for indexing, I do not know; nor do I know how many years will be involved. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is absolutely right: we are talking about an industry with a waste problem, the lifespan of which is beyond the range of analysis in those terms; that will have to be built into the methodology. However, that is the kind of problem with which Governments have to wrestle.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000044"></a>This industry knows that the one feature that it has which is unique&#151;I hesitate to use that word because someone can always think of another example&#151;or close to being unique, is that its waste product has a timeless concept which requires a particular form of disposal. That involves substantial costs and is critical to the community&#146;s security, and that is why inevitably the Government become crucially involved.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000045"></a>I was going also to help the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on one of his discrete points. If the Committee will allow me, I shall deal with that before withstanding the rain storm of further questions that will no doubt follow my inadequate replies.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked how the share of the funding for decommissioning and waste disposal is calculated. Operators must pay their full share of waste management and disposal costs, and are obliged to set aside sufficient funds over the life of the station to enable them to meet these costs as they fall due, as for decommissioning. &#147;Full share&#148; reflects the fact that the Government&#146;s view is that waste from new build can and should be disposed of in the same geological disposal facility as legacy waste, to which we are approaching a solution. This means that some of the costs of building the geological disposal facility will rightly be for the Government, because they are  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC588"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the legacy costs of an industry that we have sustained during the past four or five decades. The cost of disposal of legacy waste is inevitably for the Government and the public to bear. However, we wish to ensure that operators of new nuclear power stations make the right contributions to the cost of the disposal facility for their waste. That is the concept of their full share. It will be governed by the fixed price. I accept that there is interest in how the calculation of that fixed price will be arrived at. I cannot define the methodology. The department recognises fully that the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will not be answered until that methodology has been identified and everyone can see how the calculations will be made. But that will have to wait for another day and rather more expert exposition than I can offer.</p>

The Minister has done his best, but I shall two make points before I withdraw the amendment. First, he said that we will not know what is meant by the &#147;full share&#148; until it is finally clarified by the department. I will study his speech with great care between now and Report, but one would have to be a bit of an optimist to believe that he has answered that question effectively. We will wait till a later stage, perhaps well after the Bill has become law, to know precisely what is meant by that.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000048"></a>My second point has been followed up by a number of noble Lords. It is the question whether any of the excess or surplus&#151;I quote the Minister&#146;s words&#151;&#147;would be returned to the operators&#148;. Paragraph 2.10 of the document that I quoted in my opening speech, <I>Consultation on Funded Decommissioning Programme Guidance for New Nuclear Power Stations</I>, made it quite clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="080624103000069"></a>&#147;these lower costs will not be passed on to nuclear operators&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80624-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080624103000049"></a>We got confused at one point because, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, rightly said, this is a dynamic process, there will be successive nuclear power stations and the unit costs will not be the same for all. I am asking about the initial tranche&#151;I do not know how many there will be&#151;one, two, three or whatever. They will have a unit cost set and, over the life of the station, that may well turn out to be more than is necessary to deal with decommissioning and waste. Will they get any of that back, or will only future nuclear power stations will benefit from a lower unit cost? There must be an answer to that question. I will carry on for as long as is necessary for the Minister to consult his oracles.</p>

The industry will know the unit price that it is facing, fixed cost, for the disposal of its waste.

It will be different for power stations according to when they are constructed. It may go up;

<p><a name="080624103000053"></a>As the noble Lord will recognise, the decommissioning of power stations is an ongoing programme. By 2035, we will have decommissioned all the power stations built in the 20th century. This is an ongoing problem. Over the next 10 years, all but one of the existing nuclear power stations will be shut down, but we have not yet shut any down completely; they are shut down, but they are not yet fully decommissioned. Over the next 25 years, and in the years since the process has been begun, we are seeing and will see the decommissioning of the nuclear power stations built in the 20th century. They raise all sorts of issues of cost and safety, but not safety in terms of the locality. I do not think that anxiety is expressed about the decommissioning process. The noble Lord may want to contradict me on that, but I merely say to him that there would be no question of new nuclear build if we were not entirely confident of the fact that we can decommission the 25 stations that we must by 2035 because their useful life is over.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000011"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 50 and 52. They have been grouped as they all relate to the definition of security for decommissioning nuclear power stations, offshore renewable energy installations and offshore oil and gas installations and the protection of that security in the event of insolvency. Clauses 53, 67 and 71 respectively aim to ensure that moneys set aside for decommissioning by way of security cannot be accessed by creditors in the event of a company becoming insolvent.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000012"></a>The provisions do that by disapplying the relevant insolvency legislation. That ensures that moneys set aside for decommissioning will be restricted or prevented from being used for anything other than their intended purpose of fulfilling decommissioning objectives and obligations, even if the company with those objectives and obligations becomes insolvent.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000013"></a>If we did not have those provisions and a company with decommissioning obligations became insolvent, it might be possible for creditors to access moneys set aside for decommissioning. That could mean that insufficient moneys remained to pay for the full cost of decommissioning and, in the case of new nuclear, the operator&#146;s full share of waste management costs.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000014"></a>The amendments clarify the meaning of the term &#147;security&#148; as used in relation to those provisions. To take each amendment in turn, Amendment No. 46  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC591"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relates to the decommissioning and clean-up of new nuclear sites. As Clause 53 is drafted, there is a risk that if an operator was to become insolvent the courts could construe the term &#147;security&#148; by reference to the narrow legal nature of any arrangements in place, rather than their broader economic effect. For example, if a performance bond was provided as security for decommissioning funds, a court might determine that this would not amount to a security, and therefore in the event of insolvency the bond could be accessed for creditors for purposes other than decommissioning. In such a situation there would be a high risk that the taxpayer would have to meet any resultant shortfall in decommissioning funds. That could put funds set aside for decommissioning at risk as they would not then fall within the protection from insolvency provided by in the clause.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000015"></a>Through amendment, the Government want to ensure that operators have access to a full range of instruments which, if acceptable to the Secretary of State, might be put forward as part of the programme. That could include instruments that do not yet exist but might be developed as the market matures.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000016"></a>Amendment No. 50 amends the offshore renewables provisions in Clause 67. Like Clause 53 for nuclear, Clause 67 provides protection against insolvency. The Energy Act 2004 defines security in relation to decommissioning programmes for renewable energy installations. This amendment amends the definition given in the Energy Act 2004 to include an insurance policy within that definition. This brings the definition of security in offshore renewables into line with the regimes for nuclear and oil and gas, and ensures a consistent regime. Amendment No. 52 relates to oil and gas installations. It replicates the previous nuclear amendment so that insolvency protection under Clause 71 has a consistent definition of security.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000017"></a>I hope that the Committee acknowledges the importance of ensuring that funds set aside for decommissioning are available for the purpose for which they are set aside, even in the event of a company becoming insolvent. We also hope that it is accepted that these amendments should be supported, because they strengthen the protections for the taxpayer by providing greater clarity to the courts of the definition of a security. The amendments also ensure that we have consistency of protection for decommissioning funds across the three regimes. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080624119000021"></a>Clause 53(4) states that, for the purposes of subsection (3), no regard is to be had to the Insolvency Act and the Northern Ireland equivalent to the extent that it would prevent or restrict the protected assets being applied as necessary to cover the cost of decommissioning. Is this the right way of doing that? Whether or not regard is so paid, if we get to a point at which the site operator becomes insolvent, it is too late&#151;the horse has bolted. I would go further: this must not be dependent on whether the company goes bust. The security set-aside must remain set aside, completely independent of the solvency of the site operator. Perhaps the noble Lord can help me.</p>

I was wondering, when I turned the page, whether (f) would be lottery tickets and (g) sub-prime mortgage special instruments. It is a strange list which raises a number of questions, one of which is fundamental and comes back, in a way, to what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said. If there is a fixed payment, such as that which we ascertained in the previous amendment, and if the operators know that it has to pay it&#151;it is related, I presume, to something like a production unit&#151;I would have thought that it would be much easier to transfer the money into another body that is nothing to do with the business. Maybe I have misunderstood this. Why does the fund remain within the potential legal circumference of the operator? Under the simplified payment system that the Minister outlined earlier on, there seems to be no reason why it should remain there at all. The problem disappears because the money is held elsewhere. We do not want it go to the Treasury because we all know that it would then disappear and our sons, daughters and grandchildren would all miss it. There must be some way of holding the money, just like money is held in sovereign funds elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000023"></a>More seriously, we have a list of assets here, but is it specified what assets these operators are allowed to invest in and where they can be held? Do they have to be held in the United Kingdom? It is fine to talk about UK insolvency law, but what if it is an international business? I presume that a lot of these funds could potentially be held elsewhere. These organisations are subject to all sorts of international and multinational legal requirements regarding creditors in other jurisdictions, which we have absolutely no control over.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000024"></a>If there are these different assets, how do we judge their value? Are we going to get ourselves into some sort of pension fund problem in terms of the value of the assets that the businesses hold in the various ways that they might hold them? If the markets move down or if certain other market changes happen, are we going to have annual valuations of these funds that then have to be made up over time? We are talking about such large amounts of money that this could have big effects in the area that we are talking about. I take the Minister&#146;s point that the Government, and we as an economy, already have the experience of the offshore petroleum industry, but I am sure, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, would say, that those amounts themselves are high.

We were concerned, insolvency law being what it was, that unless it was set out clearly, there would be a danger that money in the fund itself could be seized or might legally belong to the creditors of that company.

The Secretary of State would expect the funding arrangement plan to include something called a statement of investment principles, an SIP, which sets out the fund&#146;s investment policy, designed to ensure that the money that the fund receives from the operator will be appropriately invested to generate the funds necessary to meet the operator&#146;s liabilities when they fall due. As a minimum, before the Secretary of State would agree to a fund being set up, he would expect the SIP to include the fund&#146;s investment objectives, the attitude to risk and how risk is defined, the asset allocation strategy, the decision-making authorities, performance measurement criteria, benchmarks, the policy on realising investments, the policy on exercising rights, the policy on the extent to which social, environmental and ethical considerations are taken into account, the mandates to all advisers and reporting requirements. Those, among others things, would be expected under statement of investment principles. Those are the circumstances under which we bring forward these amendments to deal with the situation, which may or may not arise, of a company going bust and creditors wanting to seize all possible assets.</p>

<p><a name="080624119000028"></a>I shall need more advice on the international point raised by the noble Lord. It is an important question and I should welcome the opportunity to write to him and to other Members of the Committee with a response. As I understand it, we are setting up funds of this type for UK energy here, as opposed to elsewhere. The noble Lord made the point about globalisation very well, but whether or not the company has assets in other parts of the world, what is left in the fund is, as Clause 42 sets out, specifically for nuclear and other plants in this country. That money is protected from the danger of insolvency, thus, it is hoped, saving the taxpayer what could be a very large bill.</p>

The fund is set up under this scheme in order to deal with the costs of getting rid of waste material and of achieving decommissioning. Clearly, lawyers thought that there was a danger that the fund might be liable in cases of insolvency. Obviously, we like the scheme that we are setting up and, from the general consensus in the Committee, it seems that noble Lords like it too. We think that changing the way in which the fund is operated would be rather a far step to take when, as we are doing here, we can easily change the position regarding insolvency.</p>

If you want to de-risk the decommissioning fund, which is a key thing that we all want to do, the easiest way to do so is to take it out of the legal circumference of the operator altogether, and that can be done by paying cash to whichever fund it goes into at the time on a per kilowatt hour basis, an operational time basis or whatever the basis needs to be. That would solve the whole problem and taxpayers would have certainty. It would mean that the public sector had to manage the fund but I am sure that it could delegate that as effectively as an energy operator&#151;it is not the core business of either the public sector or energy operators. I do not understand why that is not seen as a straightforward solution. Certainly, as a taxpayer, I would feel far better about that solution than I would about trying to put national laws around international operators. It seems a simple principle to me.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080624119000101"></a> Clause 54, page 47, line 27, leave out &#147;2&#148; and insert &#147;5&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000037"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 54 concerns the rules that govern decommissioning and waste handling programmes. There could scarcely be a more serious issue, and the most robust measures need to be in place to ensure that the whole process of decommissioning is handled in the safest possible manner. This is why we feel that there should be stringent penalties for anyone who breaks the laws concerning decommissioning and nuclear waste. The penalties should reflect the seriousness of such an offence.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC595"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC595</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000038"></a>Amendment No. 48 would increase the maximum prison sentence from two to five years. Breaking the laws on nuclear decommissioning would not only put the safety of the community at severe risk but would represent a breach of trust in terms of the assurances concerning the proper handling of disposal. We feel that two years is simply not stringent enough. Considering the degree of risk, we feel that five years is more appropriate, while admitting that it is a subjective judgment.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000039"></a>Amendment No. 49 in the group concerns those who might have provided false information to the Secretary of State. Anyone who intentionally gives misleading information should be subject to the full might of the law. However, we propose to omit the word &#147;misleading&#148; to avoid the chance of someone being prosecuted for unwittingly providing misleading information. The term is subjective. Misleading information can be provided knowingly, negligently or innocently. The latter, we feel, should be free from prosecution. The wording of the clause, if amended in this way, would still be absolutely clear that anyone who knowingly or recklessly supplies false information to the Secretary of State in response to a requirement under this chapter would be committing an offence. It would leave no room for manoeuvre. It would be sad indeed if someone was locked up for providing information that was deemed misleading by a court when they had absolutely no intention of misleading the Secretary of State. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080624119000040"></a><a name="80624-gc0005.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0005.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="080624119000123"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I agree with the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, about the increase from two to five years. However, it would usually be a corporate body that would fall foul of these rules rather than an individual, so I am not sure how it would relate to such a body. I presume that normally this would relate to paragraph (a), which imposes a fine, and I want to ask the Minister as a point of information what the maximum fine would be. We are talking about major implications both monetarily and in terms of the large size of the industry. What sort of maximum level of fine might there be in relation to the major sums we are talking about?</p>

<p><a name="080624119000041"></a><a name="80624-gc0005.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0005.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="080624119000124"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank both noble Lords. Clause 54 makes it a criminal offence for an operator or a person with obligations under an approved programme not to comply with the programme unless they prove that they exercised due diligence to avoid committing the offence. Failing to comply could in extreme circumstances result in the taxpayer being called on to meet the costs of decommissioning and therefore in our view warrants the use of criminal sanctions. No one seems to have disputed that.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000042"></a>Is it right that the two-year maximum period should be increased to five years? The message we want to send is that where there is a breach, the operator will have to demonstrate that they did everything they could to avoid committing that breach. We think that this is what the clause as drafted achieves, and we believe that two years maximum is an appropriate penalty with a sufficient deterrent effect. We do not think that increasing the maximum sentence to five  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC596"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years&#151;basically, just for the sake of it&#151;would materially change the deterrent effect of these provisions. Instead, it is the existence in the first place of the potential for imprisonment itself that is likely to influence the behaviour of individuals with obligations under a decommissioning programme. The penalty is consistent with the penalty regimes for offshore renewables and oil and gas installations decommissioning. If we are to alter that to make it inconsistent with those other regimes, we ought to have good reason for doing so.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000043"></a>The criminal offences in this chapter have been created only for the most serious infringements that could undermine the effectiveness of the structure as a whole. In order to do that, my department sought the advice of the Ministry of Justice in relation to the creation of the new criminal sanction. Its experts were content that the proposed two-year imprisonment term was appropriate.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000044"></a>It is important to remember that the Bill encompasses civil sanctions as well as criminal offences. The Secretary of State may seek a court order to compel a person to provide him with information about the programme under Clause 50 of the Bill. It is true that there are higher penalties in other areas of legislation, such as Section 2(2) of the Nuclear Installations Act, which creates a maximum penalty of five years&#146; imprisonment for enriching uranium or extracting uranium or plutonium from spent fuel without the relevant licence, and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, which set the criminal sanctions for breaches of certain nuclear matters where the offence could put public health at risk. We do not think that they are on all fours with this.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000045"></a>The deterrent effect of Clause 54 of the Bill, however, is to ensure that the operator puts money aside to pay for the full costs of decommissioning and the full share of waste management costs. The Government believes that this framework creates the necessary powers to ensure that funds are accrued to meet those costs, and that any offence should be consistent with the overall purpose and aims of this legislation.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000046"></a>I shall explain how we see the sanctions process operating. Where there is a failure to comply, it is our intention that where time permits, or where the gravity of the breach is not too severe, the Secretary of State would seek to enter into discussions with the operator in order to understand why and how the breach occurred and see if informally it could be put right. In normal circumstances we would seek recourse through the provisions in the Bill to correct the breach only after we had failed to do so using these methods. I think the Committee would be broadly in favour of that approach.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000047"></a>Where the breach is more serious or significant, however, or where informal agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of State may seek to impose a direction under Clause 55. In other words, a failure to comply with a programme would not necessarily result in the immediate initiation of criminal proceedings. It is also likely that in practice, before beginning criminal proceedings, the Secretary of State would, among other things, consider whether or not it was in the public interest to prosecute. However, that does not prevent the Secretary of State from commencing a prosecution without first imposing a direction to remedy

The clauses as drafted provide the Secretary of State with the flexibility to respond to a variety of situations. We think that this flexibility is an important part of the procedure and of ensuring that programmes are adhered to.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000048"></a>Amendment No. 49 seeks to remove the term &#147;misleading&#148; from Clause 57. Again, we are unable to support the amendment; frankly, it would undermine the deterrent effect of the provisions as currently drafted. &#147;Misleading information&#148; can be taken to mean information that a person knowingly or recklessly includes in, or omits from, the material submitted to the Secretary of State. That would mean that the information or material misled, or did not provide an accurate or full picture to, the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000049"></a>The Government believe that the proposed amendment is much too wide and would mean that it would be acceptable for an operator to submit information that was not necessarily false, but perhaps did not provide the full picture&#151;and I suggest that it is that full picture that is important to the general public&#151;about a particular issue. For example, that could result in the submission of information that deliberately provides an incomplete picture, such as including information about investments that are performing well but omits to mention other factors&#151;changes in discount or interest rates&#151;that may negate these gains.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000050"></a>In our mind, the act of &#147;misleading&#148; is a deliberate act and not the result of a clerical error. Of course there would be discretion, as there always is in these cases, for the prosecuting authorities. To put it in a nutshell, we are convinced that the public would not feel comfortable for a Minister to say that it was acceptable for a person knowingly or recklessly to submit misleading information without facing any sanction. Therefore, we think that the amendment would undermine one of the foundations of the regime, which is that the Secretary of State must be able to take decisions on the basis of full and accurate information. It is best that companies should know that from the start.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000051"></a>We hope that Clauses 54 and 57, to which the amendments apply, send a clear message to operators about what is and is not acceptable behaviour. On that basis, we cannot accept either amendment.</p>

The problem that had been identified and which the Government sought to address in the amendment, which is currently subsection (7), was how one defined a &#147;beneficial interest&#148; in an installation that was being decommissioned. As noble Lords will know, many of the original licences go back to the very beginning of the exploration and exploitation of our North Sea oil and gas reserves. The interests of the companies and persons named on many of those original licences have now long gone. However, because no one has updated or amended the licences to exclude those who no longer have beneficial interests in them, the question arises of whether those companies or persons will be caught by the decommissioning processes.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000075"></a>As a result of representations made by the industry and the debate that took place in Committee in the other place, it was agreed to define &#147;beneficial interest&#148; and to exclude those companies that might have originally been named on a licence but which hold no interest of any kind and derive no benefit from it today. That was the origin of subsection (7) and the amendment produced by the Government. However, when the industry saw the proposed subsection, it felt that it did not fully meet its concerns in defining someone with a beneficial interest. For example, does the concept of &#147;beneficial interest&#148; catch companies that only transport production from another installation across or around the installation that is being decommissioned? Would it catch companies and persons whose only interest would be in the purchase of cargos of production from the decommissioning installations? It was appreciated that the Government had responded to the representations of the industry, but it was felt that the subsection did not fully cover all the concerns and issues. As a result, discussions took place between Ministers and Members of Parliament, including Mr John Robertson, who had spoken in Committee in the other place, and it was indicated that either an amendment or clarification of what was meant by &#147;beneficial interest&#148; would be brought forward to meet concerns expressed about the deficiency in subsection (7). I understand that there was a high degree of agreement and that it was hoped that the

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000076"></a>Unfortunately, the truncated programming of Bills in the other place&#151;it is a long time since my days there&#151;meant that although the amendment was tabled it was never debated. Therefore, assurances of the kind that I think Ministers and officials had given the industry never materialised. I therefore take this opportunity to seek that assurance and clarification of what is meant and not meant in subsection (7) in the way that I have suggested.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000077"></a>Ministers have gone a considerable distance already to try to offer that assurance. I have a copy of the letter that Minister Malcolm Wicks sent to Mr John Robertson a little while ago, answering the concerns of the industry. I shall quote directly from it, because it makes it clear that there is no disagreement between government and the industry on this issue. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080624119000105"></a>&#147;I would like, therefore, to make clear that the benefit must arise from the exploitation or exploration of mineral resources or storage or recovery of gas from the installation in question. That would not include persons who are only transporting production from another installation via the installation in question&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080624119000097"></a>that is, the installation that is to be decommissioned&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080624119000108"></a>&#147;nor persons who only buy oil or gas produced from the installation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080624119000098"></a>It was exactly that kind of clarification and assurance that the industry was seeking, and it was certainly given in the letter.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000078"></a>However, will the Minister go a little further and say that he will look at whether subsection (7) should not be amended further to put it beyond doubt that it will not catch people or persons who are using the installations for peripheral reasons? If he cannot, perhaps he can give the other assurance that has been sought: that the guidelines accompanying the Bill will make it absolutely clear that what was written in the letter from the Minister to Mr Robertson MP applies.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000079"></a>Perhaps I may speak briefly to the amendment that prompted this debate. I have been around long enough to know that substituting &#147;shall&#148; for &#147;may&#148; is the most common form of amendment. I have done it many times, as have many others whom I know. However, there is as good a case for doing so in this subsection as anywhere else, because the Government are saying loudly and clearly to the industry that they will not give notices in relation to the types of company or people in question and make them liable. That is what the subsection is for. Therefore, why not insert &#147;shall&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148;? I beg to move.</p>

I was hoping to address the concerns of my noble friend with some clear definitions, and I hope helpfully. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has broadened the debate by asking me to explain the clause, which is a rather more daunting prospect. I shall give some context to the issue because my noble friend has followed the argument in the other place with more diligence than perhaps other Members of the Committee have been able to. He has alighted on a specific point to which I want to respond constructively. As he indicated, the Government had every intention of responding constructively when the Bill was considered in another place. However, I am not as critical as he is about the processes that have developed since he and I were last there. Suffice it to say that on this occasion, it was not possible to make quite the full response he seeks, and I hope to do that for the benefit of the Committee today.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000082"></a>The obvious point is that the UK has benefited from our reserves of oil and gas from the North Sea for many decades, and it has been necessary to update the provisions that apply to the obligations of the contractors. Part IV of the Petroleum Act 1998 consolidated provisions in the 1987 Act, and in this Bill we seek to bring up to date Part IV of the 1998 Act in order to meet the existing abandonment regime which, as my noble friend said, has different structures from the companies. The original structures were clear. Large multinationals with huge resources at their disposal carried out the initial exploration and exploitation, but as the industry developed it has become more sophisticated and the companies now involved are much smaller. The question of who bears the burden, therefore, has to be defined and updated with greater accuracy.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000083"></a>First, the clause extends the list of persons who may be required to provide a decommissioning programme upon receipt of a Section 29 notice under the Petroleum Act 1998. This list will include licensees which have transferred their rights to another company without the consent of the Secretary of State. Companies should not be able to avoid their decommissioning liabilities by such unconsented action, so this is an attempt to ensure that, despite changes that may have taken place in recent years regarding where decommissioning liabilities should rest, they will continue to do so.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000084"></a>Secondly, the clause clarifies the Petroleum Act provisions so that it is clear that they apply to limited liability partnerships in the same way as they apply to limited companies. This includes the provisions for making associates such as parent companies responsible for decommissioning where there are concerns about the financial strength of a company. I am sure that noble Lords will recognise the importance and significance of ensuring that we are able to put responsibility where it lies; that is, with the organisation that is able to meet its obligations.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000085"></a>Thirdly, the clause will ensure that all those involved in a development share the decommissioning obligation from the same time. The wording of the current legislation means that the operator can be made responsible for  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC602"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC602</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decommissioning when construction of the platform starts, but his fellow licensees cannot be made responsible until one of the activities specified in the Act has commenced; for example, production. That may leave a significant period when the liability rests on a single company, which is not equitable.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000086"></a>Finally, the clause will prevent the Secretary of State from placing a decommissioning obligation on a licensee or a party to a joint operating agreement if that licensee or party is not entitled to derive, and never has been entitled to derive, any benefit from the installation. Consequential changes for associate companies of licensees are also included to reflect this change. The point is, as I indicated, that over the years, oil and gas companies have created a patchwork of commercial arrangements by splitting licensed areas into sub-areas. As a result, some companies which have received no benefit at all from a particular commercial sub-area are still a party to the licence that covers that sub-area. It is not right that they should bear that responsibility.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000087"></a>I now come to a point that I hope my noble friend will recognise is especially helpful. The wording of Section 30 of the Petroleum Act 1998 brings all the companies on the licence for a given area into the scope of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to make them responsible for decommissioning an installation in any part of that licensed area. Naturally, companies which have never been entitled to derive any benefit from an installation are reluctant to carry a liability for its decommissioning. In our discussions on the clause with companies that might be affected, it was clear that there could sometimes be doubt about whether a company would be seen as being entitled to derive a benefit from an installation.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000088"></a>My noble friend is asking us to define who does not receive the benefit and therefore ought not to fall within the range of liability, so I want to make it clear that the entitlement to a benefit must arise from the exploitation or exploration of mineral resources or storage or recovery of gas from the installation in question. We do not regard that as including persons who are only transporting production from another installation via the installation in question, nor persons who only buy oil or gas produced from the installation. It would also not include persons whose only benefit is derived from trading the installation&#146;s carbon dioxide allowances or from the supply of goods or services to the installation. We intend to consult the companies concerned further on this issue and will publish revised guidance notes on the department&#146;s website, but I hope that my noble friend will recognise that he was seeking what the Government intend to happen. We will, of course, issue guidance after consultation.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080624119000089"></a>I hope that the explanations that I have given assure the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, of the virtues of the clause in general and particularly on the position of companies which have never derived a benefit from an installation, which was the burden of my noble friend&#146;s anxiety. Changing the wording from &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148; would not alter the way that the clause limits the Secretary of State's powers, so it is not necessary. I hope he will recognise that we intend to meet the anxieties that he expressed when moving the amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000011"></a>We come to the odorous subject of biomethane&#151;that is one of the issues in the plot of &#147;The Archers&#148;. It is a serious issue and it is unfortunate that it has not been dealt with in the Bill, because it needs to be dealt with quickly, as it will be a major component of many aspects of waste recycling and our use of waste and landfill in the future. The purpose of the amendment is simple, although many noble Lords, when they read an amendment, ask, &#147;Does it actually do what you think it does?&#148; because of the language it is dressed up in. The purpose of the amendment is that biomethane should attract renewable obligation credits. Why is this important? We are looking at a very important future source of energy; however, to kickstart that energy, we have to find a way for biomethane to be injected into the grid and for its economics to work.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000012"></a>Where does biomethane come from? It comes from three main sources: anaerobic digestion plants, manure&#151;a number of farm plants deal exclusively with farm manure&#151;and landfill sites. The importance of taking biomethane from those sites relates not just to the energy that it can produce but also to the fact that, left to rot on its own, it will escape to the atmosphere. It is a major greenhouse gas and causes problems associated with greenhouse gases. Biomethane can be dealt with by being extracted and purified, and the CO2 can be taken out of the system. The methane is not released directly to the atmosphere, but will be converted into carbon dioxide. It is not a great solution, because of the problems associated with carbon dioxide, but it is a great deal better than releasing methane into the atmosphere.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000013"></a>Can we describe biomethane as &#147;renewable&#148;? That is another issue that has to be looked at. I would argue that it is one of the major renewables, especially if it comes from manure. I have had many arguments in the context of agriculture about greenhouse emissions from the methane produced by cows and sheep. One of the major problems, which is interesting, is that it is difficult to tell what those emissions would be, unless you attached a bag to both ends of the animal. That would mean that you would end up with a dead cow or sheep, but you would know what the biomethane output was. I raise that only because the climate-change ambassador for New Zealand and I had lunch. I was surprised to hear that New Zealand claims that it has less flatulent sheep than we have here. I find that very hard to accept, because its criteria are based on the intensive rearing of sheep which means that there is a higher methane output. In Northumberland, where there is at worst one sheep in every two acres, that is not the case at all. However, we still have the problem of the methane, and biomethane removes that.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000014"></a>As a renewable, biomethane has major benefits because it is very energy-efficient, especially if it is added to a CHP plant. We will be coming on to combined heat and power, which makes the use of any gas far more efficient. One problem, however, is that these processes, as has been expressed in &#147;The Archers&#148;,  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC605"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column GC605</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are quite odorous in their nature, so you do not want to stick the plants close to tower blocks where a district heat system could be used. You might win on one side but lose the support of many of the residents in another aspect.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000015"></a>Much of the methane is losing out on its major benefit through CHP because it would have to be transported from site and therefore injected into the gas grid. This is the important aspect of the Bill. The attraction of renewable obligation credits is that they would allow biomethane to be injected into the localised grid, over and above being dealt with by local energy electricity generation&#151;or, as in the case of landfill, which is a major problem, by sometimes being flared off directly into the atmosphere. The latter has been banned on offshore oil and gas rigs, and it seems incredible that we allow it to take place on landfill sites, which are a direct result of human activity.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000016"></a>We need to look at the benefits of what is happening in other parts of the world. Within Europe, it has been estimated that if the sustainable production of biomethane were optimised at 500 billion metric cubic whatever it is&#151;I love it when they give you a briefing and you have no idea what the unit you are measuring represents. I apologise; I have just realised that they have a different measuring system in my notes. The calculation is that optimisation would result in a reduction of 15 per cent of Europe&#146;s CO2 emissions.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000017"></a>Although I have a number of examples from within Europe, the scale of this should be looked at with regard to the situation in America. Huckaby Ridge in Stephenville, Texas, claims to be the largest biogas production facility in the world with an output of approximately 650,000&#151;whatever it is you measure biogas in&#151;which is the equivalent of 1 billion cubic feet. That is the energy equivalent of more than 4.6 million gallons of heating oil, and it uses the manure of 10,000 dairy cows and waste from the agriculture industry. That is important; if the manure were not being treated in that way then that methane would be released into the atmosphere. It is such a successful scheme that they are looking to introduce it in other, vast areas.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000018"></a>I find it incredible that, with the industries we have in this country such as the dairy industry, where so many farmers could benefit from that scheme as an added source of income, we are not looking at adopting it. It might cause a problem for the renewable obligations credits but would have massive benefits, not only for the country but in our fight against climate change. I beg to move.</p>

I am interested that he has limited his amendment to biomethane, because, presumably, the same problems and opportunities arise on the question of naturally produced methane.

Perhaps that should be considered further in the amendment.</p>

Those are not discrete pockets of methane lying there to be tapped but are the result of biological activity on the environmental coal faces. Here we have a considerable potential source of energy that, at the moment in this country, is hardly being tapped.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000021"></a>To compare that with the position in Germany, the Germans have for some years given significant support to their coal mine methane industry, with the result that firms have invested substantially. I do not have a figure, but I have always been told that that is making a significant addition to the energy requirements of that country. This is not a carbon-free source; on the contrary, it is clearly carbon; but at the same time, it is a source of energy. It is a source that in effect utilises the coal without the deleterious consequences of burning the coal which, as we discussed the other day, until we have a proper economic carbon capture and storage process, gives rise to substantial emissions.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000022"></a>Why are the Government so chary of giving support to what is at the moment in this country a fledgling coal mine methane industry? I have pursued this on an all-party basis with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and other noble Lords who, sadly, are no longer with us. We got enormous encouragement from Mr Michael Meacher, who was then the Minister&#151;not at Defra. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, will put me right. He was not shouted down, because they do not do that, but the civil servants sitting with him made it absolutely clear that there was no way that he could be allowed to support the coal mine methane industry in this country. We should be able to have an effective coal line methane industry. If not, why not?</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000023"></a>My only other point, following up the points made by my noble friend, is that when the Liverpool Garden Festival site was prepared, it was on the site known in Liverpool as the Cassy, otherwise the cast iron shore. It had been the dumping ground for waste of all kinds over centuries. When it was covered up to build the Liverpool Garden Festival on top of it, the methane generated by that waste was sufficient to provide a supply for 20 years.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000024"></a>I am sure that the same happens elsewhere in the country, but the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, is right to say that methane could be an important addition to our armoury of energy sources&#151;one which would be significantly less damaging than burning coal and which could, I believe, make a significant contribution to our well-being. I should like an answer from the Minister to the following question. If he cannot give it today, perhaps he will be kind enough to write to me. Why cannot the Government provide the same sort of support to the coal mine methane industry in this country that the German Government have given to their industry in that country?</p>

It is unfortunate that methane is flared off, but we have to bear in mind that methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2&#151;depending on the circumstances, somewhere between 20 and 60 times more potent. Therefore, if there is no way of using it locally, it is much better for the methane to be flared off rather than allow it to escape directly into the atmosphere. However, at root I agree completely with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000026"></a>It is sensible to trap coal bed methane&#151;biomethane&#151;not only for environmental reasons but also because it is a valuable source of power. The thing about coal bed methane is that it continuously seeps into the atmosphere in a diffuse way. If we were to take steps to trap it and pipe it up from underground, we would get a double benefit by reducing the national greenhouse gas burden and acquiring an extra source of energy. I hope very much that something can be done in this general direction.</p>

He is absolutely right that there was some deep resistance, particularly in what is now my noble friend&#146;s department, to what seemed to me to be a very sensible proposition. I support the biomethane approach outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, but the Government need to look again at the broader issue of methane. A number of prejudices seem to have been overcome in government departments in relation to renewable and low-carbon energy, but some remain. Like the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, at that meeting I was completely bamboozled as to why the officials advising us took such a strong line. I do not expect my noble friend to respond today but perhaps he will make a few inquiries.</p>

The amendment talks about how to deal with the renewables obligation and biomethane, and it does not actually exclude coal-based methane. In fact, it could be described as biomethane. I just did not mention it, which perhaps I should have done.</p>

<p><a name="080624120000029"></a><a name="80624-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080624120000096"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> This has been an interesting discussion. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, spoke at length about biomethane from manure, which surprised me slightly because if you do not return manure to the soil, you have to use artificial manure. On the farm where I live, all the manure is returned to the soil. I know that dairy farmers have to get rid of a great deal of slurry, but it is strange to hear the Liberal Democrats, who are so green, suggest that manure should not be returned to the soil but be turned into biomethane.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000030"></a>The uses for manure are rather limited. The noble Lord confused us by talking about flatulent sheep in New Zealand. That is a different issue and concerns how methane gets into the atmosphere. We have a responsibility to try to alter what cattle eat so that less methane is released into the atmosphere, but that is a different point.</p>

I have some historic link to the programme but I shall not complete my submission before the programme is over this evening, so I cannot adopt the novel suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on how I should reply to the debate.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000033"></a>I am also reeling from the shock of my noble friend Lord Whitty suggesting that departments harbour prejudices. Informed judgment, which may differ from the one that he follows is one thing, but the idea that departments harbour prejudices is deeply shocking, and I hope that I can prove to him that our position is not established on the basis of prejudice but a real concern about the implications for the renewables obligation of accepting this amendment.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000034"></a>Let me start on points of disagreement before getting on to the more difficult issues. We accept what the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, maintains as his major proposition that biogas is renewable when it is derived from plant and animal matter. It is therefore already eligible for reward under the renewables obligation. We are not in conflict at all on that part of the issue. I shall come to the difficulties that we have in a moment, but I emphasise that we have always recognised the importance of biogas and its versatility, which is why the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced earlier this year that &#163;10 million would be made available for the construction of new commercial-scale anaerobic digestion plant. The Government are acting towards stimulating development.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000035"></a>Electricity generated from biogas will be eligible for two ROCs per MWh under the proposed changes to the renewables obligation, and biogas can receive support under the renewable transport fuel obligation. It can also be used to generate heat, as noble Lords have indicated in this short debate, and therefore may be eligible to receive support under any future mechanism to support renewable heat, which will be the subject of later discussions in Committee.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000036"></a>By removing the carbon dioxide and other impurities, biogas can be used to make biomethane, which could be injected directly into the gas network. It is theoretically possible to inject biomethane directly into the gas network in the UK provided that the biomethane can meet gas quality standards and the pressure requirements of the national grid.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000037"></a>So far, so good. We recognise the advantages that biogas could bring across electricity, heat and transport, but there are difficulties with this amendment that I hope are based on rational judgment and not prejudices within the department. If accepted, the new clause would mean that biomethane gas was fed into the gas grid and then an equivalent amount of gas used by a specified consumer could be treated as renewable&#151;even

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000038"></a>Such a move would widen the definition of a renewable source of electricity but break the direct link with the award of ROCs for actual generation. That is a fundamental principle of the renewables obligation. Even if it is contended that this is a well-known prejudice of the department, I shall defend the principle against the amendment.</p>

However, I take issue with the generation of electricity from renewables being fed into the grid and somehow moving immutably from a wind turbine offshore, of which I am great supporter, to the consumer buying that green electricity, who might be anywhere. You cannot tell where electricity is because you feed from renewable sources into the national grid. There is no colour coding system to make the electricity come out green. Even though ROCs are being used for wind turbines, the electricity could have been generated from a nuclear power plant, coal power station or gas power station. It could have been generated from a wind turbine, but that cannot be proven, exactly like biomethane. If you feed biomethane into the grid you do not know what will come out the other end. I find it interesting that the Minister is saying that there is a direct link between green electricity production and use, and biomethane production and then biomethane use.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000041"></a>Let me say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that we have problems with the coalfield position. There is obviously an issue of how clean the gas is in terms of carbon dioxide, and that is why it is not supported under the renewable obligation. But we are offering an incentive through explicitly exempting coal methane from the climate change levy.</p>

I know that the noble Lord wants us to move on and I will listen carefully to his argument, but I am not sure about the noble Lord&#146;s case to change the concept of the renewable obligation in order to produce this particular stimulus as far as coal methane is concerned. That is the nature of the problem. The noble Lord will recognise that the Government and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, are on the same side of the argument about how we can generate electricity from increasing numbers of renewable resources,

We believe that it is important that the consumer does not support generation that is not from renewable sources. For other plants which burn fuels such as biomass, the renewable obligation has always required both delivery of the actual fuel to the station and that the biomass content of the fuel can be determined on the site. Breaking that link opens significant scope&#151;and I hope that this answers the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh&#151;for double counting or even fraud, as audit of the arrangements would be very problematic indeed. For example, it would be possible for the renewable biomethane gas in theory to be shipped and premixed with fossil fuel from overseas as part of the load from a liquefied natural gas tanker. How would Ofgem tell whether that was the case? Arranging for the shipping might also be a low hurdle to clear to benefit from the renewables obligation and it would be difficult to audit to ensure that consumers received value for money. It is possible that those issues may be resolved, but we do not think that that is the case at present. We are not sure that we would be able to control the operation of the renewables obligation.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000046"></a>The noble Lord, of all people, ought not to seek to occasion the Government to pursue a strategy which might open the door not to the increased consumption of renewables but to their substitution through the subsidy and to the destruction of the crucial relationship between the renewables obligation and the generation of electricity. Once we depart from that point, we come up against difficulties.</p>

By its very nature, biomethane has to be cleaned and scrubbed of CO2 before it can be injected into the grid network. Therefore, any gas produced in that way could be measured very carefully and, once it was pumped into the network, he would have a figure that showed how much biomethane was going into the grid network. It would not be beyond the wit of man then to work out that, if that was the amount of power going in, the amount of power coming out could be linked to it, and there would be a direct link between the two systems.</p>

Wind turbines produce electricity that is measured and pumped into the national grid and is then used by companies that want to buy green electricity. Perhaps the Minister can say where I am wrong, but I do not see how that is not breaking the link, because the electricity is fed into the national grid. I do not understand why the controlled and measured dispatch of biomethane from the cleaning process into the grid network cannot be measured and dealt with in the same way.</p>

We would be concerned about our ability to track the movement of biomethane gas in this way. I return to the principle. Surely the noble Lord accepts that ROCs are awarded according to the generation of electricity&#151;not on the use of the electricity nor on the production of the fuel but on the generation of the electricity&#151;but his amendment would open up a crucial change to the ROCs concept.

I do not know how it works, but if gas is going to enter a gas grid, it should be perfectly possible to deal with it in exactly the same way as electricity being fed into the electricity grid.</p>

In an earlier Bill I described that as losing sight of the objective and concentrating on the means. The means and the objective are being confused. The objective is to reduce carbon and to supply energy, it is not to protect an artificial concept like ROCs. This is where the Government really have gone quite sadly wrong.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is right because we tend to think of these things in financial terms. We are thinking about how to stick to ROCs, but the whole basis for a renewables obligation and the reason so many of us are interested in this field is because we are running out of fossil fuels&#151;this is a way of bringing forward a renewable source of energy&#151;and we are worried about carbon. They are the issues that concern us most. We are hidebound by ROCs, so a situation has developed where enormous amounts of methane are allowed to escape into the atmosphere, yet we are stopping ourselves from using such sources developed on a local scale in order to reduce the amount of fossil fuel we use. Given that situation, there is a fundamental flaw in ROCs.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000060"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment, which may be less exciting if less odorous than one or two that have gone before it, would oblige companies that generate electricity to disclose the amount and value of any allocation they have received through the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Noble Lords should understand that we are not seeking to impose unnecessary and costly extra burdens on business, but publishing this information would be advantageous to consumers and investors&#151;and, we consider, should not be too costly to administer. Each round of the EU ETS will become more stringent. It is likely that soon the UK&#146;s allocation of credits will be auctioned off rather than simply passed on free to companies, so putting a clear price on them. This proposal should provide a higher level of transparency.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000061"></a>The Minister in another place said in response to a similar amendment that this is an issue that time would resolve. I would like the Minister to be more specific about exactly how time will resolve it. What form does he see company reporting mechanisms taking? As a price will be attached to allocations on their initial auction, it seems to me that a company will have

What other powers are there to impose that reporting responsibility on business; and what is the Government's attitude to using those powers? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080624120000062"></a><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="080624120000111"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I welcome the amendment about transparency in the EU ETS. I was very disappointed that since the Climate Change Bill moved to the other place, the Government are seeking to take out the corporate reporting clauses that were accepted by the Minister in this House. I approach the amendment with some concern about the Government's response. The EU ETS is a very important instrument, and one that we will talk about under other amendments that we will propose from our Benches. The amendment leads to greater transparency and I very much welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="080624120000063"></a><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="080624120000112"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The proposed new clause pertaining to an amendment to the EU emissions trading scheme and company reporting was debated in another place. We thought that we had gone a great way to reassure honourable Members on the other side in another place that it was not necessary. Let me see whether I can reassure the noble Lord tonight.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000064"></a>The amendment is drafted with the aim of identifying the so-called windfall profits of companies participating in the trading scheme. Let me say a few words about the EU ETS&#151;not many, I promise&#151;before addressing the new clause specifically. As the Committee knows, the EU ETS was launched in 2005 and in its first phase, which ended last year in 2007, companies were allocated carbon credits that could then be traded. The carbon credits and trading system established a market for carbon. The scheme was very ambitious; some might describe it as revolutionary; and, let it be said, it faced some problems in that first phase, most of which got pretty wide publicity.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000065"></a>For example, we recognise that generators have profited from the ETS. However, we in the UK and, I believe, in the EU generally, have learnt from those problems and are now attempting to improve the scheme from the experience that we have gained. Phase 2 began in January this year. It has reduced the overall allocation of carbon credits and raised the expected price for carbon from 2008 to 2012. It is currently at about &#8364;25 per tonne. In the second phase, the UK will auction 7 per cent of allowances to the large electricity producers. We are in discussion with the Commission about the post-2012 phase 3 of the scheme. We announced in this year&#146;s Budget that we would auction 100 per cent allowances to the large electricity producers in phase 3. We believe that auctioning, as well as being the most efficient way to make allocations, will address the issue of windfall profits.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000066"></a>I turn to the amendment. As the noble Lord will know, the amount of carbon allocations that companies receive is already published by Defra on its website. Likewise, the market price for the allocations is already published. Therefore, requiring the generators to publish this information would create duplication and an unnecessary administrative burden.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000067"></a>The amount paid for the carbon allowances which generators buy from other EU ETS participants is not published, but is commercially sensitive information. The generators are not, for example, expected to publish the price they pay for coal, gas or oil, or the rates they pay their contractors, which we happen to believe&#151;I hope that the noble Lord does, too&#151;is absolutely right in a competitive market. Requiring suppliers to publish such information could lead to a distortion of the market.</p>

<a name="80624-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080624120000068"></a>For those two distinct reasons&#151;first, that some of the information, which is not sensitive, is already published; secondly, that that which is commercially sensitive should remain so&#151;the amendment should be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="080624120000069"></a><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080624120000113"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for his response. I will give it consideration.</p>

However, as the Minister said, one might wish to withhold that simply on the basis of commercial confidentiality, but I cannot see how the price will be known, because each company will strike its own price in every deal.</p>

<p><a name="080624120000071"></a><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80624-gc0008.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="080624120000115"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I believe that the market price for the allocations is already published.

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08062492000011"></a><a name="80624-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80624-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08062492000065"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Maria Eagle, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08062492000012"></a>On 6 December 2007, my right honourable friend the Minister of State, David Hanson, published a Command Paper&#151;the Government&#146;s response to the report by Baroness Corston of a <I>Review of Women with Particular Vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System</I> (Cm 7261).</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08062492000013"></a>The paper detailed how the Government planned to respond to the 43 recommendations made by my right honourable and noble friend Baroness Corston in her report. I am today updating Parliament and publishing a report on progress made over the past six months in taking forward the Government&#146;s response, detailing the Government&#146;s continued commitment to bring about real improvements for women offenders in both custody and the community. I have placed copies of the progress report in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. Copies are also available on the internet at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement">www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement</a> 240608b.htm.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08062492000014"></a>Since being appointed as the Ministerial Champion for Women and Criminal Justice matters, I am pleased to report the significant actions which we have been able to deliver against the commitments made in the Government&#146;s response:</p>
 in respect of the recommendation that the number of strip searches in women's prisons be reduced, it has been usual practice for women prisoners to be strip searched on leaving and entering prison. This can be intimidating and distressing, particularly for women who have experienced domestic violence or sexual abuse. Pilots are now running in five women's prisons testing a new kind of search which does not require the removal of underwear unless there is intelligence or suspicion at any stage that an item is concealed in the underwear. The pilots are going well and the impact of the new model women&#146;s full search is now being evaluated. The early results are encouraging and I am confident that new arrangements will shortly be in place in all women&#146;s prisons;the Ministry of Justice will issue guidance to probation areas on making greater use of capacity in the current female approved premises. Areas will be encouraged to consider placing more women in them, who may not necessarily present a high risk of harm to others, but who could benefit from the supervised, structured environment and the support that an approved premises can provide. I expect this guidance will be issued in July 2008;  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS92"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column WS92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a site in Bristol has been identified for piloting an integrated approach providing access to a range of community-based services and residential facilities. The target group will be women involved in the criminal justice system, particularly those who may have a range of vulnerabilities or who may be at risk of ending up in custody. The project will be delivered in partnership with other agencies;the Ministry of Justice has supported financially the establishment and continued development of the women&#146;s Turnaround Project in Wales. The project clearly demonstrates the value of multiagency, multisector work and has rapidly achieved an excellent reputation for working with women offenders and women at risk of offending;the Ministry of Justice is looking at diverting women offenders from custody into community provision where that is appropriate. Above and beyond Baroness Corston&#146;s recommendations, more pro-active steps need to be taken to reduce the number of women going into custody unnecessarily. Options will be developed over the coming months to create a deliverable plan of action to achieve this; the Government aim to make better use of the conditional cautioning scheme for women as an alternative to court proceedings. National roll-out of this scheme has just been completed and provides offenders who have admitted committing a low-level offence the opportunity to be diverted from court by accepting a caution with conditions. Consideration is being given to testing out a rehabilitative condition for women as part of their caution. In this instance, the main condition will be to attend a women&#146;s centre for assessment. This will link with the Together Women Programme sites to test the benefit of combining a caution with access to the supportive wrap-around services available; a short project was set up to consider the recommendation advocating small custodial units for 20 to 30 women. The Government accept the principles Baroness Corston developed, but the findings of the project identified significant issues that suggest standalone units of that size are neither feasible nor desirable. In addition, it would not be possible to deliver the range of services required to meet the full range of women&#146;s specific needs. The design of a new 77 place wing at HMP Bronzefield (due for completion in 2009) will provide an opportunity to implement, test and embed a new approach to the physical environment and delivery of regimes that could test out these principles;the Ministry of Justice Gender Equality Scheme was published on 1 April 2008.  The scheme sets out what is being done to promote gender equality and eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment in all our business areas, decisions and activities. The principles in the Gender Equality Scheme underpin everything we do as a department and will ensure fair and equal treatment for all;on 30 May 2008, the Ministry of Justice published a national service framework for women offenders. The framework clearly lays out the Government&#146;s

The guide details some of the issues, challenges, and opportunities that need to be considered when working with women offenders at all stages of the offender process, including the importance of promoting and developing community-based alternatives to custody;the Prison Service has introduced a set of gender-specific standards for women&#146;s prisons. The standards, which were published on 28 April 2008 in a new Prison Service Order (4800), will ensure that prisons provide regimes, programmes and support that are sensitive and appropriate for women;a cross-departmental Criminal Justice Women&#146;s Unit has been established with a senior civil servant appointed to head up the unit. This will manage and co-ordinate the work on Corston across all relevant departments; andthe interministerial group (IMG) on reducing reoffending now provides overall governance, ensuring cross-departmental commitment to the actions required. I have convened a sub-group to the IMG to drive the work forward and monitor progress against our commitments. Members include the Solicitor-General and Ministers from the Government Equalities Office, Department of Health, Department for Innovation Universities and Skills, Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Home Office.
<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08062492000015"></a>Another key commitment is to improve health and social care services for women in contact with the criminal justice system. Health-related commissioning guidance specifically focused on services for women and their families will be developed by December 2008. The Government will also have reviewed and set out recommendations for improvements in the healthcare provided to women in police custody, in court cells and during transportation to prison.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08062492000016"></a>I would like to thank my ministerial colleagues and officials in their departments who have contributed to the progress made and I look forward to continuing working with them, and our non-government stakeholders, in taking forward these commitments further. As the Ministerial Champion for Women and Criminal Justice matters, I will continue to make sure that everything possible is done to ensure that we have a system that is properly responsive to the needs and characteristics of women.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08062492000019"></a>The right to vote is the basis of our political system. Strengthening our democracy requires the removal of barriers to the exercise of that right. So the system for  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS94"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column WS94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>delivering elections must be accessible and responsive to the needs of voters. And accessibility must always go hand in hand with the security of the system: citizens need to be confident that their vote will count, and that elections are fair and free from fraud. It is the twin principles of accessibility and integrity that underpin the legitimacy of our electoral process.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08062492000020"></a>In <I>The Governance of Britain</I> Green Paper, the Government set out a programme of work to reinvigorate our democracy and give citizens the means to participate in decision-making at every level. As part of this programme, the Government committed to consult on moving elections to the weekend as a means of making voting more accessible, and so potentially raising levels of turnout.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08062492000021"></a>To meet that commitment, I am today publishing a consultation paper, <I>Election Day</I> (Cm 7334). The paper invites views on the merits of moving the voting day for Parliamentary and European Parliamentary elections, and local elections in England and Wales, from the traditional Thursday to the weekend; and on the best way to do this. The paper sets out a range of issues that need to be taken into account, including practical considerations and the potential cost of holding elections at the weekend, and invites views and evidence. It makes clear that, in the event that elections were moved to the weekend, this would need to be implemented in a way which did not interfere with religious observance.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08062492000022"></a>This consultation paper marks the start of a process of engagement on Election Day. The Government are committed to exploring new forms of engagement to encourage greater public involvement in policy-making. The Government believe that the question of when elections should be held is an issue that would benefit from this new approach. So the consultation exercise I am launching today will be followed by a citizens' summit at which a cross-section of the public will be invited to consider the barriers to voting and the options available to improve participation levels.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08062492000023"></a>A citizens' summit involves bringing together a broad sample of the public to deliberate and discuss issues of national policy. The Government believe that such techniques can improve the national policy-making process by introducing opportunities for a deliberative dialogue between Government and the public and encouraging people to debate policy options between themselves, to ask questions and to make informed recommendations to their representatives in Government and Parliament. Participants at this summit will be asked to deliberate on the issues, including those raised in the consultation and to make a recommendation on whether elections should be held at the weekend. The Government will respond to the consultation exercise after the summit with their view about the intended way forward.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08062492000024"></a>I also intend that the summit should discuss more widely the factors that motivate people to exercise their right to vote. The sense of a civic duty to vote has eroded over the past 50 years. It is vital for the health of our democracy that we better understand the reasons for this, and what we can do to reverse the trend of falling turnout.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08062492000025"></a>The consultation process on Election Day is an opportunity for a wide debate about how the democratic process can be shaped to the needs and preferences of

But, whatever changes are made, we also need to ensure that the integrity of the electoral process is protected and enhanced.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08062492000026"></a>Government have taken a range of steps in recent years both to modernise the registration process and to improve access to postal voting with all-party support.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08062492000027"></a>Alongside this, the Government have put in place a range of measures to combat attempts to defraud the registration and postal vote processes, including in the Electoral Administration Act 2006. Electoral registration officers have powers to compare registration data with records held by local authorities. Voters now have to supply date of birth and signature, which can be cross-checked when they apply for a postal ballot, and we have given administrators more time to carry out checks.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08062492000028"></a>There is no evidence that overall levels of fraud are increasing. But the Government take the integrity of the electoral process seriously: any fraud is unacceptable, and we are examining how, consistent with the need to ensure that citizens can access their right to vote, the security of both the registration system and the postal vote process could be strengthened. In that context, we plan to consult on issues relating to the security of the ballot. Any change would have to take account of the need to ensure that we do not act to exclude citizens from the democratic process, and of the significant resource commitment that would be required to deliver reform.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08062492000029"></a>The Government are committed to change to the electoral system in a balanced way so that participation increases, and the security and accuracy of the ballot are protected. I hope that all those with an interest in the health of our democratic process will consider and respond to the proposals that I am launching for consultation today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08062492000037"></a>In December, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills and I published a consultation document, <I>Confidence in Standards: Regulating and developing qualifications and assessment</I> (Cm 7281). We detailed plans for the creation of a new independent regulator of qualifications and tests for England&#151;the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual), and the evolution of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) into a development agency for curriculum, assessment and qualifications.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08062492000038"></a>The consultation finished in March, and in a Statement to the House on 2 April I confirmed that the proposals had been generally well received and that we were therefore proceeding with these reforms, including bringing forward new legislation. We also confirmed that Ofqual was about to be set up in an interim form, using the QCA&#146;s current regulatory powers. Ofqual was duly launched in its interim form on 8 April.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08062492000040"></a>Ofqual will be a credible and clearly independent guardian of standards across the assessment and qualifications system, securing confidence in that system. Subject to legislation, it will become a regulator with even stronger powers to safeguard standards. The QCA, in its new form as the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) will be able to focus on advising Ministers on the curriculum and on developing and delivering qualifications and assessments. These reforms have been widely welcomed,

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08062492000043"></a>Rateable values are assessed independently by the Valuation Office Agency and are generally based on annual rental values. Most are assessed having regard to actual rents but such evidence is not always available. In about 11 per cent of cases, rateable value is based on capital values (found from the cost of construction and land values) which is then &#147;decapitalised&#148; to give an annual value representing the rateable value. This is called the &#147;contractor&#146;s method of valuation&#148;. The decapitalisation rate used in the valuation is prescribed by the Government.</p>

to continue to prescribe the decapitalisation rate for the 2010 revaluation;to retain the existing groupings of properties subject to each of the two decapitalisation rates, andas to the methodology to be used to determining the decapitalisation rates.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08062492000048"></a>In seeking to ensure that the events that led to the spoiling of a significant number of ballot papers in the election to the Scottish Parliament in 2007 do not happen again, my overriding priority has been to put the interests of the voter first.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08062492000049"></a>On 23 October last year, Ron Gould reported on his review of the 2007 Scottish elections. I said to Parliament then that the Gould report was a valuable contribution to the analysis of what went wrong last May, and I gave a commitment to provide a full response to the report once I had heard the views of a  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS98"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column WS98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wide range of interests through consultation and debate. The Scotland Office initiated that consultation through our paper, <I>Sorting the Ballot</I>. Meetings were held with electoral administrators, political parties and the Electoral Commission to hear their views on Gould&#146;s recommendations. In addition, a number of focus groups were held with voters across Scotland. I also welcomed the move from the Scottish Affairs Committee to conduct its own review of the Gould report and its recommendations. The committee reported on 18 May and its recommendations have been taken into account when considering the Government&#146;s response. (I shall be responding separately to the Committee&#146;s report later today.)</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80624-wms0002.htm"/>


<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08062492000050"></a>Last October, I commended the Gould report to the House. It offered proposals to all stakeholders involved in the administration of elections in Scotland. Proposals that aim to improve the way in which Scottish elections are administered and suggest good practices which could inform the running of other elections in the UK.  It is my view that all political parties should work together to build on the proposals in the Gould report in order to improve the election process in Scotland.  Elections belong to the people not individual political parties, and that is why we must work for consensus across the board and to ensure that the Scottish voter is put first.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08062492000051"></a>One of the most important steps to put the needs of the voter first is the decoupling of the local government from the Scottish Parliament elections. The decision to combine the elections was taken by the Scottish Parliament.  Decoupling will go a long way to delivering the simplicity and clarity that Ron Gould has identified as being needed for elections taking place in Scotland. After the May 2007 elections, when voters were asked by an independent researcher to choose the top priority for the next election, the most popular option was having the Scottish Parliament and local government elections on separate days.  This was confirmed by the focus groups referred to above, where the most frequently heard comments asked were why there were two elections using different processes on the same day and why couldn&#146;t they be held on different days. Responsibility for Scottish local authority elections rests with the Scottish Executive.  I therefore welcome the Scottish Executive&#146;s consultation, which was launched on 3 March, on how they might decouple the local government elections from the Parliament elections. It will benefit all those involved with elections if this proceeds.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08062492000052"></a>In my Statement to the House last October, I accepted outright five recommendations which, in my view, could make a significant improvement to the running of elections to the Scottish Parliament.  These were a reversion to manual counting; separate ballot papers for the constituency and regional votes; a longer period between close of nominations and the date of election; a six-month cut-off for changes in the law governing the conduct of elections; and consolidation of the legislation on the conduct of Scottish Parliament elections.  I am pleased to say that the results of our consultation confirm that these five recommendations have overwhelming support. I would like now to set out my response to the other Gould recommendations on which we consulted.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS99"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column WS99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08062492000053"></a>First, on ballot paper design, the Government accept the Gould recommendation that registered party names should appear first on the regional ballot paper, followed by party description. It is important that voters know which party it is that they are voting for and that they know they are voting for a party rather than an individual in the regional vote.  The focus groups in particular highlighted that voters prefer the certainty of the registered party names which are less liable to change than the party descriptors.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08062492000054"></a>While we respect the intention of Gould&#146;s further recommendation that ballot paper ordering should be determined by lottery, a strong case has been made against such a move on the grounds of voter confusion, particularly for those with learning difficulties.  There was strong support among the focus groups and others consulted for retaining alphabetical order on the grounds that that is what people are used to and it is easier to find the candidate or party of the voter&#146;s choice.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08062492000055"></a>On the timing of the count, I have decided that there should be no change from the current arrangements; ie, that the count should take place as soon as practicable after the polls close. There was no direct link between the timing of the count and the problems that occurred last May. Convention is that the count takes place overnight as the ballot boxes come in and, as the focus groups showed, voters enjoy the experience of hearing the results as soon as possible.  Voters and candidates should wait no longer to know the results than is necessary to count the ballot papers and verify the result. The final decision on when it is practicable that the count should take place, given local circumstances, though, will remain a matter for individual returning officers.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08062492000056"></a>I have considered the question of whether a chief returning officer (CRO) should be appointed with full responsibility for administering all elections. The Gould report sets out a range of functions that a CRO might fulfil. However, the views that have been expressed across the political spectrum and by administrators are not conclusive. A considered examination of the structures required for administering elections in Scotland is necessary and I note that the Electoral Commission has taken the initiative in leading on an investigation on this subject and their report is expected later this summer. The Scottish Executive has also indicated that they propose to consult on the detailed options for a CRO for local authority elections later this year. Given the need to ensure a consistent approach across elections in the potential role of a CRO, and the ongoing consideration that is being given to this issue, I have decided that the Government should work closely with colleagues across government, the Electoral Commission and the Scottish Executive in examining this in more detail before a final decision is reached.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08062492000057"></a>This will take time as any change would require primary and secondary legislation. I am very conscious of the need to make decisions now for the elections in 2011 so that there is no uncertainty about how these elections will be run. I am also conscious of the need for a period of stability in order to rebuild confidence in our electoral processes. I do not think it practical therefore to make decisions on a CRO to enable such a person to be in place for the 2011 election. That is not  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS100"></a><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column WS100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to rule out the concept, but rather to ensure that sufficient time is available to give the matter the consideration it deserves.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08062492000058"></a>The recommendations that we have already accepted, together with the proposed decoupling of elections, will address the issues of accountability that underpinned the reasons why Gould recommended a CRO. These steps will ensure there is greater clarity in the election process. I accept the recommendation of the All-Party Scottish Affairs Select Committee that there is no compelling case to change the present legislative arrangements for elections to the Scottish Parliament. However, accepting Gould&#146;s view that co-ordination of elections can be improved, I propose to establish, on a non-statutory basis, an elections policy and planning group for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2011. This group, chaired, for the first time, by a senior returning officer, will report to me on a regular basis on progress with the commitments that I have set out today.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08062492000059"></a>Gould also raised commonly voiced concerns about consistency and professionalism among electoral administrators. This, to a large degree, is being addressed by the work of the Electoral Commission in developing performance standards. As this is a new monitoring regime for electoral administrators, once it has been introduced we will need to give it time to establish itself, before reviewing whether any further action is required.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08062492000060"></a>By the end of this year, as Gould recommended, work will have begun on consolidating the legislation that governs the Scottish Parliament elections into a single statutory instrument; we have committed to achieving this at least six months before the 2011 elections are held.</p>

<a name="80624-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08062492000061"></a>Our key task now is to re-build the confidence of voters in casting their vote. The steps I have set out today are, I believe, the right ones to take to ensure that the problems of the 2007 election never happen again.</p>

<a name="80624w0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_180"></a><a name="080624116000268"></a>By the end of 2008 the Government expect to have paid &#163;52.8 million in coal investment aid to support mine investment and maintain access to economically viable coal reserves. This has been in addition to &#163;162 million paid under the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme during 2000 to 2002. As a result of this past support, UK coal producers have been better placed to benefit from the recent recovery in market prices, to the extent that several new developments are now in progress which are wholly commercially funded.</p>
