Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Ms Gillian
Merron) has made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06110838000008"></a>On 1
August 2005 the department launched a consultation paper seeking views
on the principle of whether foreign-registered aircraft based in the UK
being used for noncommercial purposes should be required to be placed
on the UK or another EU register. This would ensure that the safety of
such aircraft was overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority or another
EU aviation authority and that they were operated to European safety
standards.</p><p><a name="06110838000009"></a>The
Government have considered the responses to the consultation carefully
and decided that it would not be appropriate at this time to introduce
a requirement to place such aircraft on the UK
register.</p><p><a name="06110838000010"></a>The
Government response to the consultation has today been published and is
available on the department's website, at www.dft.gov.uk. Copies have
also been placed in the House
Libraries.</p><p><a name="06110838000011"></a>The response explains
that the Government's objective remains that aircraft based in the UK
should be required to meet safety standards acceptable within Europe
and be subject to checking by the UK and other European aviation
authorities.</p><p><a name="06110838000012"></a>European
proposals published in November 2005 to extend the scope of common
European aviation safety rules may provide scope for a better means of
achieving that objective in a proportionate way. Stakeholders have been
consulted generally on the proposal &#147;to amend Regulation (EC) No
1592/2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and
establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency&#148;. This proposal
specifically amends the scope of the EASA regulation to include a
category of aircraft registered in a third country and used into,
within or out of the Community by an operator established or residing
in the Community. Detailed implementing rules will be needed to give
force to this amendment and we would expect the agency to consult
stakeholders on the details of its proposals at the appropriate
time.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06110838000003"></a>Crime:

Mining of Afghanistan's natural resources such as coal, gas and
minerals represents a significant economic opportunity over the medium
and long term. DfID, the US and the World Bank have provided support to
help the Government of Afghanistan develop this sector. DfID provides
&#163;3.85 million in technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines
and the Afghan Geological Survey, to help build institutional capacity
to manage these resources and attract foreign
investment.</p><p><a name="06110837000064"></a>DfID
provides &#163;1 million to the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Fund
(AIGF)&#151;a World Bank administered trust fund that pools funding
from the Asian Development Bank and Germany. This is an innovative
mechanism which seeks to help entrepreneurs overcome the risks involved
in investing in fragile and post-conflict states. To date, $18 million
in foreign investment has been leveraged for an agri-business project
in northern Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06110837000065"></a>DfID
also provides funding for research on other economic opportunities that
create jobs andwealth. For example, the Afghanistan Research
and Evaluation Unit (AREU) has explored the prospects for trade and
enterprise in sectors such as carpets, raisins, and construction
materials.</p>

development, and create an investment climate conducive to economic
growth. DfID also provides &#163;3.85 million to the Ministry of
Mines to help the GoA manage its natural resources and attract foreign

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> A review of the Army post-operational
stress management (POSM) policy was undertaken in September 2005. No
substantive changes were made to the section of the policy relating to
the role of families and colleagues in detecting mental ill health,
since it already recognised that friends and family, colleagues, and
those in the chain of command all have a part to play in detecting and
managing operational stress. The policy recognises that they are often
the first to notice changes of mood, behaviour or work performance in
someone who has returned from an operational
tour.</p><p><a name="06110837000083"></a>We emphasise the
importance of families being made fully aware of the warning signs and
symptoms, what they can do and who can help them, and we offer
presentations and leaflets as part of this educational
process.</p><p><a name="06110837000084"></a>Efforts
are also made to arrange a &#147;decompression period&#148; for
personnel immediately prior returning from deployment. The exact form
of the decompression period varies between the services and depends on
the individual unit's circumstances, but in general it allows personnel
mentally and physically to unwind after their operational tour and
provides them the opportunity to talk to friends, colleagues and
superiors about their
experiences.</p><p><a name="06110837000085"></a>The individual
unit's chain of command uses the decompression period to monitor and
identify those personnel who are apparently most vulnerable to any form
of post-operational stress or stress-related condition. During this
time, all personnel are offered a briefing on post-operational
stress.</p><p><a name="06110837000086"></a>Once
back at their home base, if treatment is required for a mental health
condition this is provided either as out-patient treatment in one of
our 15 regional departments of community mental health (DCMHs) in the
UK or satellite centres overseas, or as in-patient treatment at
regional facilities run by the Priory Group. The regional locations of
the DCMHs and the Priory facilities mean that treatment can be provided
close to an individual's unit, base or home, thus allowing the vital
support from families to
continue.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06110837000008"></a>Armed

the Equality Commission in July
2006.</p><p><a name="06110837000234"></a>Information
on consultations prior to 2001 is not available. However, as part of
the equality screening and equality impact assessment processes set out
in the equality scheme, the Northern Ireland Office provides an
opportunity for consultation groups, stakeholders and the wider public
to contribute to NIO polices and legislation including, where
appropriate, written consultation exercises, focus groups and public
meetings. The aim is to increase the involvement of people and groups
in public consultation and to seek their views. Obtaining views from
across the community in the form of public consultations is considered
an important part of policy-making and
development.</p><p><a name="06110837000235"></a>Consultations
are carried out in accordance with the Cabinet Office code of practice
on written consultation, and the consultation period will normally last
for a minimum of 12 weeks to give the public time to respond. The
Northern Ireland Office consults with the list of consultees named in
the Northern Ireland Equality Commission&#146;s guide to the
statutory duties, and since 2001 this list has been updated annually
and on request throughout the year. Further details on equality-related
consultation exercises may be found in the five-year review of the NIO
equality scheme on the Northern Ireland Office website at
www.nio.gov.uk.</p><p><a name="06110837000236"></a>There would be
disproportionate costs associated with the collation of information on
responses toall consultations. However, the Northern Ireland
Office website at www.nio.gov.uk provides a libraryof
consultations and, where available, the summary of responses and any
associated revision to the policy or legislation, although, as equality
is mainstreamed effectively into decision making, it can be difficult
to identify changes to a policy made as a result of consultation
alone.</p><p><a name="06110837000237"></a><b><a name="61108w0002.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="06110837001925"></a>Lord

which is publicly available on its website at http://www.ofmd

consults groups and individuals who have requested that they be

Rooker:</b> As Section 75 did not come into force
until 1 January 2000, the Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety did not carry out any consultations under the terms of
Section 75 before
then.</p><p><a name="06110837000246"></a>The
Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has not
maintained a central comprehensive register with details of all

Answer to these Questions without incurring disproportionate costs.
However, records have been maintained showing that 20 equality impact
assessments (EQIAs) have been carried out since January 2000 under
Section 75. Details of these EQIAs can be found on the
department&#146;s website at www.dhsspsni.gov.

list which is updated on an ongoing basis. The current list has been
placed in the Library.</p><p><a name="06110837000248"></a>While
there is little evidence in the EQIA reports to indicate that the
outcome of the consultations alone resulted in any significant changes
to the 20 policies concerned, there are examples of the EQIA process
having prompted changes and improvements to better promote equality of
opportunity. Details, including examples, can be found at the

Like all large organisations, Defra faces new financial pressures each
year which require us constantly to review and adjust our spending
plans. We conducted a rigorous review of financial allocations during
the summer of 2006 which included detailed discussions with our
agencies and other external bodies to agree where spending might best
be reduced. This review was comprehensive in nature and has ensured
that Defra's funding for the current year is placed where it can have
the greatest impact. Switches of funding between budget categories
result where the review identifies that priorities are best served by
transferring allocation between them and estimate and budgetary rules

These factors are currently 0.11 kg CO2 per passenger

this necessary. Where possible, this is from civilian sources but, if
necessary, from the UK military. The most recent humanitarian example

costs of chartering helicopters, the provision of technical personnel
and vehicles, and co-ordination activities. DfID provided further funds

only safe way to travel in a dangerous environment in northern Uganda.
The helicopter was hired from a commercial company in Kenya as the

review of the 2002 national agreement on arrangements for the
attendance of interpreters in investigations and proceedings within the
criminal justice
system.</p><p><a name="06110837001654"></a>The
guidance contained in that agreement already makes clear that
interpreters working in a court or a police station should, wherever
possible, be registered with the National Register of Public Service
Interpreters (NRPSI) or the Council for the Advancement of
Communication with Deaf
People.</p><p><a name="06110837001655"></a>If, in
an individual case, it is not possible to select an interpreter from

interpreter selected meets standards at least equal to those required
for registration. This is the recommended good practice
standard.</p><p><a name="06110837001656"></a>However, we are aware
that there are shortages of interpreters in some languages and in some
parts of the country. Rural areas may face particular difficulties in
finding qualified interpreters compared with metropolitan areas, which
usually have a more cosmopolitan population. These are difficult issues
which the review is looking
into.</p><p><a name="06110837001657"></a>Monitoring of interpreter
usage is one of the issues being considered in the current review.
However, a national call centre for interpreters is not one of the
options under consideration. We believe there are other ways of
addressing current problems in interpreter

his statement that English Nature requested closure because of the pink

purposes with a possible request to designate the area as a special
area for conservation to protect the reefs and wider biodiversity.
English Nature did advise that increased scalloping was having a
significant impact on important reef features and it recommended the
closure of 60 square miles&#151;8 per cent&#151;of Lyme Bay. It
also provided advice that the area is the habitatof pink sea
fans, ross corals and sunset corals that have been afforded protection
under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended. However, in
subsequent discussions, English Nature concentrated on the need to
protect pink sea fans and the department took this on
board.</p><p><a name="06110837001687"></a>After due consideration
of all of the evidence produced in relation to this matter, my
honourable friend the Minister for Fisheries, Mr Ben Bradshaw,
concluded that a zonal solution was the most appropriate in all the
circumstances to date. That afforded seven times the protection for
pink sea fans that had existed under the previous voluntary agreement
and the areas provided protection to over 92 per cent of the known pink
sea fan sites.</p>

pollution is associated with adverse health effects. An assessment
carried out for the review of the air quality strategy<sup>1</sup>
estimated that the level of man-made particulate air pollution
experienced in the UK in 2005 would be expected to reduce average life
expectancy by up to about eight months. This health impact in 2005 is
estimated to cost up to &#163;9 billionto &#163;21.4
billion per annum. Road transport will contribute to these
effects.</p><p><a name="06110837001719"></a>Ozone and particulate
matter are long-range pollutants which may travel hundreds of miles
before reaching the UK. Particulate matter does have a local component,
and local road transport contributes a proportion of this. For ozone,
local road transport emissions actually reduce peak levels in cities
due to the destruction of ozone in reaction with vehicle
emissions.</p><p><a name="06110837001720"></a>The Department of
Health's Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP)
quantification sub-group, in its report <I>The quantification of the

in 1998<sup>2</sup> the number of deaths brought forward due to
short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10), ozone and
sulphur dioxide as up to 24,000 per
year.</p><p><a name="06110837001721"></a>Assuming that around a
quarter of the PM10<sup>3</sup> in urban areas is due
directly or indirectly to emissions from transport, as a rough estimate
it can be assumed that up to around 2,000 deaths brought forward in
urban areas may have been related to emissions from transport at that
time.</p><p><a name="06110837001722"></a>This
estimate does not include the impact of transport emissions on life
expectancy and on cardiovascular admissions. These were not quantified
by COMEAP at the time of the 1998 report. Further work on this issue is
likely to be considered as part of the work of the COMEAP sub-group on
quantification.</p><p><a name="06110837001723"></a>Estimates are
made for intense pollutionepisodes. For example, an estimate
was made for the summer smog episode in August 2003<sup>4</sup>. Some
220 to 570 deaths were estimated to have been brought forward over the
two-week period due to ozone and a further 202 due to particulate
matter (PM10). A report and estimate is also being produced
