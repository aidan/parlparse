<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Milverton </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What proposals they have for improving the provision of short stay accommodation for the homeless.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the latest homelessness statistics for England show that the number of households in temporary accommodation has been declining since September 1992. The Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities, to which authorities must by law have regard, makes clear that all temporary accommodation must meet acceptable standards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and for the time he has given me. Does he agree that what is needed is for these people to feel that the accommodation in which they are placed is not just, shall we say, "parking time" but something more homelike? Therefore, does he further agree that those responsible for the conditions of such places should be made more responsible for ensuring that those conditions are reasonably suitable&#151;and I emphasise that? Does the Minister also agree that the management of those premises is such that the accommodation can be made suitable? The Minister may agree that the conditions in some accommodation which the homeless use are not very good. Does the Minister agree with that&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Order!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is a place for the Foyer system, which I shall bring into the debate next week? Does the Minister agree with those two points?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the Government share the concerns of my noble friend as regards the standards which are available to those in temporary accommodation. In my original Answer I mentioned the Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities to which, by law, the authorities must have regard. Indeed, local authorities have significant powers and discretion to control standards of basic amenities and fire safety in such buildings. The Government also understand exactly what my noble friend was referring to when he said that these institutions should be as much like home as possible. That is why the standards and circumstances of these places are monitored very closely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that it is entirely due to government policy that repossessions are set to rise and that that will mean <P>


<a name="column_1786"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1786</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many people who were home owners will be homeless? Does he further agree that they will be homeless because local authorities have been prohibited from using their own capital receipts to build houses and that housing associations have had their grants cut? Is that not both socially destructive and morally wrong?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord is speculating as to whether repossessions will rise as a result of government policy. We have already discussed in this House at some length why capital receipts must be subject to rules and regulations. Debt redemption is possibly more important. I also point out to the noble Lord that all homelessness statistics now show a fall. That reflects the fact that the Government are targeting resources correctly in terms of their homelessness responsibilities. I further point out to the noble Lord that in the financial year 1995-96 we have committed &#163;1.15 billion to the Housing Corporation capital spending.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, does not my noble friend the Minister agree that there is a very real difficulty as between the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment, in that the former department does not allow social security for 16 to 18 year-olds? Therefore, they cannot find accommodation; because they cannot find accommodation they cannot find a job; and because they cannot find a job they cannot find accommodation. Furthermore, does my noble friend further agree that Centrepoint has done extraordinarily good work in diminishing the amount of homelessness among young people and has set up very good accommodation for them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for raising those points. I do not believe that there is any lack of co-ordination between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security. There is a statutory requirement within local authorities for the housing department to co-operate with the social services department. Where their duties are overlapping in order to meet the needs of households they must have regard for each other's services. I also point out to my noble friend that the Government are helping to fund the Foyer initiative which comes from France. It is designed to help young people to find both accommodation and jobs at the same time. I endorse my noble friend's admiration for Centrepoint and for all the other voluntary organisations which have been involved in the Rough Sleepers Initiative in central London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that the Government are simply playing around the fringes of what is a great problem? Can he explain why the Government are not allowing local authorities to build houses for people who are homeless, although they are anxious and willing to do so? Precisely why do not the Government give them the power to do that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, we are certainly not playing around the fringes of the problem. The homelessness figures for England are down by 7 per cent. <P>


<a name="column_1787"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1787</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As I said, this is the 11th quarter running that the figures have fallen. The number of families accepted into temporary accommodation is 11 per cent. fewer than a year previously. Placements in bed-and-breakfast hotels are down 12 per cent. on the previous year and are now 68 per cent. below their peak in September 1991. Government policies are therefore going to the heart of the problem. We are not playing around the fringes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Macleod of Borve: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the Rough Sleepers Initiative is a great success? Can he tell the House how much money the Government are putting into that initiative, which I understand is likely to come to an end next year? Can my noble friend comment on that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend says, all commentators agree that the Rough Sleepers Initiative has been a great success. Since 1990 the Government have put &#163;180 million into that initiative, which aims to make it unnecessary for anyone to have to sleep rough in central London. Perhaps I can bring some comfort to my noble friend by saying that the Government recently announced that they will continue to fund a programme to help people sleeping rough in central London beyond March 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble Earl agree that one of the most destructive things for a family and for children's ability to develop and grow is to have inadequate and temporary housing? Does he agree that it is penny wise, pound foolish for the Government to concentrate solely on debt redemption if the results of that policy are that large sums of money are being paid to the private landlords of temporary accommodation and that many thousands of construction workers are out of work, with all the necessary costs that that imposes on the Exchequer, while presenting a very poor future for the housing and construction industry as a whole? Does the noble Earl agree that it would make more sense to concentrate on solving the problem instead of insisting that local authorities do more to help people who are caught up by all the problems of temporary housing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I think that I have already demonstrated in the figures that I have given that we are solving the problem. The Government are not complacent about homelessness. Wherever homelessness occurs and for whatever reason, it is a concern of the Government. All the statistics point to an encouraging trend, however. I could not agree more with the noble Baroness&#151;indeed, the Government could not agree more&#151;that bed-and-breakfast hotels are unsuitable as temporary accommodation for families with children. We have issued strict guidance which is intended to discourage that practice. By law, local authorities must have regard to it.
<P>

<a name="50614-01_para0"></a>The noble Baroness returned to the issue of debt redemption. As she knows, there are many rules and regulations about capital receipts. Their primary purpose is to ensure that local authority debt can be reduced. However, there are also incentives so that when some <P>


<a name="column_1788"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1788</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>types of asset are sold by local authorities a much higher proportion of the capital receipt arising can be used for local housing.

<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Gisborough </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether Battersea power station can now be pulled down and pleasantly redeveloped.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, proposals for the future use of any site are a matter for the owner of the land concerned in the first instance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Does he agree that Battersea power station is an increasingly dilapidated eyesore across the river? Does he further agree that if someone were to apply for planning permission to build four 300-foot chimneys, it would quite rightly be thrown out, so there is little justification for keeping the ones that are there already? Furthermore, does my noble friend agree that now would be an apt time to remove listing from that building so that it can be redeveloped during the present period of fine architecture?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I can reassure my noble friend that the building is not in a dilapidated condition. In fact, English Heritage and the London Borough of Wandsworth monitor its condition closely. Both have the power either to issue a repairs notice or to require urgent works action should they believe it necessary. I can reassure my noble friend that the owners are carrying out repairs when the need arises. If my noble friend were to apply for permission to build four 300-foot towers, it is by no means certain that his application would be thrown out. Each application is judged on its merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, as it is current policy to pull down particularly ugly buildings, such as that belonging to the Department of the Environment and certain tower blocks, could not consideration also be given to demolishing this hideous and redundant power station which resembles an upturned table and is a particularly ugly blot on the landscape?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The noble Lord obviously does not enjoy the profile of Battersea power station. The Government believe that the building still has the special qualities which were held to justify its listing in the first place. No proposal for its delisting or demolition has been forwarded. But if one were, once again it would be judged on its merits initially by the London Borough of Wandsworth as the planning authority. What may bring the noble Lord some comfort is that the Government have recently announced that the public, including owners, are to be asked for their views before decisions are taken on whether some buildings should be listed. At first that will apply only to some 40 post-war buildings&#151;an exercise which is currently under way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Geddes: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend advise whether there are any procedures whereby, a building having been listed&#151;as in this Question, Battersea power station&#151;there can be an appeal against such listing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to consult my colleagues in the Department of National Heritage and write to my noble friend on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl said that the Government thought that Battersea power station had certain special qualities. Will he tell the House precisely what special qualities the Government think it has?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, it is a very fine example of a building of that type.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, is not the only list that Battersea power station ought to be on the list of buildings which should be demolished by high explosive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I would point out to my noble and learned friend that we are convinced that the building still has the special qualities that were held to justify its listing in the first place. Perhaps I may stress that the fact that a building is listed does not stop proposals coming forward to develop it, to delist it or to demolish it. Any such proposal will be treated on its merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, before any of those various drastic proposals are adopted, will the Government give serious consideration to restoring Battersea power station to its original use but using the most up-to-date technology? For example, would not it be a good idea to make it a combined heat and power station and, as its feed stock, use the refuse generated by the good people of Battersea?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the progress in this country of combined heat and power would be much worse than it is if it were not for the noble Lord and his fierce advocacy of it. All I can suggest is that he contacts the owners with that suggestion to see whether it fits in with the master plan which I believe they envisage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Wyatt of Weeford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that to many people not blinded by convention Battersea power station appears to be a remarkable and beautiful building?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, there is a wide body of people who would share the noble Lord's view. English Heritage monitors the value of that building and its surviving structure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that if the building were to be pulled down&#151;a building which was acquired from the CEGB by the present consortium for &#163;1.5 million&#151;that would represent a capital gain of some &#163;100 million to &#163;150 million to the present owners? That would be an unacceptable undertaking. Is not the right course to seek to have the present owners, or those who are about to acquire it, develop the site in such a way that it is sensitive to the interests of local people?

As for the noble Lord's arithmetic in the first part of his question, I will neither confirm nor deny it.

<P>

<A NAME="50614-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What were the circumstances under which Andersen Consulting was awarded the contract by the Department of Social Security to build the national insurance RS2 computer system and what criteria this decision was based on.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security   (Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish): </B>  My Lords, Andersen Consulting was awarded the contract by DSS to build and operate the national insurance recording system (NIRS2) following an advertised procurement conformant with UK public service contracts regulations.
<P>

<a name="50614-02_para0"></a>Award of contract was on the basis of the most economically advantageous offer, having regard to the business and technical suitability of the solution, overall value for money and contract price.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that detailed Answer. There are some disturbing features. The noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, asked a Question yesterday about the treatment of an individual. Does the Minister understand that it came out clearly that a person who worked for Arthur Andersen has been put almost in purdah while awaiting trial in the US courts? Will the Minister say why an individual can be victimised but not a company such as Arthur Andersen which did not come out of the Wessex Regional Health Authority fiasco smelling exactly of roses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I heard the exchanges on that subject yesterday between noble Lords and my noble friend Lord Henley. I have nothing to add, because, with all due respect, the subject is a little wide of the Question which has to do with the NIRS2 computer system for the DSS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the cost of computerising the benefits system has spiralled to &#163;2.6 billion&#151;four times the original estimate&#151;and, according to a recent independent Oxford University report, will not achieve any of the anticipated cost savings? Is the Minister aware that the report's author has said that the spend is in fact so large that the department has actually stopped counting it? Is that seemly at a time when the Government are unashamedly cutting benefits to disabled and unemployed people?
<P>


<a name="column_1791"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the department always counts the cost of all expenditure, including the expenditure proposed day by day by the noble Baroness in her contributions to debates on social security. As to her original question, I cannot confirm the exact figure, but I have seen something like that suggested. One of the premises upon which much of it is predicated is that some years ago when the department started computerising it made certain estimates of what it would cost to do the computer operations at that time. Computer technology has moved on. The number of things that we wish to do by computer has increased hugely and so the total cost of IT in a system which delivers about &#163;90 billion of benefits has increased considerably over the years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, further to my first Question, was previous performance considered in the award of the contract? If it was, why was a firm that behaved so appallingly badly in the Wessex Regional Health Authority fiasco awarded the contract, when there were other people available who could do it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, of course the DSS was well aware of the problems with the contract with the Wessex Regional Health Authority in the late 1980s and of the 63rd report of the PAC on that issue, but Andersen Consulting has done a number of jobs for the DSS and we have found its work satisfactory. It was one of three bidders at the final stages of the contract. Judgments were made by a team of people drawn up by the department, and by independent auditors who were brought in to audit the project at various stages. Its tender was considered to be the best. We consider that it is well able, given its previous track record with us, to carry out the contract.

<A NAME="50614-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, the Indian Government have now extended President's rule over the state of Jammu and Kashmir for six months from 18th July. They have made clear that they will try to hold state elections within that period. We would hope that such elections could provide a first step towards the genuine political process for which we have long called.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, if the Indian Government have been unable to stage elections during the five-and-a-half years of direct rule, and if at the end of that period approximately 5.5 million troops and paramilitaries are still in occupation of the territory and are committing serious abuses of human rights, why does the Minister have any confidence in the ability of the Indian Government to stage the elections during the next six months? Is she aware that every responsible leader of the people in the valley of Kashmir has denounced the elections and said that it is not possible to hold them under the Indian constitution because no one will take part?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I understand the noble Lord's difficulty in respect of this matter but without elections I cannot see that there will be any catalyst for the political process that is needed in Kashmir. Elections are a possible means to an end; they cannot possibly be an end in themselves. One can only speculate what other solutions might be available. However, looking at the difficulties and reading the Kashmir report of March and April this year, it is difficult to see in what way this matter can otherwise be resolved. The noble Lord knows that if he has any bright ideas they will be welcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that whether the elections are held or not, further attempts at confidence building between India and Pakistan are needed if progress is to be made in resolving the Kashmir problem? In the light of the worsening relations between the two countries since the destruction of the mosque at Charar-E-Sharief last month, what steps have the British Government taken to try to foster improved relations between the two countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the British Government deeply regret the destruction of the shrine and the loss of life. It may never be clear who was responsible. It was a tragedy that it should have happened. I agree with the noble Baroness about confidence building. That is why the Foreign Secretary discussed human rights in Kashmir with the Indian Foreign Minister as recently as 6th May and with the Pakistani Foreign Minister some time previously. We have also promoted a policy of openness with the delegation of the six European Union ambassadors who went to Kashmir in April and were given free access. Our High Commissioner in Delhi visited Kashmir at the end of May. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also visited Kashmir recently. We are discussing with the ICRC a possible role in Kashmir and we hope that that will be agreed soon. We are looking for many ways of building confidence so that the Kashmiris might resolve their problems in a peaceful way.

<A NAME="50614-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that on numerous occasions I have made suggestions to her colleague, Mr. Tony Baldry? They consist of an alternative to the electoral process, which is the encouragement and facilitation of a dialogue among the people of Kashmir so that they can express their opinions on the kind of constitutional status to which the territory should aspire. Does the noble Baroness agree that with half a million troops and paramilitaries in the territory, and with severe restrictions on freedom of speech, it is not possible to engage in such a dialogue and that the Indians should be persuaded to demilitarise the territory and to restore freedom of speech so that the Kashmiris can express their opinions?

<A NAME="50614-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, this is an extremely intractable problem because it is not a question simply of getting people within Kashmir to sit down and talk peaceably together. I have no doubt that if it were, it would have long since happened. I believe that the encouragement of dialogue within the Kashmir area is necessary. That dialogue must lead to a resolution of the problems. If the Kashmiris are united in their wish to secede from India, the difficulty is that they are far from united in what should happen after secession. That is the problem. There is a sharp division between those who support accession to Pakistan and those who want independence. There are some who actually want a link with India. Until those main groups can resolve their differences it is difficult for anyone from outside, with or without troops, to impose a solution.

<P>

<a name="50614-03_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. We in this country are very good at many things. One of them is not always fully appreciating what we are good at and where we have been successful. So in today's debate it would be worth looking at one sector where the United Kingdom, together with the United States, has led the <P>


<a name="column_1794"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1794</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>world in the development of new technology, specifically in the field of information. It promises an exciting future for our country.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para3"></a>The two significant factors in the UK's success have been, first, the use of English as a commercial language in vast areas of the world and, secondly and importantly, government programmes implementing privatisation and liberalisation policies initiated more than 10 years ago. As regards Europe, for instance, except for the UK, Sweden and Finland, all member states' telecommunications operations are state monopolies without the benefit of competition. One comparative figure indicates the kind of situation that has arisen. As regards what we call "PCs", there are 34 per 100 citizens in the United States and 22 per 100 citizens in the United Kingdom. However, in the rest of Europe the average is 10 per 100 citizens.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para4"></a>We must ensure that Britain continues to hold a leading position in what has developed not only into a European but a global market. As the sector expands rapidly, there is an increasing influence on the lifestyles of individuals, on career opportunities and on a completely new approach to the problems of daily life; for instance, shopping, banking, publications, home-based offices, ways of obtaining information and reception of entertainment available on screen.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para5"></a>In many instances distance has now become irrelevant. Availability of information at the touch of a button applies equally to researchers at university, access to databases on a wide range of matters and, for example, even consultation with medical specialists who are perhaps several hundred miles away advising on appropriate diagnosis and medical treatment. These dramatic changes resulting from new achievements and advances pose new problems in public policy, in standards&#151;both moral and technical&#151;in the need for legal measures, in the conflict between twin principles of freedom of expression and protection of privacy, and have to be considered if people are to reap benefits from these changes, so that we can see social and economic progress and avoid possible ill effects and consequences through failure to discuss and debate these issues. While the industrial revolution of over 150 years ago, which Britain then led, altered the way in which people lived, we did not always remain in the lead and there were negative as well as positive results. We are now going through another more complex revolution in which millions of people are taking part and are being affected by it. Anyone who acquires a computer, a telephone line and a modem can open up a new world of information, communication and entertainment, hitherto undreamed of.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para6"></a>The opportunity for free and open debate enables us to put our views to the Government. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Ferrers for answering on the Government's behalf, recognising, of course, that only a few of those issues can be touched on in the time available.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para7"></a>To understand some of the technical problems involved, thanks should be expressed to the excellent Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) publication Information Superhighways, or the National Information Infrastructure, just published. The clear division between telecommunication services identified by the great success of BT since its privatisation and the <P>


<a name="column_1795"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1795</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cable services, which have enabled the cable operators to develop their field of operation, has so far proved to be successful. What must now be considered is whether that separation should continue in the future if those big UK companies are to become major players on the European and global markets.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para8"></a>If there was unrestricted entry for telecommunications operators into the broadcasting market, the ability of cable networks to invest and compete in the telecommunications market would be put at risk. That has so far not been of great concern to the major European PTTs, but as they become privatised they will also be faced with the issue that has faced the UK. Any decision will affect the investment policies of the private sector as, no doubt, in the not so distant future, there will be a general convergence of the use of networks. The excellent report Europe and the Global Information Society&#151;Recommendations to the Council launched by Commissioner Bangemann in June 1994 at the Corfu summit has already proved to be a stimulus for member states and a guide to the way forward in advancing information technology at European level, including&#151;and I list some of the main points set out in the report&#151;liberalisation of the telecom sector, achievement and preservation of universal service and the internal market principles of free movement and the conclusion that deployment and financing of an information infrastructure will be the primary responsibility of the private sector. That is a conclusion to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para9"></a>In this development the UK plays an important role, already well ahead of other member states. No doubt based on Britain's example, European policy is directed to liberalisation of telecommunications infrastructure by, at the latest, 1st January 1998. What is an essential accompaniment to that policy is liberalisation of the services which accompany the infrastructures, such as access to directories and databases. Those who are involved in Community law will know the difficulties of unstitching links between former companies which have held monopolies in certain member states in order to get directories published freely by individual companies.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para10"></a>It is in the UK interest to continue to press for liberalisation in services and telecommunications markets. The removal of the monopoly situations of the PTTs on the Continent should have one beneficial effect; it will contribute to the lowering of prices, as pointed out in the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee's third report of July 1994. In its annual report, BT endorses that view.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para11"></a>One interesting development, following the restrictions imposed on BT to confine its activities to telecommunications and not to be involved in cable infrastructure, has been the effect that that has had on its development into other European markets and as its annual reports says, it has now got a significant presence in many European countries. This year it had a turnover of &#163;313 billion.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para12"></a>Of the many legal issues arising, competition policy needs close scrutiny. It is no use in a global market to attack the dominant position of one player in a national field. To encourage and attract private investment, the opportunities for companies to establish successful niches at least at European level are essential, if they are to <P>


<a name="column_1796"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1796</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieve world rank. Linkage and co-operation with other European companies, particularly with the companies emerging from the present existing monopolies, are a way forward, and it is hoped that BT will follow that route.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para13"></a>The legal aspects of data protection, the right to privacy and intellectual property rights are all matters which, while being based on national law, will benefit by being adapted not only to standard European rules but ultimately to international rules agreed within the terms of the World Trade Organisation but with monitoring and enforcement being left to national courts.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para14"></a>Who are the users of this vast web of new technological equipment and what are their benefits? We can consider customers, businesses, institutions, and individuals because they will all be affected by this new development. Internet, the worldwide network of computers linked by telephone, already has about 3 million subscribers in the UK alone and an estimated 30-100 million subscribers worldwide. Access to information is made easier, and can be used to provide information on government documents, reports, forms and fulfil other requirements of the ordinary citizen. It is hoped that the Government may eventually extend their processes of giving information and enabling access to statutes, parliamentary debates and so on as are now available on the European database networks. That could give an impetus to increasing the number of users and the sale of equipment. Minitel, originally launched with the free distribution of mini computers to a large number of individuals in France, is now a common method of getting information on, for example, air and railway timetables, which would be of great benefit to those of us who have to travel and try to get through to railway station inquiries.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para15"></a>Internet has also become a source of entertainment and that is an area which needs, if it is possible, some kind of regulatory control. If Channel 4, with a programme advertised daily to the public, can show the kind of so-called entertainment such as the programmes recently severely and rightly condemned&#151;"The Last Temptation of Christ" and "The Word"&#151;it is to be wondered what kind of programmes are being shown on Internet, basically only known to those who plug into the line. Journalistic reports have highlighted recently the appalling kind of material being circulated on Internet&#151;both pornographic and scenes of violence. Measures for blocking general access to this kind of material are clearly needed. If that is not a governmental or legal possibility, it is a technological matter which must be studied seriously.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para16"></a>Another aspect of concern relating to the use of Internet is its availability for political propaganda, be it party politics or the spreading of ideas on, for example, race, immigration or other sensitive areas of our public policies. I understand that it is sometimes used for those purposes. One issue the Government must be considering is the use of party political programmes during election campaigns and how far those can be controlled by current legislation or whether amendments are needed to that legislation. Technological progress clearly has its down side.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para17"></a>There are two more areas on which it might be helpful to touch. The first is fundamental to the future of our society; namely, educational opportunity and the availability of skills in the technological field. The <P>


<a name="column_1797"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1797</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imaginative programmes introduced by a Conservative Government a few years ago&#151;the introduction of computers to schools so that pupils were given the opportunity to acquire computer practice&#151;should be revised. I should say to the DFE that recent computer models with modern software applications should be made widely available throughout our schools. It is an expensive investment but it would be a good investment for the young and their future job opportunities. The adaptation of distance learning as a means of communicating and teaching classes of different levels of ability would also bring many advantages.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para18"></a>While technological progress is to be applauded, it brings its problems. The rapid advances in recent years are not necessarily reflected in the creation of new jobs, resulting in a decline in unemployment. The level of technical skills required become ever higher, and competition in design and software has become intense. There is not only an economic side&#151;for example, more efficient business management&#151;but a social aspect, which government should not ignore. As a contribution to the beneficial aspects of the new technology in the social field, local authorities should be looking at how, for example, computers can help the housebound, by reason of age or disability. There will be many disadvantages such as lack of human contact, as well as advantages. But that should not stop the issues being examined closely.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para19"></a>In a subject of this kind with its vast implications, I have not sought to dwell on the basic technical aspects, such as interoperability, interconnection between services, or even the obvious need for appropriate regulatory frameworks and the development of broad-band infrastructures. Those have been discussed fully in the Trade and Industry Committee's third report on optical fibre networks of 1993-94 and each would need lengthy discussion and analysis. But I mention those as an example of the aspects which need to be looked at in the coming months and years.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para20"></a>Another important aspect not to be overlooked is the full participation of the United Kingdom in the European Union's &#163;1,000 million IVth Framework programme in research and development. There are many noble Lords who have considerable expert scientific knowledge and will be making very valuable contributions to this subject not only today but also on other occasions.
<P>

<a name="50614-03_para21"></a>This short debate may provide some thoughts for the Government, and some thoughts for the future, that we should not overlook the political, social and economic impact that this new information society will have on individuals&#151;a new way of life, new opportunities and for many an easier existence&#151;while ensuring that our own country maintains the lead it has already acquired in what is now a global market. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, for giving us the opportunity today to discuss what is clearly a very important topic for British society and also for British business. There is little doubt that the changes now taking place will present and do present an enormous <P>


<a name="column_1798"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1798</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity for us, provided they are grasped and provided we have policies which enable the full development of the potential of this revolution. It is a revolution which has changed and will change society. In years to come we will look back and not be able to imagine life without it. It will change the way we work&#151;it is doing that now; it will change the way we communicate with each other; and it will change the way we educate our young people and indeed our adult people as well.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para0"></a>We have a tremendous advantage in that the English language is one of the major assets of this technology. The noble Baroness mentioned the Internet. It is the one area that is most talked about but it is by no means the sole area of this development. Internet is totally dominated by text conveyed in the English language. So there are opportunities that we need to grasp. There may not be the large number of new jobs that we would want to see but there will be a major contribution in terms of employment.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para1"></a>I come from an industry&#151;the printing industry&#151;which has seen major change. As a result of this information society the publishing industry is seeing phenomenal change. I was told that in the 15th century the Vatican had 400 books. Today, 25,000 books are already loaded in digital form via the information society, and that is just the tip of it. The convergence of technology will mean new on-line entertainment and information services. They will be delivered via the telephone line and they will carry large amounts of data, including moving images&#151;I shall return to that point shortly&#151;sound, text, still pictures, graphics, or any combination of those which the individual needs to access. They are likely to include virtual reality&#151;straight into your home&#151;and home shopping. People will be able to key into a computer and actually see the goods not just in one dimension but in multi-dimensional ways. There will be home education and video on demand. The opportunities are enormous.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para2"></a>The new services will bring increased choice, control and interactivity. There will be implications for wide sectors. In education, children will no longer need to be told about art galleries or need to look at books about art galleries. They will be able go into the virtual reality computer and actually see the art galleries. I accept that that is no substitute for children visiting the galleries individually; but if they do not have that opportunity, as many children do not, it is at least a substitute, albeit perhaps a poor one.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para3"></a>The combination of sound, text and images will enable goods to be sold in a new way. That in itself will bring challenges. For instance, it is possible today to put on the Internet a sophisticated advertisement that will reach approximately 30 million people worldwide for a fraction of the amount which at present one would have to pay to a national newspaper to reach the United Kingdom's population.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para4"></a>There are enormous opportunities; but there are also some anxieties which we have to address. I wish to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, on touching upon the social implications and the need perhaps for some regulation in this area. Reports from government bodies, other groups and from the European Commission all deal with the economic factors&#151;liberalisation, <P>


<a name="column_1799"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1799</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>competition and investment&#151;but they do not deal with the potential social implications. One of the criteria that we should lay down is that there must be universal access to these new developments. Otherwise, we shall divide our society between the "haves" and "have-nots".
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para5"></a>Many of us have heard the funny story that if you want to know about a computer ask the eight year-old in your own home. A recent survey conducted by NOP and published this week showed that a third of the users of the Internet are on salaries of more than &#163;25,000 a year; that a third of the users are women; and that two-thirds are aged over 25. We are already seeing the divisions to which I referred, and so universal access is crucial. Under the BT licence there must be access to a telephone for anyone who wants it. However, the same conditions do not apply to the broadcasting media. Access to cable television depends on where one lives and whether it is economic to provide it. If we are looking at the good of the nation, that is an area which we need to consider.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para6"></a>The pornography that is available is one area of concern. I must declare an interest. I am chairman of ICSSTIS, which regulates the premium rate telephone sector, a small industry in telecommunications&#151;a new one, only a decade old. It goes back to the liberalisation of telecommunications in the United Kingdom. When it was first launched, 70 per cent. of the industry was in pornography services. It has been through the effective self-regulation of those services and now pornography services are below 3 per cent. of the weekly 5 million calls to premium rate services, which has allowed the growth of good, added value services. That is because regulation was put in place post-liberalisation, as Parliament did not think it necessary to put it in place at the time of liberalisation. Regulation is necessary to protect vulnerable groups and to protect standards that as a society we quite rightly demand.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para7"></a>People say that you can use Internet, that you do not have to pay for the service but just pay the subscription and that money is not there to be made. Is it not a funny old world when the first service that is going to make a profit, it is said, is Playboy magazine, which recorded some 500,000 telephone calls via the Internet within one 24-hour period? No regulation, no controls, 500,000 calls within 24 hours! I am not saying that people should not be able to access that service if they choose to do so. I am not putting myself up as any kind of moral crusader. What I am saying is that in the whole area of the Internet we have to have some gateways which mean that people do not have those services if they do not want them. It is said that 82 per cent. of homes now either have a computer or have access to one. We do not want to see children using these services.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para8"></a>It is said that the premium rate sector was the first interactive sector in the UK. As chairman of ICSSTIS over the past few years, I can tell the House that we have been able to stop some of the material with which we have had to deal only because regulation is in place. I suggest to your Lordships that effective regulation is essential. I do not seek in any way to discourage the opportunities which exist; we need to encourage them, but already school personnel are saying, "We will not access Internet; we are afraid of what our children may <P>


<a name="column_1800"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1800</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stumble across". That is a bad development. We need a Kitemark or some kind of code; regulation which is effective but not heavy-handed&#151;perhaps self-regulation&#151;which will ensure that people obtain the services they want and that the system is legal, honest and decent. We must ensure that when people use the information super highway they do not become trapped in scams. We have heard this week of some such incidents involving the purchase of goods. The Stock Exchange is extremely concerned about price sensitive information entering the Internet system as that information could distort the markets.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para9"></a>What we are now seeing is a whole series of anxieties emerging through people's practical experiences of using these new services. If there were a public reaction against this system, that would be detrimental to the use of this equipment which represents the biggest opportunity we have had for a long time to take our society forward. Suppliers and service providers would, I suggest, welcome effective regulation&#151;perhaps not statutory&#151;that would ensure that the services meet people's expectations.

<P>
<A NAME="50614-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cockfield: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, in thanking my noble friend Lady Elles for giving us the opportunity of discussing a subject which is not only important today but will be of growing importance as the years go by. I have a specific interest in this in the sense that I was asked last year by the Federal Trust, which is an educational charity specialising in European affairs, to take the chair of a study group dealing with the information society. The group consists of people from industry, banking, finance, commerce and the universities, as well as senior people from the European Commission itself. It has also the advantage that, apart from me, it has in its membership no politicians with the baggage they inevitably carry around with them.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para10"></a>The group is due to present its report next month, on 18th July. It is intended to be a contribution to education in this field and it also discusses the major policy issues which are involved; that is, regulation and competition, the setting of standards and the public policy issues of the kind that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, mentioned, as well as financial issues. When I undertook the chairmanship of this body I said that I knew nothing whatever about the subject and I regarded my function as solely one of keeping order at the meetings. Nine months later, on the point of publishing the report, I realise how deep is my lack of knowledge on these matters and how much there is still to be learnt. In the light of that I wish to put two points only to your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para11"></a>The first is this. It was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Elles. In the 18th and 19th century this country was the leader in what we now call the first Industrial Revolution, and it was the enormous power which we generated as the leader of the Industrial Revolution which underlay the prosperity and greatness of this country in the Victorian era and which to some extent has persisted to this very day. When the second Industrial Revolution started in the 1970s with the <P>


<a name="column_1801"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1801</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development of electronic and digital techniques, and particularly data processing, unfortunately both Europe as a whole and, indeed, this country fell seriously behind compared with the United States and later with Japan. There is one statistic which has been quoted on many an occasion which underlines this, and that is that in that decade Europe accounted for some 30 per cent. of the demand but only 10 per cent. of the supply. We are now embarking on the second phase of the second Industrial Revolution with the development of what Al Gore, the American Vice-President, described as the information super highway, which has now been broadened out into the concept of the information society.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para12"></a>Europe as a whole, and indeed this country, lags behind the United States. The figures quoted by my noble friend Lady Elles for the number of personal computers per head of the population shows that. We have not fallen behind quite as much as the rest of Europe but nevertheless both Europe and ourselves are lagging behind the United States. We are lagging behind Japan and we are lagging behind the other countries of the Far East. It is not too late now to make good the gap. We have to be determined that we will make good the gap. It will require a massive effort not only in this country but in Europe as a whole.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para13"></a>The second point that I want to make leads directly from that. There are a series of problems, and these issues have to be tackled on a pan-European basis, not just by this country or just by the European Union but by the greater Europe, including the countries of central and eastern Europe which we hope to see within the European Union by the end of this century. This is true for two specific reasons. The first is that data processing&#151;the transmission of information by digital or electronic forms&#151;the information super highway, is no respecter of frontiers. That has been brought out in the not very happy example of the way that Internet has been misused, although we ought not to concentrate so much on the misuse of Internet as the enormous opportunities it opens up. However, this kind of development is no respecter of frontiers.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para14"></a>Secondly, the critical mass required is such that there is no country in Europe, neither this country nor Germany nor any other country, which can provide the critical mass needed for this kind of development. That is why it must be done on a pan-European basis.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para15"></a>My final point is that the attitude of our United Kingdom Government has been entirely constructive. It is important, indeed critical, that it should remain so, not only in the interests of Europe as a whole but, above all, in the interests of this country as well.

It must be a matter for pride and satisfaction that as a country we have been in the van of the development and application of high <P>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1802</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>technology and artificial intelligence, and it has all moved so fast and with such profound results for our society.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para16"></a>When I went to Somerville in 1980 the college did not even have an electric typewriter, let alone a computer. But by the time I returned in 1989 we had computerised most of our operations and IBM and ICL had both attached distinguished young women to us for three years each to promote academic work in the field of information technology in its applications to psychology and engineering respectively. Both IBM and ICL had endowed us generously with the computers that we needed for both undergraduates and graduates.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para17"></a>Since I have always believed strongly in opportunities for women (Somerville was then a women's college) in management in industry, the college held an annual open evening for industry at which chief executives and chairmen of ICI, GEC, IBM, Shell and many other companies met the whole of the second year. The first time that happened several undergraduates who were reading philosophy or classics came to me and said that they would come but they doubted whether they had anything to offer industry, or vice versa. I told them that a training in logic and the structure of language was an excellent preparation for work in the field of artificial intelligence. The next year a young women with a first in maths and philosophy went on to an exacting and challenging job in ICL. I hope that that story may help to establish my bona fides as a supporter of information technology, for I myself am hopelessly computer illiterate.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para18"></a>I shall tell the House of my experience when speaking on what I later discovered to be a conference telephone line to New York. I was asked by the young man at the other end of the telephone whether I would agree to speak at the Oxford and Cambridge dinner. I said, "Gladly". He said that I was only the second woman who had done that. From the background came, clearly unaware that he was heard, the voice of the chairman saying, "Yes, and a bloody bad choice that was!". I hope noble Lords will excuse my language.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para19"></a>I know that the world has made a quantum leap in terms of the power to communicate. When I sat on the British Library Board I had to learn at once that we were not dealing only with books, those familiar friends, but with a whole new world that could send a text from Finland to Saudi Arabia through a computer network. When I went to the Royal Commission for the Historical Monuments of England I saw how the text, colour and texture of stonework, stained glass and tessellated pavements could be transmitted through imaging so that a scholar need no longer travel many miles to browse through boxes of photographs. During my time as a governor the BBC was at the forefront of communications technology. I hope that that is still the case.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para20"></a>What concerns me, like many others, is the social impact of all this amazing new knowledge. Much of it, perhaps most of it, is good. I remember a professor of engineering science, a doughty friend and supporter, telling me that his first reaction had been dismay when he learnt that two key members of his research team were each expecting a child. He then remembered the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>new X-factor, the computer. They both worked at home for the first year, with regular visits to the department to compare notes with the team. They did splendid work and were able to enjoy being mothers. Steve Shirley, that remarkable woman, built her highly successful business on the same principle of computers at home. All that is good. What are the causes of concern?
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para21"></a>One must be, how does society adjust to a world where great enterprises find it both cheaper and more effective to replace large numbers of semi-skilled and even skilled workers by computers controlled by a handful of high-tech experts and where banks replace men and women with computers? What do those people and their sons and daughters do? They cannot all become computer literate high-flyers. What are the educational, social and economic implications? Will this situation create a climate of bewildered misery and resentment which might breed a new generation of Lollards, or will it create a society where small numbers of people have intensely demanding and satisfying work while others play endless computer games?
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para22"></a>That leads me to my next anxiety. Information technology is open to great abuses such as the Internet. This ought to be a wonderful exercise in crossing frontiers and shrinking the world. But, as the noble Baroness has already said, it can as easily be used and exploited by paedophile rings and violent groups. Another anxiety must be that our passion for transparency and the proliferation of databases worldwide means that the hacker can threaten our privacy and our security and truth can become a casualty.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para23"></a>In a recent case a surgeon altered the data held on a number of patients in order to support his spurious claim to have made a breakthrough in his professional field of research. There have been frightening examples of the introduction of computer viruses into vital and irreplaceable records of, for instance, blind patients in a hospital. Not least, I wonder whether Nick Leeson of Barings could have lost the millions he did if he had not been for some years free to play a kind of financial Star Wars game in which he lost touch with reality.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para24"></a>Another example of the extremely vulnerable nature of a society where records are more and more likely to be held in a computer is that given in a recent debate on Northern Ireland in the other place, where it was said that there was reason to believe that the IRA was accessing records which would enable it to target people. It was said that:

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Butterworth: </B>   My Lords, I wish to add my thanks to my noble friend Lady Elles for giving us this opportunity this afternoon to look at the new revolution. I also wish to associate myself with what my noble friend Lord Cockfield had to say; namely, that the health of British industry depends upon our being able to establish ourselves in new and sophisticated industries, of which telecommunications and other activities generated by the information society are excellent examples.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para27"></a>One point on which I do not find myself in agreement with my noble friend is when he tries to restrict those activities and say that they are pan-European. If information technology is no respecter of boundaries, then it must logically follow that Europe cannot be as important as he suggested. Information technology is global and international. It is against that background that we must make our plans.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para28"></a>As has been said, the United States are already well advanced in industrial policy in their national information infrastructure, which Al Gore characterised as the information superhighway. POST, in its recent report, sees a national information infrastructure as a significant contender for national economic and technological competitiveness and also as the essential agent for this revolution, improving healthcare, education, training and the like and the delivery of governmental and public services.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para29"></a>Less than 10 years ago it was assumed that an information highway, which was interactive and broad-band, could only be created by an optical fibre network. However, technological advances within the past few years have shown how existing competitive networks in this and other countries can be successfully adapted and, by modest enhancements such as digital compression, can supply all the needs of customers, as they are foreseen at present.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para30"></a>While some still argue that the superhighway cannot be achieved until all work places, households, educational centres and leisure facilities are wired up to a broad band fibre network, others see the existing networks being used by more sophisticated technological developments, and believe that indeed there may well now be no need for the so-called single national superhighway. However, all are agreed that to provide that form of communication ahead of consumer demand would prove a very poor investment indeed. On the other hand, failure to provide the infrastructure in phase with developments would block and damage the whole process.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para31"></a>It is considerations such as these which lead naturally to the problems of regulation. Here I have some embarrassment and must confess an interest because my daughter is the Deputy Director-General of Oftel. However, regulation is so fundamental in this field that I am sure we must tackle it in the debate today.
<P>


<a name="column_1805"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1805</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para32"></a>Oftel's statutory role is confined to regulations of the telecommunications system and the telecommunication market in the United Kingdom. On one view, Oftel's aim of developing innovative services through competition could set up a regime of efficient competition in the UK which nevertheless might deprive major British companies of the experience needed to enable them to compete successfully against their Japanese and American counterparts.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para33"></a>On the other hand, if the information society can be realised through the existing networks, and if a single national superhighway proves not to be necessary, the key problem today would be to achieve what is now called "open networks"&#151;that is to say, interconnections and interoperability between existing and present networks so that there is open access for all service providers to all customers on all networks. However, it is the case that in the short term the networks and services may need to be protected until they have established themselves and some limitation on the service providers' right of access may be necessary to enable new markets to be established.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para34"></a>Finally, the convergence between telecommunications and entertainment may have implications for the regulatory process itself. Oftel is responsible for telecommunications and, as I have sought to explain, setting the framework for competition. The Independent Television Commission is the licensing authority for broadcast entertainment. It may be helpful if the Minister were able to tell us when a review of those current responsibilities is likely to take place and whether we ought to look forward to a situation in which we have a single "Office of Communications" which would combine the existing regulatory responsibilities of both the ITC and Oftel.

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, like every other noble Lord who has spoken, I am most grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to this important and exciting topic.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para35"></a>The development of the information society has been and is an outstanding success in the United Kingdom. IT is a huge business. Not everyone realises the full implications of the developments to date nor is capable of comprehending the ongoing potential. The success of the development of the information society is not always recognised. Indeed, in this country, too often we tend to adopt the stance of being "gifted amateurs" and prefer to give the impression that we like muddling through. The description of someone as a "computer whizz kid" is somewhat derisory.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para36"></a>Sadly, there is a head-in-the-sand attitude among certain sectors of society; and I would not even exclude the House of Lords from that category because last night a comment was made about "playing with one's laptop". Indeed, our captains of industry think that computers are for their workers rather than to be used by them, as captains of industry. Herein lies a potential problem; it has been touched on briefly. I fear that the problems recently experienced in banking in the Far East have come about through a lack of complete comprehension <P>


<a name="column_1806"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1806</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by those at the top who are empowered to run the business of the whole derivatives market, and how computers can access and work in it.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para37"></a>The stance of being regarded as gifted amateurs still seems attractive. However, the people involved in the industry&#151;it is an industry&#151;are far from gifted amateurs playing with laptops. They are highly skilled professionals who have developed information technology in such a way as to give world leadership to the United Kingdom. It is not strange that the United Kingdom has been in the forefront of this development. Our children seem to have inherent engineering skills from an early age. However, they are then sadly diverted into areas which will lead to socially acceptable careers in the professions. There is still this stigma attached to engineering, to making things, and to business in general. For example, my family was appalled because I was the first member of the family not to embrace a career in the professions.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para38"></a>However, these latent skills are not necessarily lost for ever. Many people in the professions are now developing IT skills which draw heavily on the technical and analytical skills which they had as children and which, until the development of the information society, only manifested themselves in a compulsive addiction to DIY, with head under the car bonnet for most of the weekend, and messing about in boats in the marina&#151;not necessarily on the water.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para39"></a>Of course, the information society is technology based, but it is useless without thinking&#151;without analytical and mathematical ability. Those are cerebral skills as opposed to technical skills. Therefore I am optimistic that with our ability on both fronts we can develop still further the application of IT in almost every activity of business and commerce.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para40"></a>In the debate I shall deal solely with business. That is where my experience lies. I am sure that others will deal with medicine. We have already had a good contribution about science. Others will deal with education.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para41"></a>The development of IT has been apparent for many years, but there is still a great deal of development which is either taken for granted as a natural evolutionary process of technical development or is not publicised. Information is the new raw material of our age. It is an increasing, not a diminishing, resource. Strictly speaking, data are the raw material. The skill is in converting data to information.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para42"></a>The UK is a world leader in adding value to the underlying technology to deliver business solutions in many areas of business. It is the skill of our people which gives us the edge in applying that technology. My noble friend Lady Elles has already referred to Internet; but I have heard it said that the information superhighway will be as important to us in the near future as road and rail have been in the past.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para43"></a>I thought it might be useful in the debate to draw on my knowledge acquired not only in my main business career but as a non-executive director of Tesco, for the purposes of the debate. It is not a PR exercise because I am sure that other companies in the grocery distribution business are also deeply involved, but facts are always useful in a debate such as this.
<P>


<a name="column_1807"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1807</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para44"></a>Without IT, it would not be possible for Tesco to run the business which now has a total of over 5 million order lines processed per day. In that business in the past 10 years, stockholding has been reduced from 4.8 weeks to 2.4 weeks&#151;a 50 per cent. reduction. That has coincided with an improvement in service level from depot to store from 92 per cent. to 98.5 per cent. We often compare ourselves with the United States and have already heard that the average number of computers per 100 of the population is about 50 per cent. higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom. However, interestingly enough, in the grocery business the average number of days' stock in the chain in the United States is 104; in Tesco it is 28. That brings enormous benefits. It is a technical point, but it improves customer service and results in a reduction in working capital tied up in stock. Those are just two points.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para45"></a>The customers do not realise how IT is having an impact on their business. They see the scanning&#151;the only outward sign of a huge backup operation. Data taken from scanning goes straight into stock control, which in turn becomes orders for new stock.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para46"></a>That has led to electronic trading via electronic data interchange (EDI). Over 95 per cent. of the orders go via EDI. Tesco alone has over 1,300 suppliers linked into the system, which happens to be the largest electronic community in Europe.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para47"></a>There is yet another factual comparison with other countries, which is interesting. Tesco acquired two overseas businesses recently: one in France and one in Hungary. In France, only 25 per cent. of the volume is based on EDI, compared with 95 per cent. here; in Hungary, the depot throughput for a full week is processed by one depot in one hour in this country. On any mathematical scale, the advances are almost incapable of being measured.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para48"></a>This is not a soulless business; it is not an automaton-driven situation. Computers without people inputting&#151;to use computer jargon&#151;will put out nothing. We always used to hear, when we started learning about computers, "rubbish in, rubbish out". The data out is only as good as the human who is putting the data in. The inexorable rise of IT does not mean large scale job losses, necessarily, particularly if we take the initiative and export our know-how to other countries that are still a long way behind.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para49"></a>Technology for technology's sake may be interesting and fun but it is not the subject for consideration in this debate. The benefits of IT are as much taken for granted as are the advances in many other walks of life. Without IT, customers would not have the choice, freshness of product or the rapid reaction to their demands.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para50"></a>From till receipts, information is gathered about preferred sizes, daily buying habits and preferred brands. The list is endless. It is only through IT that the customer really benefits. In the future, information will be much more readily available. Less time on non-productive information gathering means more time for analysis, which should lead to better decision making in every line of business. There are benefits for all businesses, not just the grocery business.
<P>


<a name="column_1808"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1808</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para51"></a>I should like to speak briefly about another quite different business; namely, the success of PACE Micro Technology, which is a Yorkshire based company and is a world leader in the development of digital pay-TV receivers. This is information technology in a totally different sphere, but one that has both great potential for the UK and great benefit for the consumer. PACE is one of a handful of companies world wide with the ability to design and manufacture digital equipment using a new compression standard (MPEG2) for all types of digital broadcast transmission format, including satellite, cable and terrestrial. This company has developed the digital technology and is now able to capitalise still further on its original developments. PACE is probably an apt name for the company&#151;it is proceeding at a cracking pace. Over the last few weeks, the company has signed four major deals in the Australian, South African and Far East markets.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para52"></a>Those are just typical of the opportunities which are currently being exploited. More&#151;much more&#151;can and will be achieved. Why am I so optimistic? Despite our self-flagellation, we have great resources of human ability in this country. In the area of IT, one just has to look at how children have taken to it. They, unlike me, do not require manuals. They take to computers like ducks to water. Computers are used as tools in schools; as toys at home. Children will not be fazed by the huge leaps in technological development; they will be leading it. What we must do is encourage them and everyone to embrace the modern technology&#151;and on a personal level I can assure your Lordships that productivity and efficiency can certainly improve by a factor of at least four.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para53"></a>We must take the issue seriously. IT is a serious business, a wonderful adjunct to modern life, and a huge opportunity for the UK, both now and in the future. We should all be most grateful to my noble friend Lady Elles for drawing our attention to it.

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renwick: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to my noble friend Lady Elles for the opportunity today to talk about the information society in all its ramifications. I am delighted that during the course of this fascinating debate it is becoming evident that we are speaking of the information society in the present. It is with us now, whether we like it or not. The Internet is up and running, it is growing by 10 per cent. a month. By about the year 2010 more people will be involved with or connected to the Internet than the total population of the world! Statistics are never quite right.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para54"></a>The information society is here now and we are using it. I am connected to it through the Parliamentary Data and Video Network. I see the noble Lord, Lord Peston, nodding, I followed his example. I must admit that when I was first lent the equipment, I was rather worried about the font used for printing. It looked to me like yesterday's font and I found it difficult to read. I asked for New Times Roman or something more up to date. "Oh, no", said the wonderful people who helped me, "that will totally disrupt the software that you have on your computer". I felt that asking for Times Roman within three weeks of having used a quill pen was <P>


<a name="column_1809"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1809</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>slightly offensive to them, but anyhow I got my New Times Roman. I find that what I write on my keyboard comes out through my printer as presentable copy. I cannot read my speech because my handwritten notes are so bad that I find it difficult to read them. However, now, for the first time, I am in control.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para55"></a>That experience may be replicated with hundreds of thousands of school children when they are first taught the elements of literacy. Think of the disappointment they had with the product of their pen and their joined-up writing, with the awful boredom to trying to decipher the squiggles on the pads at school at the ages of six, seven or eight. Now an astonishing change takes place when a child is given a keyboard. As we have heard, children take to the keyboard like a duck takes to water. There is the excitement of avoiding the difficulty they have in absorbing the written symbols as a reference, with the text coming out on the screen. The children are able to press a button and see their work printed out. They take pride in it, they want to replicate it.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para56"></a>I must declare an interest, I am involved as a council member of the National Council for Educational Technology, I have a three-year term. That body is doing a wonderful job in applying technology to the education system through many processes and working programmes. One of them looks into the value of integrated learning systems, which are another product of the information society. That programme is now up and running and is under evaluation by NCET. It is a machine by means of which a child has an individually designed education programme on which he or she spends 10 or 20 minutes a day. Those children look forward to that time face to face with their computer. They start where they left off the day before. They mark themselves, or they are assessed, and they take pride in achieving a better mark today than they did yesterday.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para57"></a>Then there is the experience of networking in classrooms. I visited a primary school on the West Coast of America. It was in an area where the quality of life was so low that the children were given breakfast at school as well as lunch. It was a school of 600 primary pupils. It had networked two classrooms with equipment provided by local industry (and, in one case&#151;a higher secondary school&#151;the local authority). That had completely changed the atmosphere in the school. Those children had had a truancy rate of some 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. It was down to nil. The parent-teacher involvement in that area had been nothing. It rose to between 80 per cent. and 90 per cent. just five to six months after the introduction of networking, with keyboards and a monitor, one to every two children. Strangely, handwriting had improved throughout the school, in spite of the enormous ability to use the keyboard. Their greatest ambition was to become connected to the Internet. I hope that that has been done now.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para58"></a>I am involved in other operations, purely at a steering committee level. One is Project Connect, a project to connect seven schools in the Leicestershire area to the Internet. One is in Hillingdon&#151;just to show that distance is no object; as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said, distance is irrelevant now. It is a six-months' pilot trial to <P>


<a name="column_1810"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1810</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put those schools on the Internet through a college of higher education, in this case De Montfort University, and another school of higher education. We also use an integrated learning system that will be flexible enough to bring in the Internet, but graduated and controlled so that the problems of pornography and that sort of thing are avoided. In six months' time we shall see how that pilot study is going. My initial information is that it has had an effect in those schools across the board that is very similar to the experience of networking in the United States. It represents quite a massive investment by local and national industries. Therefore, nationally, it will mean quite a heavy investment on the part of schools.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para59"></a>From the business point of view, obviously the information society is important. As my noble friend Lord Butterworth said, it is important for both the UK and Europe to keep up and challenge what is perhaps the present supremacy technologically of the United States and Japan. I am not so sure that we are all that far behind. We are in Europe, and I believe that we are taking this very seriously.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para60"></a>I am involved in a parliamentary group called European Informatics Market (EURIM) which runs alongside the parliamentary Information Technology Committee, with which I am also involved. We are trying to involve corporate organisations from this country and from Europe, and often the UK subsidiaries of American companies, to react very quickly and perhaps influence the directives that come from Brussels in matters of informatics and telematics, which is the use of IT. In fact, we spent this morning looking at the products of three of our working parties: procurement; data protection; and databases. Those three working parties have been working with tremendous input from lawyers and from members of the IT community here. Their activity is ably chaired by my noble friend Lord Chelmsford, to whom I am very grateful for his managing of the day-to-day activities of European Informatics Market. In this way we are keeping a sharp eye on the benefits that directives from the Commission can offer to our industry and to European industry as well, so as to ensure that the directives are very much in line with the needs not only of the providers of IT but most importantly of the users of their products. I am very grateful to my noble friend Lady Elles for the opportunity to discuss this most important matter.

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Birdwood: </B>   My Lords, where does one begin? My noble friend Lady Elles has framed a subject that would not be exhausted if we talked about it for two-and-a-half weeks, let alone two-and-a-half hours.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para61"></a>My interest in the area is at several levels. I yield to no one in my enthusiasm for technology. The speed of change in the underlying science is nothing short of awesome. Every time it is suggested that there is a physical threshold to miniaturisation or processing power, the hardware designers roll triumphantly through it. Now, for instance, we can contemplate switching devices whereby a handful of atoms can determine whether the switch is, so to speak, on or off. A signal round the world costs less than a phone call down the street. Every day someone, somewhere, does something <P>


<a name="column_1811"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1811</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new for technology. There are new materials, new techniques, new software architectures, new ways of storing information and new ways of using it.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para62"></a>My enthusiasm is no less for other dimensions of the subject under scrutiny. A fortnight ago from these Benches we explored the profound consequences of changing patterns of power in our society. All our lives are affected by the ongoing redistribution of power from historic political sources to new focuses. Power is drifting upwards and outwards to organisms and individuals out of reach of conventional politics. As a society we must rehearse our understanding of these deep changes. It is the information revolution that is both the engine and the enabling mechanism for this redistribution of power. If we study how science and social change interact one on the other, we have a telescope into the future, an early warning system for predicting how a society will evolve.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para63"></a>The Motion is rightly phrased in an optimistic, even jaunty, tone of voice. The blueprint for a government attitude of mind is the recommendation for infrastructure which my noble friend mentioned and which was published last year by the European Council called Europe and the global information society. The language was unusually strong and clear for a Brussels paper, but it was written by people who have real things to do in the real world. Perhaps I may quote selectively from the opening mission statement,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"actions must be taken ... to strike down entrenched positions which put Europe at a competitive disadvantage ... it means developing a common regulatory approach to bring forth a competitive, Europe-wide, market for information services; it does NOT mean more public money, financial assistance, subsidies, dirigisme, or protectionism".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="50614-04_para64"></a>The same document goes on to list a thoroughly practical catalogue of actions available to any government with the guts and vision to implement, but all the time emphasising the point that the market will be both the spur and the discipline.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para65"></a>So where are the opportunities for Great Britain in particular? The paradox is that by definition the information society mentioned in today's Motion recognises no national boundaries. Nations are transparent. At the end of the day, every transaction is between one individual and another. The world has become Speakers' Corner.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para66"></a>Indeed, the huge challenge for governments everywhere will be how to balance the idea of belonging to a country with the perceived irrelevance of national borders. Happily for us, we probably have more going for us as the information society overtakes humanity than many other communities. First, we still seem to be gifted at raw invention; there is a layer in the British psyche which is very non-conforming, and that is fertile ground for technical creativity in information technology. In the future society of the management of information, creativity will assume greater significance than ever. Secondly, we are showing the way&#151;at least I hope that we are&#151;in how a nation manages its way into post-industrial stability. I am afraid that no government can take the credit for that process, although the reply from the Front Bench may persuade me that I am wrong.

<P>

<a name="50614-04_para67"></a>I should like to think that it is the bedrock common sense of the British people which is the model for a stable and resilient accommodation for tomorrow's technology. Frankly, when I am feeling optimistic about Britain, I feel that we have a greater degree of realism about the post-industrial world than do most other countries. But then I look at the statistics about educational attainment, say, and I am again thrown into despair.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para68"></a>I suppose that if I had to pick out any one issue to do with the subject, it must be education. I ask noble Lords to notice that the Motion quite correctly speaks of "the information society". It does not say "the knowledge society" or "the wisdom society". Yet beyond information lie both those virtues. Without education, information is arid, mechanical stuff. Sure, it is facts, entertainment, games, shopping choice and survival in time of war. But let nobody be in any doubt about the consequences of letting education drift as a whole society adopts the tools of total information access.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para69"></a>Let me be more precise. It is difficult to appreciate just how pervasive that technology will be. The universally adopted word&#151;we have heard it three times already this afternoon&#151;which distils the process going on in the technical sphere is "convergence". Computing, communications, the media and electronic devices are flowing together to re-enter our lives with functions at which we can just guess. There are not even names for the hybrid products which will transform so much of what we do. So who is the "we" about whom I am talking? It is those individuals who have been educated to be proficient and comfortable with the new devices.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para70"></a>The danger signals could not be clearer. If we do not educate appropriately, we, the United Kingdom, will be picking up the pieces of great chunks of our population who are resentful, disenfranchised, shut out of citizenship and condemned to forms of poverty and illiteracy which will put extraordinary strains on the social fabric. The have-nots of the information society will be deprived of much more than just money. We will have our own version of the Berlin Wall, but one which will only have substance for the people whom we ignored in the education process while we still had the time to address it.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para71"></a>In that context, it is critical that the Government today embrace the recommendations which will be put forward to the G7 summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, later this week. Carlo de Benedetti commented in Monday's Financial Times that the education field lags seriously behind other areas in the use of new technology. Time and again, he stressed that this mission is a duty of this and any government. It is perverse not to use in the education process the very technology by which the country can thrive; and when by doing so education costs can probably be reduced.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para72"></a>If we grasp those issues, we cannot lose. But there is no shortage of doomsday projections on which to reflect. Jeremy Rifkin has written a book entitled The End of Work, which should be at the elbow of every social planner in Whitehall. When I am feeling deeply pessimistic about the future, however enthusiastic I am about the technology, I revisit some of Mr. Rifkin's thoughts. He raises the same problem that has troubled me for many years: that the wholesale substitution of machines for workers will force every nation to rethink <P>

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, I join with other noble Lords in expressing gratitude to my noble friend for moving the Motion today. IT is a vast, almost infinite, subject. It is no exaggeration to say that, as it evolves further, it will&#151;not may&#151;be all pervasive. It will change every aspect of all our lives out of all recognition.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para73"></a>With such a character, the opportunities inherent in IT&#151;social, economic, industrial, scientific, environmental, cultural and educational&#151;are equally infinite. More than that, IT is developing very quickly indeed. Its use and applications are expanding exponentially. The summary report of POST defines the information revolution as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a transformation from the industrial to the information age, causing as substantial a change in society as the move from an agricultural to an industrial society".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para74"></a>That is a useful comparison but it could be said to understate the position in two important respects. First, we are not in the dawn of that age. Rather, we are basking under the heat of its mid-morning sun, perhaps even to an extent whereby we are in danger of being burned. Secondly, the changes in society will not be "substantial" but absolute. On no account should we delude ourselves about that.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para75"></a>My noble friend's Motion is concerned with the information society. It is upon the specific notion of information itself that I wish to focus particularly today. Information is power and ultimately control. It has always been so. However, as a direct result of IT, its very nature is undergoing and has undergone a seminal and irreversible transformation. In her excellent speech to the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, on party political funding last week, my noble friend Lady Young articulated a concern that we all have about information in the IT age. She said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One of the most dangerous aspects of politics nowadays is that ... allegations are made, unsubstantiated by any evidence whatever and they are then assumed to be true".&#151;[Official Report, 7/6/95; col. 1363.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para76"></a>In the same context, my noble friend Lord Birdwood today iterated his concerns about IT, concerns which he expressed a month ago, during his debate on single issue groups, in this way:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"power imperceptibly is also trickling down and away from conventional politics into thousands of tiny streams of local and individual influence".&#151;[Official Report, 17/5/95; col. 595.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para77"></a>That is a process which he identified as having occurred because:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the media and single-issue groups have, so to speak, found each other. Their eyes have met across a crowded room".&#151;[col. 596.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para78"></a>Therefore, the question that we should be addressing is why that is so. As we face the expansion of the new information age, we should all recognise that these anxieties are but the tip of an iceberg of a very much wider sense of disaffection, as yet imperfectly articulated or <P>


<a name="column_1814"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1814</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expressed, felt throughout society, towards not just our democracy but governmental systems all around the world. As Dr. Johnson practically and topically stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para79"></a>What computer technology has done, as never before, is to indicate to the individual where information can be found, thereby giving him or her access to its power and to the control that it exerts. The Internet is an obvious example. In so doing it has empowered society&#151;all societies and not just our own&#151;to impose safeguards of accountability upon governments. Against a background of electorates showing signs of becoming more and more disillusioned by their respective political and parliamentary processes, we should not be surprised that IT holds so many magnetic and irresistible attractions.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para80"></a>I say that it has empowered society. At one level that is accurate enough. But at another it is much more diffuse than that. There is a very real sense in which operation of a computer is exclusive, personal, individualistic. Thus, IT tends to empower the individual in society rather more than society itself&#151;a phenomenon that my noble friend Lord Birdwood described as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a dangerous combination of personal powerlessness and personal empowerment".&#151;[Official Report, 17/5/95; col. 596.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para81"></a>There is one more brick to place in the edifice of this transformation. It can best be expressed thus:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"What computer information does, it transforms information into a wildly different status and gives it some sort of concreteness as if it's some sort of fact when it isn't".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para82"></a>That observation from Andrew Puddephatt, general secretary of Liberty, will, I am sure, strike a chord with many of your Lordships, not least my noble friend Lady Young.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para83"></a>There we have it. This is the "new" information. It now rules. It is everywhere. It infects every issue, and it represents one of the principal dilemmas facing us today. My noble friend's Motion today addresses,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the opportunities ... in the development of the information society".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para84"></a>With that to the forefront of my mind, I draw the attention of your Lordships to this comment from Nick Negroponte, founding member of MediaLab at MIT and acknowledged to be one of the foremost gurus of the IT age. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It's an unstoppable phenomenon&#151;you can slow it down, you can speed it up. But most of the people, and particularly legislators, are fundamentally clueless about what is going on".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para85"></a>This is a very real current in the tide of IT.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para86"></a>As I have already implied, more and more people are using the technology&#151;combined with their access to the "new" information&#151;as their opportunity to express their disaffection with what they perceive to be the inadequacies of parliamentary democracy. As observed by my noble friend Lady Young,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Democracy is being downgraded the whole time",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para87"></a>and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Every British institution is now subject to denigration of one kind or another".&#151;[Official Report, 7/6/95; col. 1360.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para88"></a>IT is redefining the nature and style of democracy. It will continue to do so, however subversive, pernicious or insidious we as parliamentarians may feel that process to be. By the same token, as other noble Lords <P>


<a name="column_1815"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1815</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have observed, IT has an immense power to corrupt. We had a stark and sobering indication of that over the weekend and we have to recognise that other time bombs of this sort are just waiting to explode. Detective Inspector Ron Laverick, commenting upon a case reported in the press over the weekend, opined:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You only have to imagine the potential for paedophiles, terrorists and pornography".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para89"></a>One thing is certain in all this. We cannot be passive in the face of this change. Should we persist in playing "catch-up" with the new technology, in being driven by it, it will continue to outpace us and will ultimately consume us. It is only by being literate with IT rather than ignorant of it, by working with it rather than behind it, by leading it rather than letting it lead us, that we can ensure that its immense power for good can be realised and enacted.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para90"></a>Some noble Lords, notably the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, expressed a desire for regulation of IT and particularly the Internet. That exemplifies the sort of dilemmas with which we are grappling. The Internet is global. It is individualistic. It is boundless. It is either intensely democratic or anarchic&#151;sometimes it is hard to tell which. With all due respect to the noble Baroness, how can any national government impose their regulatory will upon the net? I do not say that we should not try; I just question how feasible such a desire is.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para91"></a>This therefore is the challenge before us. This is our opportunity. It is imperative that we as a legislative body absorb and adapt to the fundamental changes that have already been wrought by the information revolution and which, I hasten to add, will continue to occur with ever-increasing rapidity.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para92"></a>In conclusion, who can really say where the voyage of exploration and discovery that is the information revolution will eventually take us? No matter the eventual destination. What is of consequence is that we have a compelling responsibility, a duty even, to grasp the philosophical complexities of its embryonic mind-set in order that we can shape them to the benefit of society. Should we ignore this we shall disappoint both ourselves and the public. IT needs a legislature and political system that is healthy, robust and well-versed in its intricacies if its capacity to work for the greater good is to be achieved and sustained. As I say, this is our opportunity: we must grasp it now.

<P>
<A NAME="50614-04_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   My Lords, I am the 10th speaker today and confess astonishment as to how much there is still left to say on this subject, and I congratulate my noble friend Lady Elles on the skill of her choice. I certainly cannot pick up on all the matters I should like to in the time available, so I shall concentrate on just two aspects.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para93"></a>I felt that I should look at how we actually use the revolution about which everyone has been talking to add value to the United Kingdom. I have some thoughts on that which I should like to share with your Lordships. Politically by plenty of freedom: that is, freedom to <P>


<a name="column_1816"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1816</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>compete; by level playing fields; by lots of liberalisation and as little regulation as we can get away with (I am a great believer in the 80/20 rule between freedom and regulation; I do not think there is any right or wrong in that); and by a strong anti-monopoly law.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para94"></a>All that is easy to say, but it is harder to achieve. What is a "monopoly" anyway? If we really are in a global marketplace, and everyone pays lip service to this, then is it a monopoly where one company in the UK has 10 per cent. of the global market and in achieving that gains 90 per cent. of the domestic market? And is the answer to that possibly different depending on whether that company's product is a &#163;3,000 PC or a &#163;100 million jumbo jet? I do not pretend to know the answer. Some quite difficult questions are involved. I will offer my instinct, which is that global trade should take precedence over domestic considerations. Indeed, I support the recent Foresight Technology report on ITEC (information technology, electronics and communications), with its comments that multinationals must be supported because they are the groups which will lead in our global competition.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para95"></a>What else can government do? For a start, I should like to see a more positive endorsement of the whole area of IT by individual Cabinet Ministers. They could give us a stronger personal lead. The Government need to be vigilant&#151;indeed, they are being vigilant&#151;concerning the danger that the UK suffers from the speed of the slowest EU state. A lot of people do not believe in liberalisation, not just of telecoms but of utilities, post offices and so forth.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para96"></a>We clearly need to see a much stronger use of IT across government departments. In that regard we recently had the White Paper on public procurement which gives a strong lead on that, so I am optimistic that it will help us move in that direction. We need to free-up public information. I am afraid that the Americans have stolen a march on us and already have all their parliamentary proceedings free on the Internet&#151;Internet again&#151;whereas we have only just begun.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para97"></a>I am pleased to be able to tell your Lordships that the latest DTI paper, Forging Ahead, can be read free on the Internet. But if one wants a hard copy, one must still go to Her Majesty's Stationery Office and pay &#163;19. So there are still problems to be sorted out.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para98"></a>What applications will give us an advantage? I just have time in the space allotted to me to talk about a few with which I am personally involved; it certainly will be nothing like the broad canvas of all the issues we could talk about. I should like to start by reinforcing my strong belief for what I call "market networks". This is where the whole of a market comes together on a common system and a set of common standards actually to drive its business electronically. It opens up a whole new round of productivity for that market and improved client service. New services are shared, which is where productivity comes in. Costs are reduced, competition becomes more focused and companies re-engineer and benchmark. Very importantly, I believe, small and medium-sized enterprises gain low-cost entry into electronic marketplaces, and in doing so they learn the benefits of standardisation and discipline in the process.
<P>


<a name="column_1817"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1817</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para99"></a>Next&#151;and this has already been mentioned&#151;I should like to see more focus on teleworking. I believe that last week there was a debate, which, unfortunately, I could not attend, on pollution. The only noble Lord who mentioned the fact that teleworkers mean less travel and less travel means less pollution was my noble friend Lord Mersey. It has also been said that those who telework most are those who live furthest from their workplace, so that the reduction in pollution is more than pro rata.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para100"></a>But there are other points arising from teleworking. It helps the office to move from the old basis of the owned desk of the employee to a series of workstations which anyone can come to on the day they happen to be at the office. They can plug in to any workstation and be connected to their electronic filing cabinet. That is a totally different concept and it is one which reduces space for the employer.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para101"></a>Video conferencing is now becoming so easy, with PC video conferencing at a reasonable rate, that one can video conference from home into the office or go to the office and video conference across the seas to overseas colleagues or clients overseas or whatever. So I believe that teleworking is something on which we should put a great deal of emphasis in support.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para102"></a>It is essential that we continue to carry on with the lead which we have at the moment in many cases as regards the work that goes on in the making of international standards. This country in particular depends on trade to have an appropriate balance of payments. Standards are an essential part these days of being able to communicate with the rest of the world. It is not generally known, though EDI was mentioned in this House recently, that it is my own group, SITPRO, of which I am an unpaid board member&#151;and I declare that interest&#151;which took the lead in driving through the EDI standards for the United Kingdom. Our chief executive was a founder member of what is now known as the EDIFACT standard and is currently the international rapporteur in charge of all the area rapporteurs. In fact, he was the man responsible for setting up the Far East EDIFACT board and also the African EDIFACT board.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para103"></a>SITPRO at the moment is going through a process of repositioning. It is the DTI's policy that it will move standards from the public sector to the private sector. I do not necessarily disagree with that. I do not believe that it is appropriate for the Government always to continue to subsidise the various activities in which they are engaged. However, it is very important at this moment that we do not actually damage United Kingdom interests. We have here officials who are out in the international world and who are highly respected. The position needs to be thought about very carefully lest in withdrawing them we actually damage our interests in the rest of the world. It is perhaps ironic that they become far better known overseas internationally than at home.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para104"></a>Another area I wish to look at and share briefly with noble Lords is road transport informatics. I have just been made president of a group called RTI Focus which deals in the area of intelligent transport systems. Probably all noble Lords have seen the RouteMaster product which is already in the shops. I was shown one in Walsall the other day. It demonstrated quite clearly to me that there was a foul-up on the M.6-side of the motorway box so I happily <P>


<a name="column_1818"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1818</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>travelled home via the M.5 side. Incidentally, it also told me&#151;and this is a tiny little three-inch screen&#151;that there were problems at the M.25-M.23 intersection which someone more knowledgeable than I am said was undoubtedly roadworks. That is irrelevant and it did not actually matter to me. But is it not amazing that you can have a three-inch screen sitting on the dashboard which will tell you which motorways to avoid? And that is just the beginning of what is coming to us.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para105"></a>There are also inductive loops in the carriageways which are being used increasingly to put information onto the dashboard about the speeds at which one should travel because of the dangers ahead and to collect tolls in the event that there is to be a charge for using the road. Incidentally, if one does not pay the toll because one's smartcard is out of action or not charged, there are cameras to identify the number plate and catch you later.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para106"></a>Perhaps most extraordinary of all, there are plans for road trains. That really is advanced technology. I understand that a combination of wires in the road, radar in the car and various other devices will allow us to hold our cars central to the carriageway, much closer to the car in front and at a steady speed, thus substantially increasing the number of cars on the road. That may be good in that we do not have to build more roads but it may be bad for pollution. Nevertheless, these are some of the things that are being developed in this area where the United Kingdom has the opportunity to lead.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para107"></a>Those are some of the matters in which I am involved. I would love to talk about more of them but time is running out. Perhaps finally I may point out one area which has not been touched on today and that is the interplay between employers and employees as this revolution continues. I remind noble Lords of the words of Charles Handy, the well-known expert on personnel. He has suggested that as employers are forced to downsize by the need to reduce costs, so the employee will have to move to a position where his loyalty is to himself first, his trade second and his employer third. That is a very radical revolution.

<A NAME="50614-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, before coming to this debate I had wondered whether it was an exaggeration to say, as some would, that the information revolution is of an order of importance comparable with the Industrial Revolution. Having listened to today's debate&#151;and what a pity not more noble Lords are present to hear it&#151;no one who has heard the quite remarkable speeches can doubt that this is in fact a revolution at least of the same order of importance as the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, it requires the same kind of understanding, action and foresight which, alas, was not available at that time, and because it was not available, it landed us with troubles and difficulties which could have been avoided. I am not blaming those at the time because they did not have the opportunities for foresight that we have today. It is far less excusable if we do not seize those opportunities because of the foresight which is given to us.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para108"></a>So much of importance has been said today. Primarily, I wish to focus on two areas. One has been mentioned a great deal and I would like to say a little more about it. <P>


<a name="column_1819"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1819</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Except for the last speaker, the noble Viscount, Lord Chelmsford, there has been remarkably little attention paid to it. The first is the issue of education. If we apply information technology adventurously and, if necessary, extravagantly, it can give us a return which we urgently need. It is the best opportunity&#151;and it may be the only one&#151;that we have to redress the failures in education which mark and handicap us at present.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para109"></a>It can be done in a great many ways if the equipment and the will are there to back it. One method is to move it into the schools and colleges for the generation which is coming along. Everyone says that that generation is better at these things than the rest of us. But unfortunately for this country, there are a great many of the rest of us still around who do not really know anything like enough about this subject. Among the rest of us is that huge backlog of people to whom I have referred boringly often, I know, in your Lordships' House, who left our schools inadequately educated, who were totally inadequately trained either by the state system or by employers afterwards, and who are now a huge backlog of under-educated, under-trained people in an economy in which there will be opportunities only for those who have knowledge and skills and who can learn and have the confidence to do so.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para110"></a>Surely, this is where information technology, as applied to education can, if we have the will to do it, redress that balance more swiftly than in any other way. Indeed, I can think of no other way in which it can be done. It applies to so many people. It applies to those whose skills have become out of date. The question of up-dating all the time is one of the major problems, both industrially and educationally, today.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para111"></a>We used to think in my day&#151;I must admit that in many ways I am glad that that day is passing&#151;that if you were reasonably qualified at the age of 22 or 23, you were all right for life. We now know that that is most certainly not the case. People have to update their skills. They have to have a good education to start with, but they must then have the opportunity to update what they already know. If what they already know has become obsolescent, they have to be able to learn entirely new things.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para112"></a>Information technology can help us, but only if there is adequate investment in people and if people understand how it can be used. It has particular advantages for women who can benefit from information technology if they have appropriate education opportunities. I refer particularly to those women who want to return to a labour market which they left in order to take up their family responsibilities, but for which they may not have been adequately trained.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para113"></a>I turn now to an issue that was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Birdwood, in his remarkably thoughtful address. I must say that I thought that the noble Lord was unnecessarily pessimistic about employment opportunities in the future. We must prepare properly for them. I remind the noble Lord and the House that there is a vast range of unsatisfied needs in the world. There are not only unsatisfied wants&#151;we know that there are plenty of those&#151;there are also basic unsatisfied needs. In those circumstances, it cannot be true that there is not work to be done. The problem is that we do not have people who <P>


<a name="column_1820"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are trained and equipped to do it. Furthermore, we do not have an economic system which turns those wants into effective demands. However, that is another issue. It is not something to be dealt with today in the remaining five minutes that are allowed to me. That point surely gives the lie to the argument that because information technology is, thank goodness, doing away with many of the dullest jobs which many of us did not want to do, there will be no work for the rest. There will be work&#151;but only if we prepare for it, and only if we have trained people and the right equipment. Indeed, we shall need the courage to be able to face and overcome the challenges with which such changes confront us. This is not a task that we can give up. It is within our grasp if only we can recognise and seize it&#151;and if only the Government would give the lead.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para114"></a>Another issue which has not been referred to&#151;unless it was raised while I was out of the Chamber having tea&#151;is teleworking. I am surprised that more has not been said about it. Teleworking means people working in various different ways from their own homes rather than in offices or factories. Teleworking can present us with great opportunities and advantages, but possibly with great disadvantages also. It is important that we accept that a great deal of work will follow that pattern. However, we shall need to monitor it carefully, and to research and consult on its development. We shall need to do so because teleworking does not operate on any great scale at the moment. I understand that only about 7 per cent. of employers use the system and that only 2 per cent. of employees work in that way. Therefore, at the moment the scale is such that we can understand and cope with it. That means that we can have our plans ready before we are overcome by it.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para115"></a>Some reference has been made to the fact that teleworking and information technology generally could help to relieve transport congestion and pollution. It will also present people with an opportunity to spend more time in their own homes. There is, however, a question-mark over that aspect. At a women's conference in Alberta over 10 years ago, I remember nearly being torn limb from limb when I mentioned the advantages of working from home. Those women said, "Half the point of going out to work is that you get away from home. We do not in the least want to be tied up at home". Indeed, I can see what those women meant about working at home, with a man about the house all the time, equipment littered all over the place and the children answering the telephone when somebody else should be doing that. That way of working is only for some people.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para116"></a>We must consider variations on teleworking, such as the use of telecottages. Increased teleworking will come, and although it has its disadvantages, it has one great advantage. I attended a conference on this matter in Berlin last November at which trade unionists from Scotland said that teleworking could bring work back into the Highlands and Islands and might mean that people need not travel to Glasgow, for example. However, that can happen only if we get the equipment right and if we handle it properly. I beg the Government to take this matter seriously and to put money into finding out what is good and what is not good, and what people want and what they do not want.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para117"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, was absolutely right, as he nearly always is, that it would be ridiculous to do such work on our own. Surely this is something which is pan-European. It would be absurd to try to develop information technology here in isolation from what is going on in other countries. The whole thing is international by its very nature. We would be reinventing the wheel one after another if we did not work together. We would be wasting a great deal of money and getting into a state of great confusion. Surely we do not want to repeat the muddles that we made with the railways&#151;because we developed them in isolation, we find that they do not match those on the Continent. We are now building new information tracks. Let us all work together so that they mesh and run as economically, effectively and as internationally as possible. Indeed, where necessary, they should be as supranational as possible. If we can do that, we have a bright future ahead, but we need to be able to use the information technology which is here for us to harness.

<P>
<A NAME="50614-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, this has been a fascinating debate and we are all indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, for introducing it. I am very pleased that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is to reply to the debate because that emphasises the importance of industry, which I still think is the most important aspect.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para118"></a>There have been massive technological advances over our lifetimes, but they are as nothing compared with what will happen in the next generation. Nonetheless, when we reflect on desk-top and lap-top computers, and, more importantly, on their associated software, faxes, photocopiers, the Internet in all its many dimensions, e-mail, or even the humble telephone in its mobile form, and many other forms of communication, data storage, analysis, and reproduction, all of which are available to the ordinary household, we realise that the present position is astonishing and would have been regarded as part of a dream world, even science fiction when we were young. With regard to all that, we are bound to say, "The truth is out there".
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para119"></a>However, there can be no doubt about the economic significance of all this. The leaders in these fields will dominate the economic world of the future, and derive from that political power. I shall return to our country's position in all that in a moment.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para120"></a>Having said that, we must not exaggerate. I spend&#151;perhaps I should say "I waste"&#151;a lot of time on the Internet. Perhaps I may advise my noble friend Lady Dean and other noble Lords that although I browse around and surf on the Internet, I have not yet found a single pornographic image&#151;no sex, no violence. I am not sure whether I am lucky or unlucky, but where is it? If any noble Lord would care to join me in trying to find it on the Internet, I should be obliged. But after the initial enthusiasm, what strikes me about the Internet is how little is there, rather than how much. There will, of course, be a lot more in future.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para121"></a>Like the noble Viscount, Lord Chelmsford, I hope in particular that Her Majesty's Government will get a move on and make sure that many more government documents <P>


<a name="column_1822"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1822</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are available there. As an aside, I discovered that last year's Red Book was made accessible by the Treasury on-line. I was surprised to see how primitive it is&#151;the words are available, but not the graphs. I was intrigued to hear from the noble Viscount that the DTI's latest document is there because it has not only graphs, but pictures. I shall try to get the relevant HTTP address to see what it actually contains. As a minimum, departmental press statements and related material should be freely available on the Internet with no delay. I should also mention the position of databases. It is true of English law that even the most mundane of databases can be copyright. As I understand it, there is a European Union directive in the offing which may change all that. Since databases lie at the heart of the information society, it is surely right that we should question how freely available they should be. I think that they should be freely available.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para122"></a>Again, I should like to strike possibly a slightly different note and ask your Lordships not to exaggerate the value of the new technology compared with the old. By the old, I mean books and pencil and paper. Quick communication is valuable on occasion, but in my experience is not always necessary, let alone desirable.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para123"></a>I have written this speech on a word processor, but I correct it as I go along using a pen. When it comes to massive data analysis, a computer and its software are indispensable, but, for example, preparing for a Question in your Lordships' House tomorrow, it is easier to look up the relevant one or two facts in Economic Trends rather than the version that I have on disc. I know&#151;and this has been referred to&#151;that there are many books on CD.Rom, and that is useful for reference and research, but I can hardly believe that anyone, certainly none of your Lordships, would want to curl up in bed with one's computer and associated paraphernalia. The ultimate paradox is that word processing has not led to a reduction in the use of paper, since most people find it easier to start correcting from the hard copy, and, if anything, make many more mistakes when they are working on screen. That is true of me.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para124"></a>Earlier I used the word "freely" when I was talking about databases. The point is that information has an economic value. I think I am right that it cannot be patented or made copyright per se. But it can be protected as intellectual property in the form in which it is presented. To use my earlier example, or that of the noble Viscount, Lord Chelmsford, the Red Book is copyright, but the information contained therein is not. All governments will have to decide how much of the intellectual property they own should be placed in the public domain. The more general and fundamental question is whether existing law of copyright and patents is satisfactory for the information society. My judgment is that it is not. In particular, we need to address most carefully what is to be protected as intellectual property, and what is not. I am concerned, for example, with attempts by American firms, in particular, to patent in bio-technology and space what are essentially ideas and discoveries. Attempts have been made in the past to go over what I regard as the correct line with respect to some aspects of computer software and mathematical algorithms.
<P>


<a name="column_1823"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1823</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para125"></a>Having said that, it is apparent that the scale of world-wide piracy of intellectual property in the information and associated fields is large and growing. Again, it would be disastrous if the free flow of ideas and information were impeded, but that is not the same as allowing free use and copying of intellectual property.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para126"></a>I have referred to the UK economic interest. Obviously, we are a significant market. But are we doing enough in the areas of computer software and hardware? How much of all forms of equipment used for communications in this country is produced here? I am not an expert, but a cursory examination even in your Lordships' House does not reveal many "Made in Britain" labels on the equipment or the software. The Americans are dominant but, not surprisingly, a good deal of the material is manufactured in the Pacific Rim. I can see no intrinsic reason why we should not have a stronger position than we do, especially bearing in mind the sort of lead we used to have in those areas. Some of the most fundamental work on all these things was done by citizens of this country.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para127"></a>Our university departments of mathematics, science and engineering have always produced great figures in areas related to the information society. There is no reason why they should not continue to do so, as long as the facilities are available and there is a good working environment. I regret to say, wearing my university hat, that there is a shortage of resources in the universities and that has placed a great deal of all this activity in peril. Science and engineering in this country are underfunded, and, more important, it remains true that scientists and engineers are insufficiently appreciated and, looking around your Lordships' House, are poorly paid compared with accountants, and lawyers, let alone foreign exchange speculators. Those last categories will never make us rich; scientists and engineers will.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para128"></a>All that leads me on to education. With regard to that, I have to say our time has gone. It is the young who matter. They take the advances that I and other noble Lords have referred to for granted. When I tell junior colleagues that the sort of calculation that took two of us a couple of days to finish in my research days at Princeton now takes a few seconds, they are bored with such reminiscences. I think that is for the good. But we must make sure, as noble Lords have said, that the education curriculum reflects that. Incidentally, let me just say on education that I am astounded that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, most of whose speech I entirely agreed with, even remotely thinks of looking at any computer manuals. They are just imperfectly translated from the original Japanese. The only thing to do is to bang keys on the keyboard or, better still, click one's mouse and it will all come out happily in the end. Young people know that. We must have equal confidence.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para129"></a>None of it is intellectually that demanding. Word processing, and the use of spreadsheets could and should be taught in primary schools. It is certainly easier than programming a video recorder. I take a similar view of access to the Internet. An eight year-old who can play a computer game will have no difficulty in surfing the worldwide web.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para130"></a>Of course, I am still old fashioned enough to push the virtues of numeracy and literacy. I want our young people to understand what underlies what they do, but I do not regard that as incompatible with or inimical to modern methods. The noble Lord, Lord Renwick, made that point. To quote an example I have used before, when I was at school we did something called "tots"; that is, we added up vast columns of numbers. The ability to do so was regarded as a test of intelligence, although I have never understood why.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para131"></a>I am convinced that one should be able to add, and to understand what one is doing. But I hope nobody in their right mind will ever add large columns of figures again when a spreadsheet will do it for you, and guarantee to get it right.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para132"></a>We have argued before about the end of the days of the unskilled labourer. That is surely so. But let me say, echoing what the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, those who have expressed a pessimistic view are wrong. For 200 years the argument has been presented that labour-saving technological advance will make most people irrelevant and unemployed. But that has not happened. More people are employed in our country, and indeed, in the world than ever before. If I had time, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, said, I could explain why, echoing David Ricardo of nearly 200 years ago, that has not happened and why it will not happen. That I am afraid will have to be for another debate.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para133"></a>I must hurry to my conclusion. We must emphasise that the information society requires a new form of literacy which we neglect at our peril. As I say, I do not accept the so-called supply side explanations for the rise of unemployment, but that does not mean that there is no such thing as technological unemployment. As the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and others have said, the labour force must acquire these new skills; otherwise the economy will run too rapidly into capacity constraints when we expand demand.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para134"></a>Finally, there are serious social problems here. The information society must be accessible to all for economic reasons, but it must also be available to all, as noble Lords have said, for political and social reasons. I conclude by emphasising that no one should be left out of the new world which we are creating.

<A NAME="50614-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Earl Ferrers): </B>  My Lords, I should like to join with other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lady Elles for giving us the opportunity to address this important subject. It has been an enormously interesting debate. It has been particularly notable that no fewer than five noble Baronesses have taken part. So the experience of my noble friend Lady Park of being only the second woman to address the Oxford Union&#151;apparently in some people's eyes that was a derogatory act&#151;evidently did not stop her or deter her from taking part in this debate. Nor were many other deterred. I was glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, who is such a distinguished chairman of ICSSTIS, was good enough to say that she was a chairman and not a chair or a chair person or some other emasculation of a perfectly good word.
<P>


<a name="column_1825"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1825</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para135"></a>I find the whole subject enormously exciting. It is, in many respects, to the humble layman almost incomprehensible; but it provides enormous opportunities which should be understood, in so far as trying to understand the incomprehensible is a possibility, and taken up by everyone. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, referred to it as a revolution, and she was right. The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, wondered whether the revolution is as important as the Industrial Revolution. I believe that it is. Its effect on our future lives will be astonishing and it equates easily, if not exceeds, the changes which the Industrial Revolution brought about.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para136"></a>I have always wondered exactly what we mean when we talk about the information society. Essentially, I believe that it is a society in which information is accessible on a quite unprecedented scale not just to businesses, manufacturers and boffins but in, and to, every strata of life. The information will create new patterns of demand and supply and will alter our whole way of life in ways in which&#151;I think in 10 years' time&#151;we would have thought inconceivable.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para137"></a>Many of us are not used to thinking of information as a commodity. One tends to think that a commodity is a bar of soap or a light bulb. But information is a commodity. It is something which we need in order to take decisions and we must be prepared to pay for it. News, educational material, advertising and financial analysis are all valuable products. We are all quite happy to walk into a shop to buy a book or a newspaper; but increasingly we will become used to acquiring information electronically.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para138"></a>Already&#151;and this is a staggering thought&#151;the value of information which is entering the United Kingdom each year exceeds the value of goods which are being unloaded at United Kingdom ports. This explosion of trade in information has come about through new technologies; the new technologies which have created the superhighways for information. Optical fibre technology can, for instance, transmit information across the world almost instantaneously and in huge amounts. At any one time, all the telephone calls which are now made in Britain can be carried down one fibre-optic cable the thickness of a cat's hair.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para139"></a>As my noble friend Lord Birdwood said, the change is awesome. Computer technology has advanced, and continues to advance, at unbelievable speed. I remember what seems only a few years ago, but it is probably 30, seeing the first computer which British European Airways had. The company built a special building to house it in the Cromwell Road on the site which is now a Sainsbury's supermarket. It was so excited about it that it took some Members of this House and another place to see it. It is almost beyond belief to think that the power of that mainframe computer which in the 1970s required that large building, can now be fitted into something the size of a mobile telephone. The amount of computing power, which is available at a given price, doubles every 14 months. This is geometric progression at an unbelievable rate, to which at present there seems no finality.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para140"></a>My noble friend Lord Birdwood referred to the fact that the techniques are converging. Indeed, they are. Digital information will be the common currency in the future of telecommunications, broadcasting and computing. My noble friend Lord Butterworth raised the specific question <P>


<a name="column_1826"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1826</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of whether, in the light of the convergence, the Government plan to review the responsibilities of Oftel and the Independent Television Commission. The Government have no present plans to review the responsibilities of either those two bodies. However, I note that convergence may have future implications for our system of regulation. And the distinctions between these technologies and the industries which use them will become increasingly irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para141"></a>The storage of text and pictures on compact discs which can be read on a computer screen, for example, makes publishing just another electronic industry. The Encyclopaedia Britannica&#151;all 44 million words of it&#151;is now available on a single compact disc and it can be searched by a computer in seconds. On the same disc, just as a buckshee extra, you can find Roget's Thesaurus and Webster's English Dictionary&#151;and the whole can be sent down an optical fibre in little more than a second. Electronic newspapers are gaining ground quickly, as people recognise the advantage of being able to get the news which they want as soon as possible: foreign affairs and no sport, or no foreign affairs and sport.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para142"></a>I do not wish to dwell too much on the technology, amazing though it is. Our fathers would have thought it all quite impossible. But then they would have thought it impossible for a man to go to the moon. And who would have thought that human beings could be packed&#151;and would be prepared to be packed&#151;into a container such as Concorde and propelled around the world at the speed of a bullet? But all that has happened. And technology enabled that to happen then. How much more will it enable other things to happen in the future? Technology, after all, is only a tool and the truly exciting thing about it is the opportunities which it offers us. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady O'Cathain for explaining how IT has helped Tesco to improve its service&#151;a matter about which she has some experience.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para143"></a>The information society is changing the life of the individual in almost every respect. The four television channels, which we had for so long, have become 40 or more today over cable and satellite, and they will keep multiplying, offering entertainment, news and analysis.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para144"></a>As my noble friend Lady Elles said, as many as one in four United Kingdom homes now has a computer. She compared that with Europe and said that we are doing better. So we are, and will continue; but Europe must increase its number. These will increasingly be used to obtain services such as banking and shopping. Barclays, Sainsbury's and W.H. Smith already offer services over the Internet and other computer networks.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para145"></a>Work too will increasingly be done from home over electronic networks. We will see more people developing what are known as "portfolio" careers; careers which will enable them to offer their services as freelancers part-time to a number of employers in order to make up a full-time job. As was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, people will do their shopping with their video computer or TV screen, finding out what are the types and costs, for instance, of three-piece suites provided by different retailers.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para146"></a>Children are increasingly learning about computers and more and more schools are being connected to the Internet. This is not just a change in the way in which <P>


<a name="column_1827"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1827</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learning is taught. Electronic networks, in fact, make possible an enormous increase in the amount of information which is actually available to teachers and pupils. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, spoke of obtaining information from museums. A visit to the British Museum is an event in the life of any school boy or girl. For a child living away from London, it may be a once in a lifetime visit. New technology could make the whole of the British Museum available to a child in a classroom. He will not only be able to look at King Alfred's jewel in a case and read the facts about it but he will be able to turn it around and examine it from every angle, accompanied by a commentary from the world's greatest experts. And it will not be limited only to British Museums and British artefacts; the same child will be able to visit the Prado and the Louvre without leaving his desk.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para147"></a>Education and training for adults will be transformed. Already medical students in one part of the country can, via a screen, follow operations which are being carried out in another part of the country by leading surgeons, seeing the operation, as it were, through the surgeon's eyes. A tiny TV camera attached to the spectacles of a surgeon enables a viewer to see exactly what it is that the surgeon sees. This is an astonishing innovation but one which I personally would be quite happy to be without.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para148"></a>Hard-pressed workers requiring up-to-the-minute training will be able to receive it without leaving their desks by calling up services over a computer network. Patients, too, will have access to greater expertise. A patient visiting her GP will be able to have her symptoms and initial diagnosis discussed with a specialist who will then be able to see and to discuss her symptoms both with the GP and herself and agree on treatment.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para149"></a>For business, the development of the information society represents a huge opportunity. Let us take the example of the Internet. Some 30 million people are thought to use this global computer network. Of course, many of these people only want to use the Internet for academic research, or for communicating with other Internet users on subjects in which they have a common interest. But many others will be interested in doing something new and different.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para150"></a>My noble friends Lord Renwick and Lord Butterworth, and other noble Lords, have said that there are great opportunities in that regard. For example, you can now order flowers over the Internet. The American firm which provides that service sells more flowers than does any other company in the world. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said that you can access Playboy on the Internet. I must say that I did not know that; but a number of people evidently take advantage of it. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, also did not know about that. It just shows that he is not the fount of all knowledge, even though he is the fount of a great deal of knowledge. I can tell the noble Lord how to access it, but I have no intention of doing so because it would be bad for the noble Lord. Another less risqu&#233; example comes from the world of car advertising. Toyota recently placed an advertisement on the Internet. It received 30,000 responses over a single weekend.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para151"></a>But the opportunity is by no means limited to the Internet. There is the world-wide market for multimedia personal computers&#151;computers which can cope with <P>


<a name="column_1828"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1828</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sounds and pictures as well as words. That market has more than doubled in size during last year. We must not underestimate the scale of the opportunity. The software and computer services industry, for example, has grown at an average rate of nearly 20 per cent. per annum over the past decade. The value of the combined IT and telecommunications industries in the UK is more than &#163;30,000 million per annum. That puts it in the same field as the annual cost of United Kingdom healthcare. But the opportunity is not one which can be measured only by numbers; nor is it only an opportunity for suppliers. There is an opportunity for all organisations to use information and communication technologies so that they can make radical changes to the whole way in which they go about their business.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para152"></a>My noble friend Lady O'Cathain referred to Tesco. Perhaps I may give her another example&#151;that is, John Brown Engineers and Constructors. That company has used state-of-the-art technology to create a global communications network&#151;a network which is capable of carrying vast amounts of data between John Brown offices wherever they are in the world. A highly complicated design&#151;itself created with the help of computers&#151;can be transferred from the UK to Australia in seconds. Each design centre now has immediate access to the entire information and experience of the whole organisation. And managers can shift design tasks around the world, in phase with time zones, thereby enabling 24-hour working.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para153"></a>One might ask what part the Government have to play in all that. As a start, as my noble friend Lord Chelmsford said, the Government too can benefit from using the new technologies. He said that there needs to be a stronger lead from Cabinet Ministers. I can tell my noble friend that, entirely coincidentally, my right honourable friend the President of the Board of Trade has made a very important speech on that subject only this morning to the Institute of Directors.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para154"></a>The Government can use IT to improve their internal communications. In the DTI, we are experiencing a quiet revolution as the whole department moves on to a single computer network, with electronic mail messages taking the place of minutes and memoranda on paper. I, for one, will be eternally grateful for that. But I am bound to say that I have not noticed it too much myself yet, but I expect that is because it is thought&#151;not without reason&#151;that I am too stupid to work the instrument.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para155"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on being on the Internet. He said that more government information should be available on the Internet. The DTI Internet server goes live, curiously enough, today. The noble Lord and any other noble Lord can access that. I shall tell the noble Lord, Lord Peston, how to do that because it would be quite suitable for him to receive that information. He can access it by dialling, "http://www.dti.gov.uk". I hope it works. If it does not, I shall have to make sure that I have given the noble Lord the right information.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para156"></a>More importantly, we can use IT to improve our external communications: for consulting people on what they want from Government, for making available information about what the Government are up to; and for providing services to the public. Already, the Department of Education has made its public inquiry point accessible <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>on the Internet. The Department of Social Security has developed a special terminal which provides members of the public with touch-screen access to information about benefits. The Department of Trade and Industry is establishing a video-conferencing network which is connecting its headquarters in London with its offices in the regions, the new business links, and some of our embassies abroad.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para157"></a>But clearly the Government's role is not just to take advantage of the new technology itself. We have to ensure that our children are taught how to use this remarkable technology at an early age. Many noble Lords referred to that, and I am glad that my noble friend Lord Renwick thinks that it is being done well in some schools.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para158"></a>My noble friend Lord Birdwood referred to Signor Carlo de Benedetti, who is the chairman of Olivetti. As my noble friend said, he wrote an article for the Financial Times on Monday of this week which said that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Digitalisation and the growing use of computers are creating new forms of illiteracy and poverty&#151;even in the most advanced societies".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para159"></a>He went on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"computer illiteracy affects every social group. It is not confined to the poorest social classes".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para160"></a>I shuddered when I read that; but it is true.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para161"></a>Many noble Lords have said that education is important. So it is. That is why the Government have made Information Technology a core part of the national curriculum. Indeed, the United Kingdom is now one of the leading countries in the world which is ensuring that its children are educated in the knowledge, and in the use, of Information Technology.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para162"></a>The Government also have a vital role to play in setting the rules of the game for the private sector so that private companies can invest and can develop the goods and services which consumers want. Of course, man can mar as well as make. Quite rightly, a number of anxieties have been expressed about pornography. Computer networks can be used for that purpose. The Government took action last year to try and address that by bringing the storage and distribution of computer-led child pornography within the scope of the Protection of Children Act. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, that self-regulation may have a part to play. We must resist the temptation to impose regulations on a new and developing part of our lives until we can see in what form it settles down. As my noble friend Lady Elles said, technology can itself help to limit access.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para163"></a>When it comes to Europe and to the wider international scene, the United Kingdom has a leading role to play. What has given us the edge in Europe is the strength and the diversity which derives from competition&#151;competition which has been possible only because of our liberalised telecommunications industry.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para164"></a>One very influential Italian businessman said to me the other day, "Of course, you in the United Kingdom are 10 years ahead of other European countries in freeing up your markets; in using IT," and, believe it or not, in "lack of government interference". The figures speak for themselves. We have moved from a monopoly in 1984 to a position where there are now almost 150 public telecommunications operators. Our broadband university <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>network, SuperJANET, is unique in Europe. We are Europe's leading manufacturer of computers and colour televisions.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para165"></a>I agree with my noble friends Lord Cockfield and Lord Butterworth and the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, that the information society world is, by its very nature, no respecter of borders. Satellite and cable networks enable vast amounts of data to flow rapidly between countries. You cannot stop that; the technology is there; and others are doing it. We have to make sure that we are not left behind.
<P>

<a name="50614-04_para166"></a>We are in the middle of huge changes which reflect every aspect of our way of life in ways in which most of us cannot begin to envisage. But in the Industrial Revolution of the last century, Britain was the workshop of the world. As my noble friend Lady Park said, we must learn to ride this tiger. In the information revolution which is now taking place, there is no reason why Britain should not lead the world.

<A NAME="50614-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for his reply, which has been extremely helpful and has encouraged every speaker who took part in the debate to recognise the role of government in the development of information technology and in keeping, as he said, the United Kingdom way ahead in this field. I thank all noble Lords who took part in the debate. When I initiated it, I realised that I had a lot to learn. Having heard the debate this evening, I realise that I have even more to learn. I congratulate and thank most warmly all those who have brought instruction, knowledge and the benefit of their personal experience and the benefit of their own thinking on a subject which is undoubtedly not only affecting us today but even more so will affect us in the coming years. With those few words and with my grateful thanks, I beg leave to withdraw my Motion.

<P>

<a name="50614-05_time0"></a><H5>5.30 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara </B>   rose to call attention to the current state of aviation liberalisation in the European Union, and in particular to the competence of the European Commission in negotiating aviation agreements with third countries; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am pleased to be able to introduce this debate today. It is some little while since we have debated aviation in this House and there are a number of developments taking place at the moment which I believe make this debate timely.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para2"></a>I would first of all like to reflect on why aviation is so important to us in this country. Aviation is a great British success story. In British Airways we have one of the world's most successful major airlines and one of the few that is profitable. That was not achieved easily and great credit is due to my noble friend Lord King, under whose leadership the airline was turned round from near bankruptcy to a successful privatisation and now to a world leader. But we also have a number of smaller airlines that have done much to improve customer choice <P>


<a name="column_1831"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1831</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and service. I am thinking in particular of British Midland, Virgin Atlantic, Air UK, in the charter market Britannia, and many others.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para3"></a>At this point I should perhaps declare a non-interest in that I am a director of a small airline in the Channel Islands. But as the Channel Islands are not part of the EU, nor with a fleet of Trislanders and a Shorts 360 is the airline thinking of starting transatlantic services, it is not covered by the terms of today's debate.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para4"></a>All the airlines I have mentioned are operating successfully in the private sector, and it is the presence of these competitors to BA that has done so much to bring fares down and improve service to the people who we should be most concerned about, the passengers, whether business or leisure travellers. That is, after all, the main purpose of liberalisation. Incidentally, for proof of that one need look no further than the enormous improvements on our own domestic routes, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, since competition was allowed in the early 1980s.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para5"></a>Our geographical position in Europe makes us probably more dependent on air travel than any other major European country and is one of the reasons why we have the busiest airports in Europe. In 1990, about 15 million business journeys took place through our airports, and that figure is expected to double by the turn of the century. The majority of those will be to and from Europe, where we have more than 60 per cent. of our trade. In 1990&#151;I am afraid I do not have any more up-to-date figures&#151;UK companies spent some &#163;6.4 billion, or 1.3 per cent. of UK GDP, on air fares. This proves the need for our Government, and our European partners, to do what they can to create the conditions for a more liberal market and better value for money for the business passenger, and hence for the process of liberalisation that has been going on for some 10 years to continue.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para6"></a>It was indeed some 10 years ago that I first stood at the Dispatch Box answering questions on the subject, mainly from the late Lady Burton of Coventry. We should pay tribute to her persistence and vigour in keeping the House informed, and the Government up to the mark, on the progress, or lack of it, that we were making. I should also pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Bethell, who I am delighted is taking part in this debate, for all that he did to further the cause.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para7"></a>This country led the way in liberalisation, and because we felt the Community was moving too slowly we negotiated our own liberal bilateral agreements with like-minded countries such as the Netherlands in advance of the Community as a whole. Aviation agreements had previously been conducted on a purely bilateral basis, largely modelled on the 1946 Bermuda agreement between the UK and the United States. These air service agreements gave the right to fly between two countries, and the three main elements were capacity, designation of airlines and fares.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para8"></a>Typically, the first of these, capacity&#151;in other words, the number of flights between the two countries&#151;was shared 50:50 by the airlines of the two countries. Designation covered the airlines allowed to operate on the route, and was usually only one from each country. The third element, fares, had to be agreed by the governments <P>


<a name="column_1832"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1832</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or aeronautical authorities of both countries. It will therefore be self-evident that until these rigid restrictions could be broken down there could be no real competition and hence no downward pressure on fares. So the process of liberalisation began in Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, will remember this well as he was commissioner with responsibility at the time. I pay tribute to him for his efforts against sometimes great resistance from certain quarters.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para9"></a>In gradual steps capacity was broken down from 50:50 to 60:40 and then unlimited. Countries were allowed to designate more than one airline on a route, and the system of double-approval of fares was changed to one of double-disapproval; in other words, where both countries had to disallow a proposed fare before it could be stopped, so one country could not stop a lower fare on its own. I hope noble Lords, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, will forgive me if I may have perhaps rather over-simplified what are very complicated issues.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para10"></a>But if we were to have a true common market&#151;I am a great believer in the European common market&#151;then we had to move to a position where any European airline could operate freely on any route in the EC, whether between countries other than one in which the airline was registered or even with another country&#151;cabotage. In other words, a British airline should be allowed to operate not only between London and Paris but between Paris and Frankfurt and between Frankfurt and Berlin. These and other matters were the subject of the second and third packages, the last of which came into force on 1st January 1993. No doubt my noble friend the Minister will be able to bring us up to date on the progress of that stage.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para11"></a>I said earlier that the main purpose of all this was to bring down fares and improve service for the passenger, so let us see what has happened on a typical route, London to Paris. Since 1990 this has been transformed into one of the most competitive routes in Europe, with six airlines flying from four London airports battling for 4 million passengers a year against 2.8 million in 1990. Before British Midland's entry in 1990, the cheapest business class tariff with BA and Air France was &#163;240. Now British Midland offers a Eurobudget fare at &#163;205 and another airline offers one at &#163;192. That represents a very worthwhile saving, particularly in view of inflation in the intervening years. Now contrast that with Air France fares on three other big routes with fewer competitors: Paris to Rome, okay a bit further, but &#163;820; Paris to Frankfurt at &#163;452; and Paris to Amsterdam at &#163;403. Economy fares have also tumbled, with fares as low as &#163;77 return being offered on this route. In other words, as we all know, competition works.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para12"></a>Incidentally, it is also good for UK plc; where there are two British airlines on a route, the overall share of the market held by British airlines has on the whole risen dramatically, sometimes by nearly 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para13"></a>So I believe liberalisation in Europe is working well and has the potential to work even better. But, sadly, there is one particularly big black cloud up there in the sky, and I refer to the issue of state subsidy. Since 1991 some European airlines have been allowed to receive about &#163;6.8 billion of state aid. State aid is illegal under Article 92.1 of the treaty if it has the potential to distort competition between member states. But so far the Commission has <P>


<a name="column_1833"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1833</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shown little stomach to tackle the issue, although it has said it must stop. Our Government are taking the Commission to the European Court over the Air France case. I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister can tell us how that is getting on.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para14"></a>The new Commissioner, Mr. Kinnock, will shortly have to pass his first big test as I understand there are three cases currently before him. There are new applications from Air France and Iberia and a breach of conditions by Aer Lingus. The acid test is whether Mr. Kinnock will stick to the words of his predecessor that there should be no more subsidies or whether he will cave in under pressure from the governments involved. I hope the message will go out to him from all sides of this House that he should stand firm.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para15"></a>In 1993 the Commission set up a so-called comit&#233; des sages to study the problems of the European airline industry and to draw up an action plan for the future. Financial losses, amounting to some 2 billion dollars in 1992 alone had led some to suggest that liberalisation should be delayed or even reversed. The comit&#233;'s highly commendable report was surprisingly unequivocal.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Liberalisation of the internal market as now defined by community law should be fully implemented in the marketplace and all remaining obstacles to fair competition should be removed".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para16"></a>It goes on to say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"state subsidy, ownership and control and other competition-distorting factors still prevent the system from operating on even terms".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para17"></a>That is clear enough. State aid has the potential to kill off the new market regime, even before it has got fully under way. Free from pressures to adapt to changing circumstances, state aided airlines can simply undercut their competitors to maintain or even expand their market share and eventually to drive them out of the market altogether. But restructuring is possible without state aid. As I said earlier, British Airways did it in 1981, became profitable in 1983 and has been ever since. More recently Lufthansa restructured, moving from 80 per cent. state owned to 40 per cent., all done by raising money in conventional capital markets. It is painful but it can be done, and must be done if good airlines are not to be driven out by the bad, leaving the passenger with no competition and rising fares.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para18"></a>One must question whether every country in Europe needs a national flag carrier if we are in a truly Common Market. I believe this question will have to be faced before very long, and the answer will be pretty unpalatable to some. So the Commission still has a lot of work to do in Europe, which makes me wonder why it should now be distracting us, and itself, by trying to stop individual countries negotiating aviation agreements with third countries, in particular the United States. This issue is particularly timely as I understand that it is to be discussed at the Transport Council next week.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para19"></a>Let us look at the background to the issue with the USA. Europe/North America is the biggest intercontinental air transport market in the world. The UK/USA market is easily the largest, with almost as many passengers as the next three, US/Germany, US/France and US/Holland, put together. These four markets account for three-quarters of all Europe/US passengers. So UK/US is about 37 per cent. of the grand total, and of <P>


<a name="column_1834"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1834</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this British airlines have just over half the market. So our airlines have nearly 20 per cent. of the total Europe/US market. For this reason negotiations with the US are of critical importance to our industry, and they have been going on more or less continuously for many years now. Indeed a mini-deal was concluded only last week which I hope my noble friend will tell us about. The final part of that deal was that the two governments should begin work immediately on the next stage of negotiations with the aim of opening up further opportunities, and so we go on.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para20"></a>There are a number of fundamental issues that have to be resolved if the EU is ultimately to conduct these negotiations. Sir Colin Marshall, Chairman of BA, summed them up in a speech he made earlier this year:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This raises some very profound questions for commerce and industry, not least here in Britain. What policies will the Commission pursue, on behalf of the European industry? What mechanisms would be set up for involving member states and airlines in the process of negotiation? How will the Commission ensure that aviation matters continue to be dealt with on their merits rather than become involved in broader issues of international trade? Would the Commission self-evidently do a better job for the industry and the consumer than the national government?".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para21"></a>I say that the answer is no. These negotiations are extremely complicated and highly technical and there simply is no one in the Commission with the expertise to handle them. I was much involved in the negotiations following the collapse of PanAm and TWA and the transfer of their routes to United and American. The Americans started by thinking it would be a straightforward transfer and were somewhat taken aback when we ventured to suggest that there was a price to be paid. I believe that we got a good deal for this country and although BA criticised us at the time, the US Government were even more strongly criticised by their airlines, so I think we got it just about right. So I am pleased that Sir Colin went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The department of Transport has set a very high standard. If the EU were to negotiate, as a whole, with the USA, what would there be to stop a new route to London by American or United being traded for rights into the USA for say TAP, Iberia or Olympic? The situation would be wholly untenable. Collective EU bargaining cannot, I suggest, be achieved until hard and fast rules are established to govern the way the Commission would undertake such responsibilities and, especially, how it would allocate concessions and resolve disputes".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para22"></a>The important point to make&#151;I am not sure that the Commission has grasped this&#151;is that these negotiations are commercial, not political. I shall give just one example. The revenue which can be generated by the right to operate a daily Boeing 747 flight from Heathrow to New York is over 100 million dollars a year.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para23"></a>At Question Time on 22nd May my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham asked what was meant by open skies. The US version simply removes some of the barriers to free trade&#151;actually the ones that it does not like. True open skies would mean a genuine unified market involving free access to markets within the area, the ability to set up or acquire a business in any part of the area without restrictions on nationality of ownership or control, freedom as to the movement of capital and many other issues. One day there may be a role for the Commission to negotiate that, but in the meantime I end with a quote from the Financial Times leader of 7th June:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The EU's first priority should be to enforce real competition and effective disciplines on state aids in the airline industry. These are the issues on which Brussels genuinely needs to assert its authority over <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1835"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1835</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>member states. Once Mr. Kinnock has shown he is up to that task, it may be appropriate for the EU to discuss his ambitions to play a bigger international role. Meanwhile, he should stop gazing wistfully at transatlantic skies and concentrate on those closer to home".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para24"></a>I say "Hear, hear" to that. I beg to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_time1"></a><H5>5.47 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for introducing this important topic. The noble Lord is knowledgeable about this question and one might even think that his family has a family monopoly having practically invented civil aviation themselves.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para25"></a>The two aspects of the noble Lord's Motion are joined together in a slightly different way from the way he argued. I completely agree with him that it is important that liberalisation and competition be introduced in the entire EU aviation market. It would be good for Her Majesty's Government to make strong representations on this issue and not allow any of the usual sorts of excuses to be used. We have seen that happening in the steel industry. British Steel is the most efficient producer but quotas have been proposed whereby both efficient and inefficient companies take the same cut in output. We are quite right to reject that. I hope that eventually when the steel industry negotiations are finished it will be recognised that the lead, low-cost companies do not have to sacrifice their output in favour of high-cost companies. I would not propose the same thing for health or housing but I have no problem with that as regards aviation, steel or coal. In those areas market rules must be applied rigorously.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para26"></a>I believe there will be much resistance, trading off and "log rolling" about this matter. But be it in the Council of Ministers, be it in the meeting of transport Ministers or be it in the inter-governmental conference, we must make it quite clear that we regard the European Union as a single market which was negotiated eight years ago. It is about time we had a proper single market established in every industry that one can think of. Civil aviation is an important industry in that regard.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para27"></a>The UK has the advantage of being the most efficient country as regards this industry we are discussing and it has borne the costs of making adjustments already. Therefore it is time that we pressed other nations to do that too. It is clear that Mr. Kinnock, the EU commissioner for transport, will have to be very tough on Spain, France and other countries which want to continue state aid to their airlines.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para28"></a>I agree with the noble Lord when he says that there is no reason for every nation state to have its own flag carrier. There is no logic in that. As technological change occurs in the industry and more and more people want to fly we shall see a great many mergers and combinations. State airlines will not be well equipped to withstand that kind of competition. Therefore, it is in the interests of the European Community to press liberalisation and show a competitive front.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para29"></a>When it comes to the second question we may have differences. I do not see a distinction either in time or concept between negotiations with the United States and the liberalisation of airlines. As we know to our cost, <P>


<a name="column_1836"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when it comes to international negotiations, say with France, even within an EU framework we have to do it both at the intergovernmental level and also within the Community framework.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para30"></a>In bargaining with the United States we are confronted with an unequal opposite number. The United States has a much larger aviation industry, although the UK has the second largest industry. The US has six out of 10 air carriers and two-thirds of business, measured either in miles or in numbers of flights. Therefore, there is a very large competitor with whom we have to negotiate and, while it is true that individual airlines such as British Airways and Virgin are large companies and efficient bargainers, it may still be to the advantage of European airlines as a group not to allow the Americans to divide and rule. They may start, as they already have, negotiating with smaller countries. That may erode the advantage that we might be able to negotiate. For example, if the US starts by negotiating with Austria, Portugal or Greece it may be able to gain the advantage of intermediate stops&#151;the so-called fifth freedom&#151;which might be to the disadvantage of the UK.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para31"></a>In negotiations in the Uruguay Round of GATT the principle followed by the Community was that the European Commissioner&#151;Sir Leon Brittan&#151;negotiated on behalf of all countries. That proved tremendously advantageous, especially in the final stages when a lot of pressure was placed on Community countries by the United States both individually and collectively.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para32"></a>Bilateral negotiations take place all the time, and the relative strength of the two partners comes into play. Even the EU aviation industry as a whole, much less that of the UK on its own, will not measure up to the American aviation industry. The American industry is much larger than that of any single European country.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para33"></a>Therefore, there is a genuine dilemma. I respect what the noble Lord said. He believes that bilateral negotiations are a better bet, and perhaps a quicker bet. I wonder whether it is not better for the EU to negotiate on behalf of all European air carriers and secure advantages for Europe as a whole which will not be to the disadvantage of any one country.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para34"></a>I gather from reading such information as has been issued by the Commission that if, when the EU has negotiated an agreement with the US, any individual country has a better agreement that country will not lose out. That is an important principle. The EU has promised that if any air carrier has a better deal from the US than the EU has secured it will not have to give up the freedom that it has achieved. That is a no-lose situation. We are not likely to lose as a result.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para35"></a>Other noble Lords may know more about that and may go into detail. It is not a party matter. It is partly a matter of technical knowledge. However, if it is true that such a no-loss situation exists, we should think carefully whether we should not approach this on two fronts and try to pursue the advantage of a multilateral strategy as far as we can in order to fend off any attempt by the United States to play off one European carrier against another.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para36"></a>Therefore, inasmuch as during the GATT negotiations that principle worked&#151;and I dare say that in matters of international trade and commodities life is no more competitive in Europe or within the United States, or <P>


<a name="column_1837"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between the two, than in civil aviation&#151;it was a good principle to rely on the combined negotiating strength of 12 (now 15) countries. That produced an advantage.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para37"></a>I believe that I am correct in saying that to the extent that individual countries can offer negotiating teams to strengthen the Commission's own negotiating team that would be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para38"></a>I do not want to continue for too long. I want only to say that the multilateral strategy will have advantages and no disadvantages. The multilateral strategy will have to be pursued at the same time as the liberalisation of civil aviation within the EU. I do not see any conflict. Some noble Lords may argue&#151;and I should like to hear the argument&#151;that in pursuing a multilateral bargaining strategy some countries may want derogation or concessions to preserve their subsidies. We have to reject that path. The elimination of state subsidies has to be a priority. I regard multilateral negotiations as a second option, and we should pursue both strategies.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para39"></a>Perhaps the noble Viscount who will reply from the Dispatch Box can answer a question for me. In legal terms the Community has competence in this matter. There may be some peculiar legal problems, because I am told that under a judgment of the European Court the EU has competence which overrides the competence of individual countries. I should be grateful if the noble Viscount could clarify that point for me without causing too much riot on his Back Benches, either here or in the other place. If that is the case, that is another problem: how do we pursue the bilateral advantages which the UK may gain while keeping within the law that we have agreed to?

<P>
<A NAME="50614-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara for raising this matter. At the outset, I must declare an interest. I am a director of British Airways. In fact, I began my career in an airline nearly 40 years ago, and I have had an abiding interest in the airline industry all that time.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para40"></a>I refer back to that era because, however illiberal air transport seems to be in the European Union today, there have been many positive developments. The illiberal nature of the air transport sector has already been described by my noble friend. He spoke of the carving up of routes, pooled routes and so on, and referred to a cartel by any other name. Sadly, the pace of development in terms of liberalisation has been slowing down and now seems to have come to a full stop.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para41"></a>It is important that this debate should not degenerate into another series of carping criticisms of the European Union. I would much prefer that we came up with some ideas as to how to help the Commission to achieve liberalisation, because at present it appears to be at an impasse.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para42"></a>The nub of the problem, which has already been eloquently stated by my noble friend Lord Brabazon, is the unacceptable existence of huge state subsidies to national airlines. Those are condoned by the Commission. It really is ludicrous. On the one hand there are demands <P>


<a name="column_1838"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for cheaper air fares, greater customer service, and so on; and on the other European Union member states are propping up their failed airlines.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para43"></a>Most of what I had planned to say has already been said by my noble friend Lord Brabazon, but in the interests of making sure that the message gets home I shall quickly go through the points, underlining how important it is that we do everything in our power to ensure that free and fair competition is achieved.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para44"></a>The concept of a national airline being seen as a national status symbol has been with us since air transport became more widespread; and it still persists. In the airline business, I remember it being said over 30 years ago, "As soon as the new flag is raised at the ceremony marking independence, the new national airline takes off on its inaugural flight". Some of the countries where this happened have such great needs for resources to cope with their economic and social deprivation that they really cannot afford highly expensive and relatively huge investment in a national airline, but they have made it. That is not necessarily the case in Europe, but the status symbol of a national flag carrying airline persists. Within the European Union there are several countries which support airlines which by no stretch of the imagination could be called efficient or economic. Nor indeed are they giving good service to their customers, despite the heavy load of state aid.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para45"></a>All the market research, all the customer research, which one reads regarding favourite airlines indicates an inverse relationship between those which receive massive state aid and customer esteem for those airlines.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para46"></a>The most recent example of state aid is probably the most blatant to date. Iberia, the Spanish airline, was bailed out to the tune of about &#163;750 million three years ago. The EC gave its approval, but the restructuring package which it was insisted should be put in place at the time of that approval, still has 18 months to run and Iberia is back again with the begging bowl&#151;this time for &#163;660 million. British Airways has stated that it will take the European Commission to the European Court if the Commission approves the latest package, which was arranged, of course, on the basis that airlines find it difficult to exist because of the problems facing them in a highly competitive, unstable and recessionary European situation.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para47"></a>As my noble friend said, since 1991, over &#163;6 billion has been approved by the European Commission. While that level of subsidy is being continued, there is no hope of further liberalisation. State aids must be outlawed before we can even think about allowing the European Commission to negotiate for member states as a whole. To use an overused phrase&#151;it is wholly inappropriate for this debate, but I cannot think of a better one&#151;we must have a level playing field. The phrase, "level skies", I fear, does not mean anything. Although the noble Lord, Lord Desai said&#151;and I was relieved that subsequently he conceded that state aids would have to go&#151;that we were unlikely to lose if the European Commission negotiates for everyone, that cannot be possible.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para48"></a>The European Commission could never be even-handed in the circumstances, while on the one hand approving state aid to airlines, and on the other seeking to negotiate multilateral agreements. We must resist any <P>


<a name="column_1839"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>move to transfer responsibility for aviation agreements from national governments to Brussels while that situation persists.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para49"></a>We recognise that there are genuine problems with airlines and that if there were no state aids there could be quite substantial unemployment problems. Unemployment is the greatest pan-European anxiety. We think that it is purely a British problem: it is not. There are high levels of unemployment in the European Union generally. But there is little honesty around. Those airlines which have slimmed down and concentrated on customer service, and which rank with the best in the world, are at a considerable competitive disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para50"></a>The airline business is tough, but all business is tough. However, I have to say that not as many other businesses are as badly affected by events such as the Gulf War. That is the peg on which Iberia is hanging its new approach. Any major international upset is reflected instantly in passenger numbers and cargo loads. The airlines which are now either benefiting from or appealing for state aids quote international incidents as justification for support. I simply ask the question: how have British Midland, BA, KLM and Lufthansa managed, despite the recession and incidents such as the Gulf War, to continue to operate efficiently and to provide an excellent and essential service?
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para51"></a>There is no free competition in the airline industry in the European Union at present. We need free competition in the airline industry in the European Union. We must press the Commission to strengthen its backbone and resist ever more applications for approval of state aids to airlines in member states. Until that is achieved, Britain must "go it alone" and work out its own aviation agreements.

<P>
<A NAME="50614-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bethell: </B>   My Lords, like the previous speaker I must declare an interest in that I have been the founder of a consumer organisation known as the Freedom of the Skies Campaign which for some 15 years has worked to bring down the costs of European air travel. One must remember that in the early 1980s there was a straitjacket around the whole body of European air travel called the International Air Transport Association. When it ruled the roost, it decided how many prawns there should be in a prawn cocktail; and the cheapest route to London from Copenhagen was via New York. Happily, as previous speakers have pointed out, those days are past. We now have a better regime of fare structures.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para52"></a>However, there is plenty of room for improvement. I support my noble friends Lord Brabazon of Tara and Lady O'Cathain for the constructive proposals that they made regarding state subsidies. Indeed, it is a scandal that those state subsidies have been allowed to proceed.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para53"></a>In the early 1980s I sought to outlaw the pooling arrangements and other restrictive practices of the national airlines by taking them to the courts: first, to <P>


<a name="column_1840"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1840</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the European Court of Justice under Article 173; and then to the High Court in this country for violation of Articles 95 and 96 of the Treaty of Rome. I was not able to succeed in the Luxembourg court because my case was considered not to be admissible, and in the British courts because of the high cost of litigation. Millions of pounds would probably have had to be made available if the matter had been fought to its ultimate conclusion. However, I hope that through the great efforts exerted by the British Government over a period of 15 years some achievements have been made; and perhaps our organisation has contributed a little to them.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para54"></a>I wonder only&#151;perhaps the Minister would like to comment on this&#151;whether there has been a sea change in the Government's attitude to litigation regarding state aids and other restrictive practices. We know that action is being taken against state aids to Air France. Have the Government contemplated taking the Commission to the European Court of Justice for failure to act by putting a stop to those measures?
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para55"></a>As has been pointed out by my noble friend who introduced the debate, there are now many airlines on some European routes. He mentioned the Paris route. Perhaps I may mention the Dutch and Irish routes, and pay tribute to the airlines which pioneered the reduction of fares on flights to the Netherlands and Ireland. British Midland is one of the few airlines which was able to survive the period of recession without going under. Other airlines,&#151;British Caledonian, Air Europe and the sadly-lamented Air Laker were unable to survive and were gobbled up (if that is the right expression) by British Airways. In particular one remembers its merger with British Caledonian.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para56"></a>On the routes to Dublin, other Irish destinations and Amsterdam there is certainly a variety of fares available. Nevertheless, for some bizarre reason, it still costs &#163;205 to fly one way by British Airways from Brussels to London. That is the cheapest economy fare one way, from Brussels to London. The cheapest fare from London to Brussels&#151;exactly the same route&#151;is not &#163;205 but &#163;145. Such are the incomprehensible complications of European air travel.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para57"></a>While there has been progress, I fear that there is still not sufficient diversity in the business. There is not enough competition to bring air fares down to the level which they would reach if they were a truly functioning free market, a common market right across the continent.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para58"></a>The fact seems to be that in Britain we lead the struggle for a free market. As has been pointed out, we are the country that most needs reasonably priced air travel. With very few exceptions our business people and our visitors to the continent have to fly. Of course, there is a change now that the Channel Tunnel is available, but by and large we have to fly because of the barrier of the Channel between us and our markets. In this arena British Airways is still far and away the biggest beast in the jungle. The other day I read that British Airways still controls 90 per <P>


<a name="column_1841"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cent. of British scheduled flights to the continent of Europe. I wonder whether the Minister will be able to confirm that when he winds up.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para59"></a>British Midland and the Irish airline, Ryan Air, are the only two airlines able seriously to compete with British Airways. They do not have many routes at their disposal and are not able to provide the range of services that the big British airline still dominates. I do not know quite how the Government should tackle the problem. They may care to consider whether British Airways remains within the bounds of Article 96 of the treaty that prevents one enterprise from dominating a route. However, it would be desirable if more British airlines and continental airlines were available to cover this important market. We have made great progress in liberalising the market but the Government or the Commission can only take a horse to the water, they cannot make it drink. They cannot make an airline charge cheap fares if the airline feels that it will go bankrupt if it does and as so many airlines have done during the recent difficult years.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para60"></a>I hope that the Government will also look at the privileges still enjoyed by the large airlines in this country and on the continent. The automatic appearance of a great airline, for example, on a computer reservation system is a factor that encourages many travellers to take the big airline rather than the cheaper, modest-sized airline. It is the large airline that is offered to most travellers who consult travel agencies, and privileges are offered by the large airlines to travel agents' employees.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para61"></a>It is also suggested that the big airlines, including BA, enjoy privileges at the big airports of the Community. Therefore, they have a great advantage in that respect. But there is no excuse for the state subsidies that are applied not to British airlines but to those across the Channel, as has been pointed out by my noble friend Lady O'Cathain and others. There is no reason why we should tolerate the continuance of state subsidies paid year after year to Air France, Iberia and other airlines. I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, nodding, I am sure he will have much to say about it in a few moments.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para62"></a>It may be that a government wish to subsidise their social policy, their regional policy, to reduce their unemployment or even to contribute to their defence. But that should not be at the expense of the taxpayer or the fare-paying traveller. It should come out of the budgets under those headings. Hidden subsidies such as the training of pilots should also be considered and outlawed.
<P>

<a name="50614-05_para63"></a>I hope that the Government will look at all those ways in which the Commission is failing in its task to protect the interests of the European air traveller. If I may say so, it very much strengthens the view recently put forward by Mr. Douglas Hurd that the Commission ought to concentrate on improving its own performance in the areas where it has a clear duty and responsibility, rather than venturing into new pastures and new arenas where its competence has yet to be proved. I hope that Mr. Kinnock will be able to make progress in the area where his predecessors <P>

Will he acknowledge that cheap scheduled air fares between London and Switzerland are available? The fact that Switzerland is not in the EU may have something to do with that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bethell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has a point. Another point to be made is that Swissair is one of the few airlines in Europe to be entirely privately owned.

<A NAME="50614-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mountevans: </B>   My Lords, I share the pleasure of joining in thanking my noble friend Lord Brabazon for giving us this opportunity to debate our airline industry in a European and transatlantic context. His exposition of the main issues was excellent. My only regret is that his speech and those that followed have left me with little to do but agree with the sentiments expressed. I hope, however, that I can add my little mite to the debate.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para0"></a>Let me start by mentioning two airline ticket stubs in my possession&#151;each of them kept because they were major steps in my life. The first is a Delta economy excursion ticket from Knoxville, Tennessee, to London via Atlanta and a PanAm code share. The date was December 1969 and the fare 414 US dollars. Despite it being a restricted fare, despite Gulf wars, oil shocks, inflation and exchange rate variations, that fare is now available and is in fact slightly lower. Airlines have made a great deal of progress in reducing fares in the 25 years since I bought that ticket, especially the professional heavyweights like Delta. My other ticket is a 1973 British European Airways ticket stub&#151;which dates the story a little&#151;from Heathrow to Stockholm at &#163;144. With the restrictions slightly changed, it is still available at a slightly lower rate even now.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para1"></a>I feel that both transatlantic and European liberalisation is an achievement for which we, the consumers, should be grateful to all those governments, commissioners and airlines who have influenced the scene. I have no doubt that the airline product is a better value one, in most instances more readily available than ever before.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para2"></a>But it is not only the fares and flights&#151;the most customer visible elements&#151;which we should consider. We should not overlook the success of BAA plc; or of the major local authority airports in the country. They too have made a big contribution to both customer satisfaction and to our export earning, as has the CAA, especially through the air traffic control system. As my noble friend Lord Brabazon reminded us&#151;and my noble friend Lord Caithness gave us the details during Question Time on 22nd May&#151;British carriers dominate the Europe to North America traffic. But many of those European and American passengers who choose, for whatever reason, a foreign airline, <P>


<a name="column_1843"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contribute to our earnings because of our unique position at the eastern end of the great circle route and our ATC input.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para3"></a>Mention of the great circle reminds me that, as I speak, there are a number of European airbuses, and indeed quite a large number of Rolls-Royce engines, flying the great circle route. So there is a fourth pillar to the aviation industry. We must take care of all of them, and not think simply in terms of airlines. If European or transatlantic liberalisation goes wrong, all four will suffer.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para4"></a>However, that is not to say that everything is perfect if one looks at Europe. I would not dream of saying that. As several noble Lords have said, if we cannot absolutely eliminate state subsidy to national carriers, it must be controlled. Like others who have spoken tonight, I admire Sir Michael Bishop's achievements at British Midland. I admire him the more when I recall that on two major routes, London to Paris and London to Dublin, British Midland competes with Air France and Aer Lingus. In spite of the conclusions of the comit&#233; des sages&#151;my noble friend Lord Brabazon summarised those conclusions&#151;these airlines have access to a bottomless fund, an illegal fund under EC rules, of bail-out state subsidies. Air France competes with British carriers on price, and with Aer Lingus on price; but its advertisements are also dominated by frequency, reliability and quality of service.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para5"></a>That is not the whole story. If as a result of what can only be called commercial incompetence, either Air France or Aer Lingus moves towards failure, it simply receives more state subsidy from its state owners. It then receives a subsidy for the last time, and then it receives another load of subsidy from what might be called the "last chance subsidy saloon".
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para6"></a>My noble friend Lady O'Cathain mentioned Iberia and how it got into trouble in 1992, pleading the Gulf War in aid. I believe I am right in saying that in 1992 Spain had the Olympics; it had Expo in Seville; and Madrid was the European capital of culture. If you have three golden carrots of that sort which fill your planes I find it very difficult to see how you can go wrong. Even more ironic in the Iberian context is that I gather it is now going to court, and one of the petitioners is TAP, which is not totally innocent in the subsidy field either, as I recall.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para7"></a>Such subsidies distort competition and, just as importantly, discriminate against not only our own carriers but other foreign private-owned carriers. The liberalised European regime, if it continues to tolerate subsidies and discriminate against private enterprise, must get its act together. It must get together the regulation, the control and the monitoring of those subsidies.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para8"></a>State aid should, as Air UK reminded me, be once-off; be wisely used; and be thoroughly monitored by Brussels. I hope that in winding up this debate all Front Bench Speakers will remind Commissioner Kinnock that abuse of state aid should be his first priority. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Goschen <P>


<a name="column_1844"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will do so. And in so doing, I hope that he will confirm that subsidy is the biggest threat to fair and equal competition.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para9"></a>I turn to the transatlantic&#151;or perhaps we should widen it and call it the third party&#151;negotiating position that Brussels is exploring. Like my noble friend Lord Brabazon, I find this unacceptable in the short term, though like my noble friend I take on board Sir Colin Marshall's Brancker Memorial Lecture remarks, and especially those regarding hard-and-fast rules governing the Commission's conduct of such responsibilities should they ever arise; the allocation of concessions; and the resolution of disputes. I might say that much of that also applies to the European scene. Such rules seem to me a very, very long way away. They seem to me so far away that one might eventually have very nearly global open skies&#151;in which case, both the Brussels role and the present bilateral role seem to fall away. But until then, and in the short term, I very much hope that the Government will fight to preserve the present bilateral status. I also hope that in so doing, they have the support of the parties opposite.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para10"></a>I should like to make two final points. They are outside the strict terms of the Motion and also outside the responsibilities of my noble friend Lord Goschen. Nonetheless, I hope that he will ensure that airport departure tax is never looked upon as a levy to be increased at will. I also hope that carriers' liability&#151;medieval, as my noble friend Lord King once called it&#151;will be equably enforced on all airlines, and indeed maritime carriers. One must be concerned that diplomatic judgments are allowed to override the level playing fields for which so many of us have looked in other contexts this evening.

<A NAME="50614-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that this evening I am once again an amateur in a Chamber full of professionals, or at least experts, in this matter. I shall try to be brief and confine myself to three major points. The first has not been touched upon by anybody in this debate. I introduce it with a certain amount of fear. On the other hand, everything that has been said, and all the briefings that I was sent and have obtained, assume that air traffic will inexorably and continuously increase and that that is a desirable and indeed major objective of the whole liberalisation policy. In that context I do not feel that I can let the environmental point go entirely unmentioned.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para11"></a>I draw the attention of the House briefly to two particular recommendations from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, one of which was that increased competition within the European Community should be accompanied by a full assessment of the environmental implications. The other is that the UK Government's policies should be to encourage transfer from air to rail, particularly for domestic or near European journeys, and the upgrading of rail links to main airports to discourage air feeder services.
<P>


<a name="column_1845"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para12"></a>I shall not say that all the suggestions that the Royal Commission (it made seven recommendations in relation to air policy) should be adopted. They may not all be feasible. I am not scientifically equipped to determine that. But in the light of government commitment to sustainable development, do the Government share the broad approach that the demand for air transport cannot be satisfied for ever without very severe damage to our environment? I draw noble Lords' attention again to the Royal Commission report, which states in paragraph 5.39:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An unquestioning attitude towards future growth in air travel, and an acceptance that the projected demand for additional services and facilities must be met, is incompatible with the aim of sustainable development".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para13"></a>All my remarks should be read within those constraints. Like the noble Lord, Lord Desai, for example, I am not in the least opposed to liberalisation, provided that standards of safety and so on can be maintained, and that the entire burden of that liberalisation is not entirely borne by the employees in the various companies. Also, I believe that my party is in general committed to a competitive approach, to a competition-oriented approach, to industrial policy; and more particularly to ensuring that private monopolies do not succeed state monopolies. I believe that that point was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bethell.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para14"></a>The second point that I wish to address is the competence of the Commission. As I understand it, the Commission's certainty of its own competence stems from the implementation of the single market. In respect of air transport&#151;as people have said to me, transport always seems to lag behind other industries in this sort of respect&#151;the implementation of the single market should be completed by 1997. That completion would involve such things as full cabotage, which was an issue addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara; and the possibility of mergers between other companies and open access to routes and airports, which were points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bethell, in particular with reference to the smaller airlines. Presumably completion of that process would lead to the cheaper fares to which the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, referred and which probably we would all like to see. The noble Lord, Lord Bethell, has been a doughty campaigner in that regard.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para15"></a>It is out of the involvement with the single market that the Commission draws its claim for competence and also as a result of its existing role as a negotiator, for example, with and within GATT, on international affairs. It is so confident that it has declared its intention to take out legal proceedings against Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden and Finland because they have initiated open-skies deals with the United States.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para16"></a>How, therefore, do the Government justify their opposition to the Commission's competence when confronted by that level of certainty? Is the Government's opposition temporary, pending either completion of the single market or some other event? Does the Government's scepticism about Community competence extend to an unwillingness to allow it to operate in such a way as to facilitate a more integrated air traffic control system, for example? That is becoming increasingly more urgent because of the <P>


<a name="column_1846"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>growth of air traffic, and the airlines themselves very much want to ensure that it takes place. What reaction will the Minister have to what I thought was the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, that the Commission could be competent in international negotiations at some point at which sufficient rules about competence have been agreed between the member states? Will it be part of the Government's policy to attempt to agree such rules?
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para17"></a>At one point, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, seemed to suggest that the UK should seek routes within continental Europe but should fear the trade-off which might result if the Commission takes on international negotiations. For example, in obtaining a benefit from the United States, it might be willing to grant a particular form of access into the United Kingdom. I found that an interesting way of looking at the situation from someone who is in favour of liberalisation. Presumably "liberalisation" means that our own routes and internal national markets should be as open as everybody else's. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in response to that and look forward to his reply.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para18"></a>Finally, there is the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, about the relative advantage to be obtained&#151;my reference to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, leads on to this point&#151;by negotiating as a single country or as a group of countries in this matter. I shall not repeat all that the noble Lord said, but there is a problem with the comparative strength of the international countries in that respect with the very strong United States' presence in aviation worldwide. The United States already has certain concessions in our markets which it has been not very willing to give to us in return.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para19"></a>I should like to know, when we are negotiating for open-skies, whether we are indeed looking for the cabotage&#151;that is to say, the ability to fly from (for the sake of argument) Washington to Seattle, as well as into Washington or into Seattle, and in fact even independently of those, which is what "full cabotage" in fact means. Would we, in fact, be able to negotiate that level of agreement and opening of the US markets unless we are willing to grant a level of European freedom in compensation?
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para20"></a>As I say, the question of liberalisation cuts both ways. Indeed, has not the United States indicated its concept of its own powers by virtually announcing its intention to pick off the smaller countries&#151;in fact, those that are currently facing action by the Community&#151;before concluding negotiations with the UK?
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para21"></a>In response to another point raised, will the Government reassure the airline industry about the method of international negotiation that is normally undertaken by the Commission? If we take as an example the GATT negotiations, the Commission officials who do the negotiating are nearly always accompanied by not merely national representatives but also by industry representatives. The Commission does not exclude either of those two important parties when it is dealing on behalf of the Community as a whole.

<P>

<a name="50614-06_para22"></a>I have asked a number of questions. I hope that I shall receive some answers. Meanwhile, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, for initiating this debate.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_time2"></a><H5>6.36 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, first, I wish to declare two interests. One is that I am the current president of the British Airline Pilots Association, though I must add immediately that my views do not coincide in several major respects with those of the association. So, whether I shall be asked to continue as president remains to be seen. I get on with the association very well. My second interest is that, I was a commissioner in this area. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, for what he said about the efforts that I and my colleagues in the Commission made between 1985 and 1989 to get the first steps going. I had that interest and I shall reflect a little about that in a moment and about the chronology of events which have taken place.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para23"></a>As others have done, I should like to congratulate the noble, Lord Brabazon, who has ministerial experience in this field, on initiating the debate and on raising a number of salient issues. As he said, the debate is timely because it enables us to review progress in liberalisation and to consider the position of the bilateral agreement which has recently been struck with the United States. So far as that agreement is concerned, the debate enables us to look at the more fundamental long-term objectives. It also enables us to consider the rationale underlying the draft mandate which has been submitted by the Commission to the Council and which, I understand, is to be debated before the Council of Ministers next week. The Commission claims that it has exclusive competence to conduct air service negotiations with third countries and with the United States in particular on behalf of the European Union. I should like to look at that matter in some greater depth in a moment.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para24"></a>Perhaps I may consider these matters in the order in which I have just stated them. It follows the line taken by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. So far as concerns progress in liberalisation, the first steps, to which I have alluded, were agreed in 1986 but did not come into operation until 1987, because there was the problem over Gibraltar which held things up for a year. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, will remember that only too well. Incidentally, I want to thank him for all the support that he and his Government gave to the Commission at that time. It was not full progress of course but simply the first vital steps in creating a common market in air transport.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para25"></a>In the European Parliament, I was very often pressed by the noble Lord, Lord Bethell, who wanted to go much further than I thought was practical at the time. That was the dispute between us. We were doing it on a step-by-step basis&#151;which I thought was the only basis upon which one could proceed&#151;but having regard to the enormous frenzied opposition that he will recall was evoked from a number of member states, even to go so far as we were proposing was too far for many of them. Eventually they saw the light, albeit in a limited way, and we were able to proceed with the first stage.
<P>


<a name="column_1848"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1848</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para26"></a>Then we had the second and third packages, which were agreed in 1993 and allowed European airlines to operate under a single air licence, enabling them to fly between any European Union country. That is to be further developed in 1997 when airlines will be at liberty to operate domestic services in other member states. That is real progress, as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, indicated. At the same time&#151;this goes back before my time as commissioner, though it was developed in those four years also&#151;regional air services have been developing and will continue to progress. And all that is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para27"></a>However, as the noble Lord rightly said, a heavy item appears on the debit side. I refer to the recent sanctioning by the previous Commission of state aids to Air France and, on a lesser scale, to Aer Lingus, Sabena, TAP and Olympic Airways. Earlier in 1992 the first tranche of state aid to Iberia was approved and it is now requesting a further tranche.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para28"></a>I have said previously in this House and elsewhere that it was wrong of the Comit&#233; des Sages, to which the noble Lord made reference earlier&#151;he said he approved of the report, which was helpful in many respects&#151;to contemplate further "once-and-for-all" provisions of state aid (the "last chance saloon" doctrine) even if they were to be subject to substantial conditions. That situation has happened before, but the requests did not stop. I do not believe that they will stop in the future.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para29"></a>My view is that there should be no more chances. But let us not underestimate the task that now faces Commissioner Kinnock. First, we have the framework operating under the guidelines of the Comit&#233; des Sages; we then have the decision of the previous Commission&#151;that was an unfortunate precedent and to some extent the commissioner may be imprisoned by it. I hope that that is not so and that when he reflects upon these matters, while we have a great deal of sympathy with his personal situation and that of the present Commission, he will in fact decide that there is to be no more sanctioning of state aid. There may be special circumstances, but they are narrow in their limitation and that must be the prevailing doctrine.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para30"></a>There is no question but that such aid distorts competition; it confers unfair competitive advantages which have not been earned, and that is the point. It was therefore damaging in the extreme when the Commission took its position in the latter part of 1994. I understand the pressures that were imposed upon President Delors. He wanted to be a candidate at the time and it was difficult in those circumstances to turn down Air France. In those specific circumstances the whole thing should have been put into touch until the new Commission took over. That would have been easier. I am glad that the Government as well as BA are challenging the position of Air France state aid. I wish them well in that litigation.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para31"></a>We come now to the agreement with the United States. That agreement, which was recently negotiated, is very modest, as the Government will concede. Further discussions are to take place shortly which will elaborate on that position. It must be viewed against the changes in our air services relationship with the United States since 1977, when we reviewed the Bermuda agreement. <P>


<a name="column_1849"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1849</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I was aviation Minister at that time, a position later occupied by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. The results of the negotiation have rankled with the United States authorities ever since. It ended the substantial dominance which had been enjoyed by the United States airlines on the Atlantic routes, which we found plainly unacceptable, and provided instead a framework enabling competition to take place on broadly equal terms.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para32"></a>That is the background. Even against the latest deal, which is quite modest, the United States appears to be dissatisfied with the outcome. It believes that United States carriers were not given sufficient opportunities to serve London and beyond, but it must not assume that the overall benefits from the negotiations can be only one-way&#151;the United States way. I wish our negotiators well in those further discussions.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para33"></a>Then I come to the question of the Commission's draft mandate. I am pleased that this debate has not taken on the tone of a principled opposition, as some have said in relation to the Commission's proposals. The test for those few of us on these Benches is: what is best for Europe and for British aviation in particular? A pragmatic approach, which I encapsulated in that one sentence, is shared by British airlines&#151;by British Airways in particular&#151;and by the Civil Aviation Authority. Neither we nor they see this in simplistic Thatcherite terms&#151;always saying "No, no, no" to anything to do with Brussels, almost regardless of the issue. We do not see this as a belligerent attempt by the Commission to extend its competence. The Commission entertains the view that a mandate along the lines it suggested, perhaps amended in part by the member states, would be in the best interests of European Union aviation, as stated by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, a moment ago. I do not necessarily agree with that conclusion, though it is a perfectly respectable argument. It has some logic in law because the legal position of the Commission is based on the case law of the European Court of Justice in the judgment of AETR in 1971, confirmed by an opinion in November 1994, according to which,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In particular, each time the Community, with a view to implementing a common policy envisaged by the Treaty, adopts provisions laying down common rules, whatever form these may take, the Member States no longer have the right, acting individually or even collectively, to undertake obligations with third countries which affect those rules".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para34"></a>However, though I am advised that the Commission rests its case on that, I am not convinced that it will be as easy as that. It would be a travesty to suggest that the Commission is bereft of acceptable arguments in favour of its stance. Perhaps I should briefly outline them and touch on my major reservations.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para35"></a>First, member states ceded to the Commission in 1986 not dissimilar powers in relation to shipping. The Minister at the time will recall that. I know that because I negotiated the agreement and even the Government of the day acceded to that proposition. Of course, while the parallel is relevant in legal terms, there are major differences in practice between aviation and shipping. Secondly, over many years the Commission negotiated at the GATT on behalf of member states and again the United Kingdom concurred in that position.
<P>


<a name="column_1850"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para36"></a>Thirdly, the Commission believes that although it is preferable for the issues affecting the mandate to be resolved by diplomatic agreement, it believes that it has the legal right, which may have to be tested in the courts, to negotiate air service agreements on behalf of the Union as a whole. As I say, it is prepared to litigate on this point.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para37"></a>Fourthly, the Commission believes that the bilateral agreements which have been concluded by Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland&#151;and also Switzerland although that country is not within the Union&#151;as well as the United Kingdom, damage the solidarity of the European Union and affront the liberalisation policy which has been pursued. It sees the smaller countries as being "picked off" by the United States, with little being granted in return, and is in conflict, it argues, with the more substantial gains which could be procured on a multilateral basis.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para38"></a>I am not sure where I am as regards the number of points, but I believe that this is the fifth. The Commission rejects the view that it does not have the resources available to undertake the role of negotiator for the reasons that were given by the noble Baroness a moment or two ago. It says that it had that experience in any event in dealing with the former EFTA countries and eastern and central Europe.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para39"></a>The Commission also says that its draft mandate extends to all major issues involving concessions to be made by the United States on cabotage in the United States; relaxing conditions of ownership by United States airlines, mirroring the European Union's own conditions which would enable a foreign airline to acquire up to 49 per cent. of a national airline; pushing for the real opening of the United States internal market and removing all United States discrimination concerning the computer reservation system; and that it will aim at establishing a real "open skies" agreement. If the agreement is less than the one reached by existing bilateral arrangements, then the more liberal agreement will be left untouched.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para40"></a>On the allocation of routes the Commission says that is not all that difficult, but I am not so sure about that. The Commission claims that there has been considerable movement in its favour in the debate on the part of Germany, France, Spain and Denmark and poses the question: if that is so, why is the United Kingdom so hesitant?
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para41"></a>Perhaps I may now briefly turn to the position which I, on behalf of my party, adopt here. Essentially, it is for the Commission to satisfy us that a multilateral system for negotiating air service agreements, now or in the near future, will have positive effects for this country, its airlines and the European Union more generally.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para42"></a>British Airways is Europe's largest and most successful carrier. It is not opposed in principle to the initiative undertaken by the Commission; but not unnaturally, it is concerned about its own North Atlantic routes, which contribute about 40 per cent. towards its operating profits. It is entitled to fight to ensure that evident benefits will result from any change of the regime.
<P>


<a name="column_1851"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para43"></a>British Airways accepts that the deals being struck by the United States with the smaller countries might be objectionable in that they include fifth freedom rights and provisions concerning computer reservation systems which might well be prejudicial. It concedes that if a unified market for the North Atlantic is to be established, which would also cover the domestic markets of the United States and Europe, which it would welcome, it would be for the Commission alone to negotiate such an agreement on behalf of the member states.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para44"></a>But we believe, as it does, that any such agreement must be seen to be beneficial for the industry and that the rules of competition are fair and seen to be fair; that the mechanics for ensuring and enforcing this situation must be firmly in place and that until these points can be agreed the bilateral system has to continue.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para45"></a>Consequently, I believe that it is for the Commission to demonstrate that all the main barriers to free trade, not just those which the United States industry cannot accept, are removed. There must be free access to all markets within the area without limits on capacity and prices. There must be complete freedom for the movement of capital and common rights of establishment without discrimination so far as citizens of the free trade area are concerned. There must be common competition rules and methods of enforcement. There must be rapid and effective sanctions against predatory behaviour. In determining any mandate the Commission's priorities must be very clearly set out, and they are not clearly set out at present.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para46"></a>Equally, the Commission must assert how it will resolve major variations of commercial practice and enforcement in relation to competition. We have to remember the United States anti-trust laws, including the vexed questions of triple damages suits and claims for extra-territorial jurisdiction. They are very different from our own approach to competition law.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para47"></a>The Commission must resolve its approach to the use in the United States of Chapter 11 to sustain airlines which are in or close to a state of bankruptcy&#151;which is not a million miles away, in my view, from the whole question of state aid. The Commission must also resolve once and for all that further state aid to European Union airlines is out. Major practical problems arise in negotiating for 18 European Union airlines operating to the United States, all of whose interests, together with those of airports, regions and cities, have to be reconciled, especially as regards the allocation of routes. After all, airlines have invested very heavily in these routes. That is a matter to which the Commission must pay proper attention. I believe that we are well within time so far as concerns this debate.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para48"></a>The issue, as I have said before, is what is best for Britain and the European Union. I am not opposed in principle to what the European Commission is seeking <P>


<a name="column_1852"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to do. It has to prove that there is a strong and immediate case for it, but I do not believe that it has yet done that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport   (Viscount Goschen): </B>  My Lords, this has been an exceptionally well-informed and topical debate. I thank my noble friend Lord Brabazon for initiating it and for his forceful opening speech.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para49"></a>The debate has happily concentrated on the real world of the airline industry rather than on the more traditional dogma which can sometimes be associated with a debate with a European angle. Indeed, with some surprise I found myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, in much of what he said on the subject. I welcome his condemnation of state aid as being anti-competitive, of which more later.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para50"></a>My noble friend Lord Brabazon is right: the airline industry is big business. What is more, the United Kingdom companies are world leaders in this extremely valuable field. The number of air travellers using our airports totals nearly 124 million a year. It also provides, through direct employment, some 60,000 jobs in the United Kingdom and many more in the supporting service industries. Historically, air transport has been characterised by over-regulation and by complex barriers to trade. The Government's policy has been for some time to encourage full liberalisation, which we have achieved now in the United Kingdom. The benefits of this are self-evident. More competition leads to more frequencies and better services at more competitive prices. That is good for the consumer and good for the industry, as well as being good for the country as whole.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para51"></a>As a result of our competition policy, our airlines are in an excellent position to take advantage of the opportunities offered in Europe by the single market and elsewhere in the world. We have a relatively large number of airlines in this country&#151;a rather surprising figure of around 50&#151;all of which operate in the private sector, none of which receives state subsidy and most of which operate international, scheduled or chartered passenger services. That has been achieved without sacrificing our commitment to ensuring that the highest standards of safety and security are maintained.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para52"></a>I also believe that the environmental considerations raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, are extremely important, but I do not believe that our aims of liberalisation conflict with our policies of minimising the environmental consequences of transport. I should mention also that the noble Baroness sprayed a fair number of questions at me in the course of her remarks, most of which concern the very real issues which surround this subject. I hope that at the end of my remarks she will be satisfied that I have addressed the key issues which she indicated.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para53"></a>Progress towards liberalisation of the international air transport market has been most notable within the European Community. The Third Aviation Package, <P>


<a name="column_1853"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1853</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which came into effect on 1st January 1993, introduces uniform criteria for operator licensing and removes restrictions on cross-border investment. Member states are no longer able to favour national flag carriers in issuing route licences and access to routes within the Community and subsequently throughout the European economic area, which has also been opened up.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para54"></a>The third package also ensures that carriers are now free to set fares according to their commercial judgment. That subject was developed by my noble friend Lord Bethell, who went on to point out that, although fares might not be regulated, it is up the commercial airline concerned to set the fare which it considers appropriate. That series of measures has resulted in reduced fares on a number of key EEA routes, including London to Paris and London to Amsterdam. My noble friend gave us some helpful examples of the movement in fare levels on the London to Paris route. The only remaining restrictions, which relate to the provision of domestic cabotage within other member states, will be removed in April 1997.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para55"></a>The rules now applying in Europe established the framework within which we and other member states are required to operate. It is, however, equally essential that all member states follow the rules and that the Commission is prepared to act to enforce them wherever necessary so that the benefits of that liberal framework are fully realised. That is why we have fought so long and hard to secure access for our carriers to Orly airport in Paris. I am pleased to say that a number of UK airlines have now successfully established services on the London-Orly route, opening up a new route for air passengers, who can now choose between two airports in Paris rather than being obliged to fly into Charles de Gaulle.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para56"></a>It is clear that there is still plenty more to do. For instance, it is essential that ground handling should no longer be operated on a monopoly basis, as is the case at many European airports. We have therefore welcomed the Commission's proposals for a framework directive and hope that negotiations on this matter can be completed as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para57"></a>My noble friend Lord Brabazon referred to a black cloud in the rosy picture. That black cloud was the issue of state aid. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain and a number of other noble Lords concentrated on the difficulties and inequalities which the high levels of state aid have meant. It is now particularly important that the Commission grasps the nettle of state aid to national airlines. State aid is one of the most serious impediments to realising the full benefits of the single market. It removes the incentive for state-owned airlines to become efficient and consequently results in a bad deal for passengers. UK airlines have had to face the pain of restructuring without state help but still have to compete with inefficient airlines supported by state subsidies.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para58"></a>Despite that, the Commission has so far approved the six applications it has received from member states since 1991 for restructuring aid for their ailing flag carriers. This amounts to approval of &#163;5.3 billion of state aid which has been allowed to distort competition within the single market, nearly half of which went to one airline, Air France. This is our reason for challenging the <P>


<a name="column_1854"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commission's decision to allow &#163;2.4 billion of state aid to Air France. We are also giving our full backing to the legal challenge made by a number of European airlines, including British Airways, British Midland and Air UK. I can advise my noble friend Lord Brabazon, who asked about the state of play with regard to those challenges, that the Government's case has been stayed pending the outcome of the airlines' cases, which we understand may begin later this year.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para59"></a>A further test for the Commission's policy will be the Spanish Government's second application for state aid for Iberia. It was a key condition of Iberia's previous state aid injection, which the Commission approved in 1992, that the airlines should receive no more aid during the current restructuring period. It is essential that the Commission upholds its earlier decision. I cannot emphasise too strongly that failure to tackle the issue of state aid continues to threaten the single market in air transport and calls into question the Commission's ambitions to negotiate external air services agreements.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para60"></a>The UK has an excellent record of negotiating liberal arrangements with states outside the Community and in recent years has successfully negotiated more liberal arrangements with, among others, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore and a number of central and eastern European states.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para61"></a>That brings me to the issue of competence, to which the noble Lord, Lord Desai, addressed himself. It was investigated also by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. Under Community law, as the European Court of Justice confirmed in its Opinion on the GATT agreement last year, competence for external relations in transport is shared between the Community and member states. Therefore, member states remain free to negotiate air service agreements with third countries, provided that their negotiations will not affect the Community rules or alter their scope.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para62"></a>There are some circumstances where the European Commission may legitimately negotiate air service agreements with third countries on behalf of the Community, but it may do so only on the basis of a mandate which has been approved by the Council of Ministers. Indeed, there are such circumstances in which the UK has supported and continues to support Community level negotiations; for example, in extending the second and third air transport packages to Norway and Sweden, and more recently in agreeing a mandate for Community negotiations to extend the benefits of the third package to Switzerland. Such Community-level negotiations are legitimate because they involve other European countries adopting internal EC rules. The negotiations with Switzerland are now under way.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para63"></a>However, in other areas, most notably with regard to the United States of America, we are not convinced that Community negotiations would be in the best interests of member states; nor that they would achieve a better result for our airlines and passengers than continuing negotiations at national level. The Commission has recently proposed a draft mandate for negotiations with the US. However, this is little more than a wish list and lacks a thorough analysis of the potential advantages and disadvantages for the European Community and its industry, consumers and regions. It fails to address the key <P>


<a name="column_1855"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question of whether negotiations on this basis could realistically&#151;that is the key word in the entire debate&#151;achieve a better result. In the absence of that analysis, we do not believe that the mandate can provide an adequate basis for further discussion.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para64"></a>Also, on a practical level it would be extremely difficult to secure agreement on a mandate for negotiations with the US which would reflect the divergent interests of the 15 member states, their airlines and regional interests. It is important to put that into context when considering the practical difficulties. It took nearly two years for the member states to agree a mandate for Community-level negotiations with Switzerland which was based almost entirely on extending existing Community legislation on the single market in air transport to Switzerland and where the practical and economic complexities are not nearly as great as those relating to the United States.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para65"></a>From our considerable experience of such highly complex bilateral negotiations, it is clear that it is not an easy matter to reconcile the often conflicting interests of the individual airlines involved, the consumer interest and the interests of regional airports. At Community level, the difficulties would be multiplied many times over. It is also clear that there is little consensus among the member states on the policy to be adopted on air transport relations with the United States&#151;whether protectionist or seeking liberalisation. For the Commission to secure a mandate which satisfies those members who favour a fully liberal agreement and those who advocate a more protectionist stance must be unrealistic. And, unlike the creation of the single market within Europe, there is no treaty obligation which obliges member states to liberalise air services relations with the US.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para66"></a>The European Commission has now announced its intention to pursue action against the six member states which have initialled so-called "open-skies" agreements with the United States. The Commission also wrote to the UK about our bilateral negotiations with the United States. I firmly believe that it is in our best interests that we continue to negotiate air service agreements bilaterally with the US. We have the necessary powers to do so and nothing in our on-going negotiations with the US conflicts in any way with our obligations under the Treaty of Rome.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para67"></a>The North American market is the biggest long haul market from Europe, with some 30 million passengers each year. It is especially important for the UK, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent. of the total traffic&#151;ahead of both Germany (with 18 per cent.) and France (12 per cent.). It is extremely important in commercial terms for UK airlines.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para68"></a>We have heard expressed this evening that BA feels that last year routes to the Americas contributed some 40 per cent. to its operating profits. In any case, we believe that national governments are best placed to identify what is in the interests of industry and consumers, to identify a strategy and realistically to carry out the negotiations. The Commission has failed to produce any evidence to suggest that that is not the case. The Government will therefore continue to resist the Commission's claims to exclusive competence in this area and its attempts to take over responsibility from the member states.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50614-06_para69"></a>I believe that the Government are in the best position to negotiate our air service agreements with the US. As we have heard, as recently as 5th June we signed an agreement with the US which provides new opportunities for both the UK and US airlines. The deal allows BA to offer more services from Heathrow to Philadelphia, and allows UK airlines the opportunity to carry some US government traffic, which until now has not been open to UK airlines. Those are the so-called "fly American" provisions. It also moves further towards liberalising code-sharing arrangements between the UK and the US, as well as allowing a second US airline on the Chicago-Heathrow route.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para70"></a>We have also swept away many obstacles to the ability of both countries to benefit from the unilateral offer which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made in October last year to open up transatlantic services to all UK regional airports, including Stansted and Luton. That should result in an increase in transatlantic services, and we have recently seen a new service on the Birmingham-Chicago route.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para71"></a>The process of liberalisation must not stop here. Work will start on the next stage of negotiations with the aim of opening up further opportunities for transatlantic traffic very soon.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para72"></a>The agreement signed on 5th June will ensure that passengers will be able to benefit from a greater frequency of transatlantic service and wider choice, bringing with it the prospect of more competitive fares. We have not abandoned the goal of wider liberalisation with the United States, but in view of the difficulties which noble Lords have highlighted during the course of the debate we feel that it is best to proceed on an incremental basis by focusing on specific issues and by trying to secure a balanced agreement which can be built upon and which meets the needs of our airlines and passengers.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para73"></a>In conclusion, therefore, I believe it remains in the UK's interests to negotiate bilaterally with the US. A significant proportion of transatlantic traffic (as we have heard, some 40 per cent.) is accounted for by the UK. We have a strong negotiating position, and I firmly believe that it is within our rights to continue such negotiations with the goal of achieving further liberalisation.

<A NAME="50614-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. I hope noble Lords found it interesting. It has been well informed. It may not have had many speakers but all those who spoke did so with a great knowledge of the subject. I should like to thank especially my noble friend the Minister for the care and attention that he gave to his reply.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para74"></a>We have had a degree of unanimity&#151;it is rare in this House for it to be so strong&#151;on the issue of state subsidies. I hope that Commissioner Kinnock, if he has an opportunity, will be able to read the debate. I doubt if he will. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, might use his good offices as a former Commissioner and as a colleague in the Labour Party to draw it to his attention. If he manages to resist the calls for state subsidy, he will at least know that he has the wholehearted support of the House of Lords, for what that is worth.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50614-06_para75"></a>On the other issue which was the subject of the debate&#151;negotiations with the United States&#151;slightly more balanced views were expressed. I said that I did not rule out for ever the possibility of that happening. The approach of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, was similar. He might like to get there a bit quicker than I would, but nevertheless there was a certain degree of agreement within the House. As I said, I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister for having given such a detailed response on that point.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para76"></a>A number of other issues were raised. It is not the custom for me to answer in detail, much as I might like to. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, made the point that I was in favour of cabotage within Europe, which I am, and that is part of the third package. She asked why I find it difficult to accept that another European airline might be given a right to the US in exchange for an American airline being given a right to London. Those two things at the moment&#151;I say "at the moment"&#151;are different issues. There might be a case for that one day, but not right now.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para77"></a>The noble Baroness also mentioned the environment. My noble friend the Minister made the point that I would have made. I do not consider liberalisation, in itself, poses a threat to the environment in any way. Air travel, whatever the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection might like, is, by all forecasts, set to grow, and to keep on growing. While I agree entirely with the noble Baroness that we would like to see more cross-Channel traffic through the tunnel, I believe&#151;I may be wrong&#151;that the last figures I recall hearing were that the total capacity for passenger trains through the tunnel accounts for about one year's anticipated growth in air travel. So I am afraid that it will not make an enormous impact.
<P>

<a name="50614-06_para78"></a>I should like again to thank all those noble Lords who took part in the debate, and I beg leave to withdraw my Motion for Papers.

<A NAME="50614-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Houghton of Sowerby: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a third time.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para0"></a>It is just about four years since the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 passed through all its stages in the other place in one Sitting, in the space of eight hours. It received its Third Reading at three o'clock in the morning.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para1"></a>As we go into the fifth year of the operation of that Act, I hope that we are getting nearer to taking seriously the proposals that are being made in different quarters for changes to the drastic and hostile regime which the 1991 Act imposed on a lot of innocent citizens and innocent dogs and which caused anguish beyond measure, something which many people will never forget.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para2"></a>I shall not make a long and emotional speech. However, I shall persevere and I hope to be able to reintroduce the Bill in the next Session. I am hopeful of persuading your Lordships' House to set up a Select Committee to examine the working of the 1991 Act over four full years. It is astonishing that, in respect of a Bill which went <P>


<a name="column_1858"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1858</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through the House of Commons under a guillotine and which was unprecedented in peacetime for its brevity and its discipline, there is so little information about the conditions which it has created.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para3"></a>Information has been hard to come by. Statistics are always a year in arrears. The police have adopted a phraseology for court proceedings which is not easy to translate into actual events. For example, I do not believe that anyone studying the statistics is able to say how many pit bull terriers were slaughtered under the mandatory destruction order provided for in Section 1 of the Act. We do not know what progress has been made in any direction as regards either the accomplishment or the completion of a task set for attention in the interests of the public.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para4"></a>That omission needs to be made good. We want to know more about what has happened over the past four years. Government departments and the police should assist the Select Committee of your Lordships' House, if it is set up, to discover more about what has happened. I have made my application to the Liaison Committee, which, under our new procedure, examines applications for the reference of Bills to Select Committees and makes recommendations. I await its verdict on my application. If it is looked upon favourably, I hope that the Select Committee will start work later this year.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para5"></a>Sometimes I feel sorry for Ministers. They have a thankless task to carry out because frequently they must speak with a voice which may not be their own. In the interests of the unity of the Government and the co-ordination of policy they have to follow instructions. I sympathise with them when they must do a job which is not wholly to their taste. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, for attending the later debates on the Bill and I know how much personal attention she has given to the matter. I understand that later this month she will receive a delegation from the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act Reform Group. In my absence, its members will tell her what they feel about the situation. That delegation will be led by the president of the British Veterinary Association and distinguished members of the animal welfare world will give personal testimony of their experiences. I shall say no more about that.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para6"></a>As a precautionary measure, and without intending to pre-empt the consideration of my application by the Liaison Committee, I shall tell some people and some organisations to be ready to be called upon to give evidence to a Select Committee in order that it may have a short duration and come out sharply with reactions to the matter that it has inquired into.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para7"></a>I thank those who have supported me in the preparation of the Bill and who have been present during debates in your Lordships' House. I told my friends that I should be ready to stand alone and would forgive them if they kept engagements which they thought would be more rewarding than coming here again to listen to me. If they are not here in person, they are here in thought and I discharge my duty to them with grateful thanks.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para8"></a>One meets some very pleasant people from all parties who share one's views on particular matters in society, in life and in the world. It is a pleasure to meet such people. Politics can be a very narrow cabin in which to live, in particular if one listens only to those around one who agree with what one says. However, the Conservative <P>


<a name="column_1859"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Party is fortunately placed because it has a variety of voices which must be listened to. That makes life more interesting and exciting and it makes political life more dangerous.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para9"></a>On the Labour Benches we have only a single chorus in which everybody joins. We keep on listening to it and I shall not repeat the phrase. But it is not as interesting as it used to be. Recently I have been studying the life and work of Harold Wilson and what little part I played in it. That was the time for the reality of politics. I recall the vituperation to which I have listened in the course of party conflict and I realise that today things are very dull in the Labour Party. However, its time may come. It will be a very rough passage for any government who in present circumstances take over the reins of responsibility. The world is not only a changing place but something of a frightening place too. Why I want to go on living in it I do not know&#151;but I do.

<P>

<A NAME="50614-07_spnew1"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Houghton of Sowerby: </B>   My Lords, I conclude by saying that whatever we feel about the part of the Dangerous Dogs Act which refers to pit bull terriers, we must clear up the present duality of the treatment of other breeds of dog which are convicted under Section 3. It is extraordinarily difficult for the police and the courts to decide why a particular case comes forward with a charge under the 1871 Act and another case comes forward with a charge under the 1991 Act. Why the difference and who makes the choice? Of course the consequence is important because a conviction under the 1991 Act is followed by a mandatory destruction order. No questions are asked and no pleas are listened to by the Bench, which is struck dumb by the 1991 Act. Alternatively, the charge is brought under the 1871 Act, where a mandatory destruction order is no part of the provisions of the Act. That split position for dogs charged with being out of control and injuring persons certainly needs speedy attention.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para10"></a>I said that I was not going to speak for long. I have not been contentious. I am feeling very grateful for the attention that has been given to this matter. I am not downhearted. I feel fit enough to go on and I shall return to your Lordships later in the year. In the meantime, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a third time.

<P>

<a name="50614-07_para12"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for writing to me and giving me such information as she has. But I think she will agree that that is not sufficient for us to draw a firm conclusion. I support my noble friend in his efforts to obtain more information and to have it considered in a more rational way by the House.

<a name="50614-07_para13"></a>I do not know how many of your Lordships are members of the Wine Society. In the Wine Society, tables of fitness of vintages move from "ready soon" to "drinking well" to "showing age". My noble friend is drinking well. Long may he continue to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, your Lordships will recall that during Second Reading of this Bill I set out the Government's reservations about the purposes of the Bill and the reasons why we felt unable to give it our support. I acknowledged the consistency with which the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, had opposed this legislation, and indeed all your Lordships will be well aware of the genuine concern he feels on these matters.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para14"></a>I hope that I shall not sound patronising if I say that I stand in admiration of the contribution which the noble Lord makes to matters in this House. I am deeply sorry that I cannot accede to his impassioned plea on this occasion, because I know that this matter is felt very deeply in the mind of the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para15"></a>But, as he knows, this Government have been equally consistent in their view that there is no place in our society for fighting dogs; that the 1991 Act was needed to deal with a real and pressing public concern; and that anything which reduces the tough incentives contained in the Act would amount to a weakening of the protection which the Act affords. That, as your Lordships know, is a risk which we cannot take.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para16"></a>I do know that that was a disappointment to the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, and I have to say to him&#151;I do not think it will come as a surprise&#151;that nothing that has occurred since we last debated the matter causes the Government to change their view. We simply cannot take chances with the safety of the public and, in particular, with the safety of children. Only today in my post, I received information about a dog attack on a person.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para17"></a>In our view, the mandatory destruction order and the one-off nature of the registration scheme are both integral to the provisions of the Act and to the objectives that Parliament agreed. In the course of the Second Reading debate, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, asked for statistics about the practical workings of the Dangerous Dogs Act. As he has recognised, I wrote to the noble Lord on 20th March with the data that were available, and I copied my letter to all noble Lords who spoke in the debate, and placed a copy in the Library. I note the noble Lord's comments at Committee stage on the value of the information, and I hope that others of your Lordships found the information useful as well.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para18"></a>However, I take the point made by the noble Lords, Lord McIntosh of Haringey and Lord Houghton of Sowerby. We should continue to press for better information about this matter. I understand that information is now being collated rather differently and more efficiently. I shall bring whatever information I can as speedily as possible to the House.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, invited the Government to try to persuade enforcement bodies to proceed under legislation other than the 1991 Act; for example, the Dogs Act 1871. I can tell the noble Baroness, although I see that she is not in her place, that we hope shortly to be issuing guidance to practitioners on the <P>


<a name="column_1861"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1861</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considerations which may determine which statute is the most appropriate in any given situation. We have offered some advice on this issue before, but we agree it might be helpful to strengthen the message. Your Lordships will appreciate that there are limits to what we can say, without trespassing upon the discretion of the prosecuting authorities. But I hope that the issue of the guidance will prove a helpful further contribution to the fair operation of the Act.
<P>

<a name="50614-07_para20"></a>In our view, the provisions of the Bill run counter to the Government's absolute responsibility to protect the public from dog attacks. But, since this is a Private Member's Bill, as is the convention of the House, I shall not, of course, oppose the Third Reading of the Bill.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50614-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Since the Second Reading was moved, British Red Cross representatives have met with officials from relevant government departments. Their meetings have been constructive and amendments to the Bill have been agreed. Although there are a large number of amendments to the original Bill, they are largely technical in nature. The result is the limitation of legislation to what is essential to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the two 1977 protocols additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions; and to bring up to date certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957.
<P>

<a name="50614-08_para7"></a>The Committee will remember that the enactment of the necessary changes to British law to enable ratification of the protocols was always the primary object of the Bill, and the amendments to be put before the Committee do not detract from that central purpose.
<P>

<a name="50614-08_para8"></a>Moreover, many of the intended effects of the original Bill are improved by the amendments which the British Red Cross is happy to support. I am particularly grateful to the Home Office and the Minister and other officials who have worked long and hard to achieve that objective, together with my Red Cross colleagues. With the permission of the Committee, I shall name three of them who have worked so hard in the 150th year of the Red Cross to see that the Bill reaches the statute book before they go to the major convention in Geneva in December. I thank them personally. They are Sir Alan Munro, Mr. David Wyatt and Mr. Michael Meyer.
<P>

<a name="50614-08_para9"></a>The Bill, as now amended, is fully endorsed by the British Red Cross, as the prime mover in bringing this Bill before your Lordships' House, and is also fully endorsed by Her Majesty's Government. It represents a careful and thorough package which the Committee is asked to accept as such. It is of course for the Committee to decide whether to approve the Bill as now amended. But I have to say that if changes are sought, it could lead to the whole exercise unravelling, and would then leave insufficient time for the protocols to be ratified before the crucial conference of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent in December, when it will be in the interest of this country to be able to announce at that time that the ratification process is complete.
<P>

<a name="50614-08_para10"></a>I also wish to explain to your Lordships that when the Bill was originally published there were a number of printing errors&#151;I repeat, printing errors&#151;as helpfully drawn to our attention by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in the Second Reading debate. Most of these printing errors pertain to the schedules to the Bill, which are simply reprints of existing treaty texts, and not to the Bill itself. However, I am able to assure your Lordships that the Public Bill Office will reprint the Bill before the Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50614-08_para11"></a>With the permission of the Committee, I shall now move to Amendment No. 1 and also speak to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3. Although these amendments may appear substantial and perhaps a little cumbersome, they do not significantly alter the substance of the original provisions of the Bill, at least in terms of the effect they will have in amending the Geneva <P>


<a name="column_1863"></a>

<B>14 Jun 1995 : Column 1863</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Conventions Act 1957. Perhaps the most substantial difference between the original draft of the Bill and the amended version of Clause 1 is that the proposed new subsection (1B) has been dropped. This provided that reprisal could not be relied upon as defence. But the United Kingdom wishes to retain the right to take reprisals in certain closely defined circumstances. The Government intend to enter a reservation to this effect on ratification of the protocols. The proposed new Section 1(1B) would have been incompatible with this and has not therefore been retained in the amended Clause 1. The other slight changes that have been made will, as I have said, simply update and tidy the provisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I rise not to consider the amendments in detail. I understand and appreciate that they have been discussed between the Red Cross and the Home Office and I am satisfied with that. I shall not pursue the matters in detail. However, I want to reaffirm what I said at Second Reading and what the noble Lord, Lord Archer, has repeated today. The most urgent thing is to get the Bill through. At Second Reading I undertook to consult my honourable friends in another place about that. I am happy to confirm that, having made those consultations, both the Labour Front Bench and the Labour Whips Office will do everything in their power to see that the Bill progresses in another place without delay. I am advised that, provided the Bill is presented there not later than 14th July&#151;I would hope that it could be earlier than that&#151;there is no reason why it should not proceed through all its stages in a single day. Incidentally, I understand that my honourable friend Mark Fisher knows nothing of the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Archer, has made arrangements for a Member of the House of Commons to present it there.

I simply want to put on record from the Government Benches that I am enormously grateful for the collaborative work between Red Cross officials and my own officials in the Home Office and also to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and all those who spoke at Second Reading who are coming together&#151;I shall not say uniquely, but it is heartening to think that all parties are coming together, which I hope will be repeated in another place&#151;to give the Bill the smoothest possible passage. If I may beg the indulgence of the Committee, I would suggest that we do not address the details of the amendments but give them the swiftest possible passage through the Committee so that the Bill can make its way to another place for an equally smooth passage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My intention in proposing the criminalisation of certain breaches of the first protocol was to ensure that those contraventions not deemed "grave breaches" but nevertheless of sufficient seriousness should be treated like grave breaches. However, it has been brought to my attention that the sort of misconduct which would constitute a breach of the first protocol is in many cases already covered by the existing criminal law and by the Armed Forces disciplinary codes.
<P>

<a name="50614-09_para0"></a>The United Kingdom views any breach of the Geneva Conventions with the utmost seriousness and I am confident that any contravention of the additional protocols will be properly dealt with by the due process of law. Moreover, elevation of certain contraventions of the first protocol to "grave breach" status would, in some circumstances, risk imposing severe penalties on relatively minor offences. This clause is not required to enable ratification of the protocols and I therefore oppose the Question that it should stand part of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50614-09_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 5 to 12. The amendments to Clause 3, like those to Clause 1, do not significantly alter the substance of the original provisions of the Bill. To keep the formulation of the Bill in line with current legislative practice, Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 confer protecting authority for use of the Red Cross and other emblems and their imitations on the Secretary of State. Arrangements resulting from the legislation will of course clarify where responsibility for the various emblems will lie. Although the provision of any regulation-making power for the Secretary of State in connection with the use of emblems and designations is removed from this clause, subsequent amendment to Clause 4 makes the necessary provision.
<P>

<a name="50614-09_para4"></a>As in the original Clause 3 of the Bill, provision has also been made, through Amendment No. 4, for the addition to the list of protected emblems and designations of the international civil defence sign and the distinctive signals of identification for medical units and transports. Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 also ensure that all provisions in the 1957 Act which relate to the use of protected emblems and designations, including the forfeiture provision in relation to misuse of such emblems and designations on goods and other articles, are also extended to these signs and signals. However, in line with the current provisions of the 1957 Act, a defence is provided for use of trade marks, other designs and wording resembling these signs and signals, if they have been in use before the passage of this Bill. The opportunity has also been taken to update other subsections of Section 6. The remaining amendments to this clause are merely minor drafting changes. I beg to move.

At the outbreak of hostilities, they shall transmit to each other a specimen of the model they are using, if such model differs from that shown in Figure 1. The identity card shall be made out, if possible, in duplicate, one copy being kept by the issuing authority, which should maintain control of the cards which it has issued.

3. Medical vehicles should exhibit one or more flashing blue lights visible from as far away as possible. The High Contracting Parties and, in particular, the Parties to the conflict which use lights of other colours should give notification of this.
<br>
4. The recommended blue colour is obtained when its chromaticity is within the boundaries of the International Commission on Illumination (ICI) chromaticity diagram defined by the following equations:
<br>
 green boundary y = 0.065 + 0.805 x;
<br>
 white boundary y = 0.400 - x;
<br>
 purple boundary x = 0.133 + 0.600 y.
<br>
The recommended flashing rate of the blue light is between sixty and one hundred flashes per minute.
<center><b>Article 8 - Radio signal</B></center><br>
1. The radio signal shall consist of the urgency signal and the distinctive signal as described in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR Articles 40 and N 40).
<br>
2. The radio message preceded by the urgency and distinctive signals mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be transmitted in English at appropriate intervals on a frequency or frequencies specified for this purpose in the Radio Regulations, and shall convey the following data relating to the medical transports concerned:
<br>
(a) call sign or other recognised means of identification;
<br>
(b) position;
<br>
(c) number and type of vehicles;
<br>
(d) intended route;
<br>
(e) estimated time en route and of departure and arrival, as appropriate;
<br>
(f) any other information, such as flight altitude, guarded radio frequencies, languages used and secondary surveillance radar modes and codes.
<br>
3. In order to facilitate the communications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, as well as the communications referred to in Articles 22, 23 and 25 to 31 of the Protocol, the High Contracting Parties, the Parties to a conflict, or one of the Parties to a conflict, acting in agreement or alone, may designate, in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations in the Radio Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention, and publish selected national frequencies to be used by them for such communications. The International Telecommunication Union shall be notified of these frequencies in accordance with procedures approved by a World Administrative Radio Conference.
<center><b>Article 9 - Electronic identification</B></center><br>
1. The Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) system, as specified in Annex 10 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944, as amended from time to time, may be used to identify and to follow the course of medical aircraft. The SSR mode and code to be reserved for the exclusive use of medical aircraft shall be established by the High Contracting Parties, the Parties to a conflict, or one of the Parties to a conflict, acting in agreement or alone, in accordance with procedures to be recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
<br>
2. Protected medical transports may, for their identification and location, use standard aeronautical radar transponders and/or maritime search and rescue radar transponders.
<br>
It should be possible for protected medical transports to be identified by other vessels or aircraft equipped with secondary surveillance radar by means of a code transmitted by a radar transponder, e.g. in mode 3/A, fitted on the medical transports.
<br>
The code transmitted by the medical transport transponder should be assigned to that transport by the competent authorities and notified to all the Parties to the conflict.
<br>
3. It should be possible for medical transports to be identified by submarines by the appropriate underwater acoustic signals transmitted by the medical transports.
<br>
The underwater acoustic signal shall consist of the call sign (or any other recognised means of identification of medical transport) of the ship preceded by the single group YYY transmitted in morse on an appropriate acoustic frequency, e.g. 5kHz.
<br>
Parties to a conflict wishing to use the underwater acoustic identification signal described above shall inform the Parties concerned of the signal as soon as possible, and shall, when notifying the use of their hospital ships, confirm the frequency to be employed.
<br>
4. Parties to a conflict may, by special agreement between them, establish for their use a similar electronic system for the identification of medical vehicles, and medical ships and craft.
<center><b>CHAPTER IV - COMMUNICATIONS</B></center><center><b>Article 10 - Radiocommunications</B></center><br>
1. The urgency signal and the distinctive signal provided for in Article 8 may precede appropriate radiocommunications by medical units and transports in the application of the procedures carried out under Articles 22, 23 and 25 to 31 of the Protocol.
<br>
2. The medical transports referred to in Articles 40 (Section II, No. 3209) and N 40 (Section III, No. 3214) of the ITU Radio Regulations may also transmit their communications by satellite systems, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 37, N 37 and 59 of the ITU Radio Regulations for the Mobile-Satellite Services.
<center><b>Article 11 - Use of international codes</B></center><br>

<a name="50614-10_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: Despite the considerable length of these amendments the Committee will be pleased to hear that they are, fortunately, straightforward, and that I will be able to deal with them briefly. The first two stem from the fact that a revised version of Annex I to Protocol I was brought into force on 1st March last year, but the text of the annex that is currently reproduced in the schedule to the Bill is that of a previous, and consequently out-of-date, version. Amendment No. 24 therefore deletes this obsolete text and inserts the current version of Annex I into the schedule. Amendment No. 23 is consequential and makes the necessary change where Article 56 of the protocol itself, as it currently appears in the schedule, refers to "Article 16" of the annex, whereas it should, in view of the revised version, make reference to "Article 17". Amendment No. 25 is similar to No. 21 in that it simply deletes text and makes provision for a pictorial representation to appear on the face of the Bill in its place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_wqn0"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many otherwise homeless people are at present in bed and breakfast accommodation
(a) through local authority placement; and
(b) through self-placement.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  The latest figures show that 4,330 households accepted as statutorily homeless by English local authorities were in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation on 31 December 1994. Information about the number of people who have placed themselves in bed and breakfast accommodation is not held centrally.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_wqn1"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are satisfied with the general standard of cooking facilities in bed and breakfast accommodation for the homeless.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Local authorities must, by law, have regard to the Homelessness Code of Guidance issued by the Secretary of State, which advises that bed and breakfast hotels used as temporary accommodation must conform to the regulations on standards for houses in multiple occupation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_wqn2"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What legal controls there are over service charges in bed and breakfast accommodation for the homeless.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   There are no legal controls over charges which landlords can make for bed and breakfast accommodation, but there are limits on the amount of housing benefit payable to claimants in such accommodation. Housing benefit is generally only payable in relation to accommodation-related services.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_wqn3"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will consider a licensing system for bed and breakfast accommodation for the homeless.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Most bed and breakfast hotels fall within the statutory definition of a house in multiple occupation. Following a recent consultation exercise, the Government are considering whether to introduce a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_wqn4"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have any information on the average length of stay in bed and breakfast accommodation for the homeless, and on the destinations of those who leave it.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Preliminary findings from a research evaluation of the 1991 Homelessness Code of Guidance indicate that, in those local authorities reporting use of bed and breakfast hotels as temporary <P>

<A NAME="50614w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What performance targets the Secretary of State for the Environment has set the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre Executive Agency for 1995/96.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   The agency's principal target for 1995/96 is to achieve a net surplus of &#163;3,000. Following several years of progressive reduction in the centre's operating deficit, it is possible this year for the first time to target a surplus. This is exclusive of rent of &#163;6.4 million.
<P>

<a name="50614w01_para0"></a>The agency's other key targets are:
(a) to increase total revenue from &#163;5.5 million to &#163;5.8 million;
(b) to reduce debt outstanding from clients for over 60 days to no more than &#163;154,000.

<A NAME="50614w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Brussels on 29 and 30 May.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50614w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  This meeting of the Council, at which my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food represented the United Kingdom, concentrated mainly on a proposal from the Commission for changes to the agri-monetary arrangements and on rules for the welfare of animals in transport.
<P>

<a name="50614w01_para2"></a>No decisions were reached. The Council will return to both subjects at its next meeting on 19 and 20 June, when it will also aim to decide farm prices and related measures for 1995&#150;96.
<P>

<a name="50614w01_para3"></a>The Commission's proposal on agri-money would reduce the cost and scope of the compensatory measures accompanying any green rate revaluation that took place in 1995. It is the present rules on compensation which have led the Council and Commission to delay green rate revaluations that should have taken place, resulting in distortion of trade and excessive levels of support in the Community as a whole. My right honourable friend strongly supported the Commission's proposal. The German Minister, with some support from others, suggested alternative changes that would lead to permanent differences in payments to farmers in <P>


<a name="column_WA117"></a>

</P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different member states. My right honourable friend made clear that this would be wholly unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="50614w01_para4"></a>The discussion on animal transport showed that member states are broadly agreed on the main lines of
new arrangements, but still differ on the key questions of maximum journey times and the length of breaks between journeys. My right honourable friend welcomed the assurance from the French Presidency that they give high priority to this issue, and urged all parties to make great efforts to reach an agreement in June.
<P>

<a name="50614w01_para5"></a>The Council formally adopted by majority vote, with Germany and Netherlands opposing, the measures necessary to implement the compromise decision on Italian, Spanish and Greek milk quotas, reached at the October meeting of the Economic and Finance Council. It also adopted unanimously a proposal fixing support prices for certain fruits and vegetables for June 1995.
