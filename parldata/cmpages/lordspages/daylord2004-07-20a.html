<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Boothroyd </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What guidelines are being given to general practitioners to check the eligibility of overseas visitors to receive medical care.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, existing guidance to general practice on these matters is set out in health service circular 1999/18. That makes it clear that if GPs do not wish to accept overseas visitors as NHS patients, they can offer to treat them on a private paying basis. The Government are currently consulting on proposals to clarify the rules in this area. Revised guidance will be issued to explain any changes that are made to the rules after the consultation ends on 13 August.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Boothroyd: </b>   My Lords, I am delighted to hear of the consultation process, although I am sad to say that the GPs with whom I have spoken are not aware of it. Is the Minister aware of the claim made by GPs at their recent conference that one in 10 patients is not entitled to NHS care? Does he agree that general practitioners are the gatekeepers of the NHS, without the time or the resources to ascertain the eligibility of visiting tourists?
</p>

<a name="40720-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Would he consider that until such time as we are issued with identity cards, we insist on holiday insurance that covers healthcare for every overseas visitor who does not fall within the eligibility rules? Would that not have the two-pronged effect of reducing pressure on our health service and at the same <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_88"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time lessening the need to recruit professional health personnel from overseas countries whose need is often greater than our own?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there are a number of strands to the noble Baroness&#039;s questions. As regards the suggestion that one in 10 patients on GPs&#039; lists are not entitled to NHS care, it was in fact one general practitioner at the BMA conference who said that, who happens to be based in Gants Hill, Essex. We have no reliable data on the number of overseas visitors registered with general practices but, as I said, it is open to doctors now, under the current guidance, not to accept people where they have good reason to believe that they do not live in their practice area and to deal with them on a private, fee-paying basis.
</p>

<a name="40720-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Given that we have started a process of consultation, it would be premature to pre-empt that consultation by deciding how we are going to tackle this problem. Out of that consultation will come further guidance for general practice to bring it more in line with the guidance that has now been reissued to hospital services. Under the new system, essentially, the burden of proof will be on the person presenting himself or herself for registration to declare and demonstrate unambiguously that they are eligible for free NHS primary medical services.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend enlarge on what seems to me to be a fantasy land? Most of us when we try to visit our general practitioner get to see a receptionist, who then quotes a date a month or five weeks ahead when we might be fitted in. I know that all these overseas visitors are diabolically clever, but how do they manage in their short visits to get to see a GP at all?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I know how fit my noble friend is; he may not have been to his GP lately and may not have noticed that we have speeded up access to general practitioners. It is one of the many achievements within the NHS that is to the Government&#039;s credit. Of course, when the new arrangements come in&#151;we are not reorganising general practice&#151;it will be for patients to present themselves and, as I said earlier, to convince the practice that they are eligible for free NHS care.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </b>   My Lords, when answering the first Question the Minister told the House that the Government do not know the size of the burden placed on GPs at present. Is it not rather important to know that before you start instructing GPs how to handle what might be quite a minor problem? If further guidance is issued, is it not important to ensure that it does not result in an additional administrative burden upon GPs, who are already extremely overburdened with administration? Finally, is there not a risk that persons of ethnic minorities who live in our country might constantly be checked for eligibility?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the work done by GPs. As the House knows, the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_89"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 89</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have increased the number of general practitioners so that the burden is more evenly spread. We are conducting a survey to ascertain whether there is a problem in this area. It is important that we amend the guidance because it contains some ambiguities. It is important that the guidance on free NHS primary care is aligned with the new guidance on the entitlement of overseas visitors to hospital services.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many people with HIV come from abroad, develop AIDS and stay on? Will GPs be given extra funds to cope with these people?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I would suggest that that is a little wide of the scope of the Question. As the noble Baroness may know, the Cabinet Office is currently reviewing imported infections and immigration into the UK. We await the result of that review, which will be made available publicly in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that today he has announced another survey and reported to us on further consultation? Can he tell the House the state of play of the consultation that is already taking place in relation to entitlement cards, which was announced with a great flourish some months ago? If we had entitlement cards, would not that relieve general practitioners of any kind of administrative burden being put upon them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the Government are still working in this particular area. Although, again, it is a little wide of the scope of the Question, I shall make further inquiries and write to my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that short-term visitors to the UK who are taken ill during a holiday or a short-term visit are entitled under the law to free treatment, both by general practitioners and in hospital; but that people coming here specifically for medical treatment and investigation at hospitals must be private patients? To avoid any kind of misunderstanding, can the Minister clarify the position of overseas students from outside the European Community and their entitlement to medical care in the UK?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is true that the NHS remains a humanitarian service and that treatment will be provided free of charge where, in the professional opinion of a healthcare clinician, it is an emergency or immediately necessary. Nothing in the consultations will change that. As I said earlier, the arrangements in relation to primary care will be brought into alignment with the new hospital charging regulations, which came into operation in England on 1 April. We want to ensure that the same conditions apply. Essentially, they will require people to be ordinarily resident in this country. There will be a number of exemptions, and I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_90"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 90</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

believe that students will form a part of those exemptions. I shall confirm that in writing to the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew12"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, what is the scale of the problem that the Government are seeking to solve?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40720-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said in reply to an earlier question, we are conducting a survey to establish precisely the scale of the problem. But we know, and there have been concerns expressed, that the guidance issued in 1999 is not as clear as it might be. It is important that we amend that guidance to bring it in line with the new hospital charging regulations, which, as I said, were brought into operation on 1 April. We are undertaking consultation to achieve that end.

<a name="40720-02_spopq0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Liverpool </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will review the Department for International Development&#039;s strategy of engaging with the newly-elected government in Andhra Pradesh in India following the vote of no confidence in Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, following the recent elections, officials from the Department for International Development initiated discussions with the new Government of Andhra Pradesh on their priorities and how DfID can best support their efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve the millennium development goals. These discussions will continue over the next few months and are expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that helpful Answer. Can she give an assurance that DfID will seek to serve the interests of the citizens of Andhra Pradesh? As she will know, there is considerable anxiety about the role of some of the multinational companies involved in these programmes. It would be good to have an assurance that Her Majesty&#039;s Government will give a primary purpose to DfID to serve the interests of the local people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the right reverend Prelate will know that the core of our development strategy is to work to eliminate poverty around the world. That is why we continue to work in India, where a quarter of the poorest people in the world live. Of course I can assure the right reverend Prelate that we shall seek to ensure that the Government of Andhra Pradesh consult their citizens on their priorities, which we are seeking to support, and through our own work we shall support civil society.

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Whitaker: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree with last week&#039;s <i>Economist</i> that DfID&#039;s practice of direct budget support can improve governance and increase a government&#039;s accountability to their own population?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. Many questions have been raised about the impact of budget support in many countries. We work by agreeing a memorandum of understanding with a country&#039;s government, setting out very clearly the monitoring mechanisms that will be put in place and the expectations that the partner government can have of us and that we can have of the partner government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, although the newly elected Government of India have still to clarify their position on overseas aid, will the Minister confirm that it is their policy to rely less on development aid and that they would prefer donor countries to relate more with non-governmental organisations? If that is the case, would it not be wise to seek partners in NGOs rather than compromising the position of central or state government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, is referring to two different things. It is the policy of the Government of India to rely less on development assistance. To that end, they have become a donor country with respect to development aid. But I come back to what I said in response to the right reverend Prelate: a quarter of the poorest people in the world live in India. An important part of what donor countries do is not only to work in partnership with the Government of India but to work in partnership with key states in India. We are working with four to support the priorities of those states to ensure that the developments we are seeing in some parts of India are reflected in other parts as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that Her Majesty&#039;s Government have been investing in aid for Andhra Pradesh for nearly 20 years? Will she tell us of the progress and the benefits of that aid, and how it has helped in capacity-building in that state?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Chan, will know that over the past two years, we have given some &#163;130 million to Andhra Pradesh. Between 1990 and 2000, the poverty headcount came down from 30 per cent to 22 per cent. The state has, as one of its priorities, the eradication of child labour. In 1991, there were 1.6 million children in child labour. Noble Lords will be pleased to know that between 1990 and 2000, the number of children in primary school rose from 59 per cent to 89 per cent, which means that far fewer children are labourers. Literacy rates have improved from 51 per cent to 68 per cent. So our programmes and those of the World Bank, along with the state&#039;s own priorities, are having an impact, but there still remains a great deal to be done.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_92"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </b>   My Lords, is it not the case that DfID sometimes has a difficulty in reconciling the   different views of national governments, state governments and NGOs on the ground? It surely is a reasonable proposition for central governments to say they have priorities which must always be taken into account, while the NGOs feel that they are doing a much better job and have a much better grasp of the individual situation. How do all these issues become reconciled?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. Through the significant resources at our disposal, we are seeking to work to change the long-term development possibilities in a country or in a state by influencing an entire sector, be it health or education. NGOs quite often try to work on individual projects which have an immediate impact. We try to ensure that we achieve some kind of balance between those two things. However, the reality is that if a country does not have a health system that functions effectively, although a degree of short-term assistance can be given, long-term sustainability will not happen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that so often the poverty reduction programmes put in place are undermined by environmental disasters, such as the recent floods in India? Is she satisfied that DfID has a sufficient risk minimisation programme in place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right. If we look at what is happening around the world, development gains can be undermined by environmental disasters, be they floods or anything else. We do engage in risk assessment; one of the things that we do in areas prone to environmental disaster is to work not just on preparedness but also on prevention mechanisms.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Woolmer of Leeds: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend recall, before the last election, the tragedies in Gujarat, where many Hindus were killed, and a very much greater number of Muslims were killed in subsequent problems? Recognising the primacy of the role of the Government in India in these matters, then and now, is DfID able to play any part in contributing towards the reduction of the problems in Gujarat, in reducing those tensions and the underlying causes of them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. There was considerable violence in Gujarat in 2002 in which more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslim, were killed. We have been working to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. My noble friend is right that we need to work to reduce the issues that caused that rioting. We do that principally through our diplomatic work rather than through our development work, but, as the British Government, we are continuing to work with the Indian Government on these issues.

<a name="40720-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the Government have no plans to change the law on abortion. This is a subject on which people hold strong and widely differing views. However, it is accepted parliamentary practice that proposals for changes in the law on abortion come from Back-Bench Members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes, with Members and Peers voting according to their own beliefs and values.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40720-02_spnew15"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. However, in view of the increasing interest&#151;indeed, sense of awe&#151;at the recent 4D ultrasound pictures of what a baby at three months is capable of, and the fact that babies can now survive at 22 weeks, does the Minister agree that the Government should take a lead by setting up a Select Committee of both Houses to look at how far the present abortion law is applicable and appropriate in view of the changing technologies involved?

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is perfectly true that Professor Stuart Campbell&#039;s images of the 12 week-old foetus are fascinating. But they do not, I suggest, contribute to the abortion debate. The incoming president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said that the images add little to the abortion debate. He said the fact that Professor Campbell is,

<a name="40720-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that his reply will be very disappointing to a large number of people, particularly since there is so much evidence now of better treatment and that children who have only a very small blemish such as a cleft palate are being aborted? Surely that cannot be right. In that case, should not the Government take a lead?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am pretty confident that if I said anything on this subject which pleased the noble Baroness, I would also displease a very large number of other people in this House.

Minister agrees that the time has come to have a look at how a 40 year-old Act is working in practice. A committee such as the right reverend Prelate suggests could usefully look at three things: first, whether the requirement for two doctors, under the present law, is itself causing delays and therefore later abortions than is necessary; secondly, how the law is working in neighbouring countries, where abortion on request is allowed up to the third month of pregnancy; and, thirdly, whether medical techniques have now advanced to the point where we ought to lower the upper limit of abortions from the 24th week except in cases of emergency.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, if the Government went round telling either House what subject its Select Committees or otherwise should be studying, they would probably be criticised. It is of course open to any Select Committee in this House or in the other place to decide which subjects it wishes to consider.

</p>

<a name="40720-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>In a poll of MPs in the <i>Independent on Sunday</i>, the 150 MPs who replied suggested that, on a free vote in the House of Commons, they would keep the current time limits as they are, and 62 per cent said that the 24-week time limit was about right. So, as I understand it, a majority of opinion is still in favour of the present arrangements.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that a poll of 150 MPs is not the same as a vote in another place? On the previous occasion when another place voted on this subject, on a Bill that I put forward, 296 MPs&#151;a majority of 45&#151;voted in favour of a reduction in the time limit to 18 weeks. Does he also accept that many of us from all sides of the argument very much welcome what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said about a reduction to 12 weeks in all cases other than those of exceptional circumstances and that the time has indeed come to look at this question again? Is the Minister in a position to respond to the letters that I sent to his right honourable friend Mr John Reid concerning the five recent cases of babies who were born alive during abortions and were not then resuscitated? Does he not accept that, at least on this narrow point, new guidelines ought to be issued in those compelling circumstances?

<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I was only gently and I thought helpfully reminding the House that there were differences of opinion. I quoted the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> survey to show that many MPs took a different view on the issue from that of the noble Lord. I repeat what I said about inquiries. It is up to the Houses of Parliament, through their Select Committees, to decide what issues they wish to study. I shall certainly look into the correspondence that the noble Lord is having with the Secretary of State and ensure that he receives a reply. I do not think that what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, was saying was quite the same as what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, was saying, but it will be for the noble Lord, Lord Steel, to correct the record.

There has been a 9 per cent reduction in the under-18 conception rate since the introduction of the Government&#039;s teenage pregnancy strategy. We have put more resources into this area so that women can get an abortion, when it is appropriate and meets all the necessary requirements, at an earlier stage in the pregnancy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, I declare a professional interest as one who&#151;for my sins&#151;has recently argued a case about this subject in the Northern Ireland courts. Does the Minister agree that one practical problem with reducing the time limit particularly affects women in Northern Ireland? They come to England because they cannot get abortions on the same basis in Northern Ireland. As a result, they often come late and they have no NHS funding. Would that not have to be considered carefully if there were to be a reduction in the period in which abortions would be lawful in this country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is of course absolutely right. There are some complex issues involved in this particular area. That is why one should not rush into change without due consideration, and that is only one of the many considerations that would have to be taken into account. Perhaps I may take this opportunity to remind noble Lords that 87 per cent of abortions were carried out under 13 weeks&#039; gestation.

<a name="40720-03_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_3"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Higgins </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What steps they are taking to ensure that the design of traffic islands and maintenance of signposts on them do not endanger public safety.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the design of traffic islands and the maintenance of traffic signs are the responsibility of highway authorities. Guidance on sign maintenance and traffic islands is given in the Code of Practice for Maintenance Management that was published by the Institution of Highways and Transportation in 2001. The Department for Transport supports the code and commends it to local highway authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister give an assurance that the Department for Transport will investigate why highway authorities are failing to maintain signs on traffic islands, which increasingly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

endanger road safety rather than improve it? Given that bad maintenance increases the risk that more traffic islands will be hit, will he ensure that a limit is imposed on the height of traffic islands, many of which are higher than the level of car axles and endanger both life and limb? In some cases, they resemble tank traps more than anything else.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, in response to the noble Lord&#039;s second point, the height of traffic islands depends on their purpose. Some of them certainly play their part in traffic calming measures and that is why they are particularly high. However, there are road markings on the approach to such islands and they are generally attended by lower speed limits. On the more general question of maintenance, local authorities and the Highways Agency have to satisfy safety audits of their levels of maintenance. The noble Lord&#039;s concerns reflect the fact that one of the problems is that the modern traffic island can be more subject to vandalism than in the past. Traffic islands are not only struck and damaged by cars, necessitating their replacement, but some are also prone to vandalism. That is why a safety audit needs to be carried out as the noble Lord hinted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, does not the occasional failure of traffic authorities to follow the kind of appropriate guidance that the Minister mentioned suggest the need for at least some back-up powers in central government, such as will be proposed later this afternoon by the Minister in relation to the Traffic Management Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40720-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as the House has already indicated in broad terms, the Traffic Management Bill has many merits, but the particular issue of traffic bollards and islands has been regarded as a major safety consideration, although there is concern whenever any of our safety measures and provisions falls short of the highly desirable. As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, indicated in his Question, some aspects with regard to traffic islands need attention. The Department for Transport will be monitoring them.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that mini-roundabouts often form an island in a road? Very often, cars are seen to go right across them, causing a danger. Would the Minister agree that, where possible, it would be appropriate to erect warning signs ahead of a mini-roundabout in order that people can take appropriate action instead of having to brake sharply when they reach it, sometimes going straight across?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, all roundabouts need adequate warning signs. My noble friend is reflecting the fact that many motorists have found mini-roundabouts particularly difficult. Certainly, the multiple roundabouts that were introduced in one or two places a number of years ago have created a degree of complexity that has worried motorists. However, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_97"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 97</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

roundabouts are very successful in guaranteeing traffic flow and the number of accidents on them is not particularly excessive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, it is now common practice to divide the carriageways of former three-lane roads and the approaches to traffic islands with white hatching marks. Those are not enforceable. Is it the Minister&#039;s intention to make them enforceable, thereby helping many people to avoid colliding with traffic islands and enhancing road safety by reducing the chance of head-on collisions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right that such markings are not enforceable. They are meant as a warning to motorists and an indication that they need to take care wherever those signs appear. It is certainly the case that if we are not successful in that strategy, and collisions with traffic islands then occur more frequently, we shall need to look at toughening up enforcement measures, as the noble Lord indicated. As I said earlier, as with all road furniture, from time to time vehicles collide with traffic islands. That is true of all signs. The fault more often lies with the driver than with the inert sign.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the prime purpose of a traffic island is to protect pedestrians from cars? Would he not therefore also agree that the wider and higher the island is, generally, the more protection they will get? If an incident involves the car hitting it and breaking its axle, is that not a good price to pay to protect the pedestrian?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I think the House has some sympathy for that viewpoint about the protection of pedestrians at traffic islands. But the question is about all traffic islands, and there are many traffic islands which are not designed to protect pedestrians at all. In fact, the pedestrians are nowhere near them. The islands are there to separate traffic on two lanes of carriageway. It is those which give rise to a certain anxiety over the height of the kerbstone and maintenance of the signs. It is very important that all such signs&#151;remember, these signs are in the middle of the road&#151;should be maintained and entirely visible by day and night.

As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, said, his remit was not to look at the wider intelligence picture. Paragraph 9 of his report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The issue whether, if approved by the Joint Intelligence Committee and believed by the Government to be reliable, the intelligence contained in the dossier was nevertheless unreliable is a separate issue which I consider does not fall within my terms of reference.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>It was precisely in order to meet the call for a look at the wider intelligence picture that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister set up the Butler review.

<p><a name="st_55"></a>

Are we to assume that the Foreign Secretary was not told about this by the head of MI6?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40720-04_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as the Prime Minister has made clear in another place, there are indeed criticisms in the Butler report that have to be addressed. However, I do not believe that one can go so far as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, in saying that it is an indictment of our entire system. I would also not wish the noble Lord, Lord Owen, to run away with the idea that others were not informed about the withdrawal, because he would not be correct in drawing that conclusion from what I have said. What I have done is to answer his question about the Hutton report. Others were informed about the withdrawal.

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>On 17 July 2003, the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service told the Intelligence and Security Committee that the intelligence was being withdrawn, on the condition that they did not refer to it in their report.

But C pointed out to the ISC that he still <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Secondly, there are issues of how one caveats anything which is put into the public domain, and the importance of applying appropriate caveats to intelligence is stressed in the Butler report.

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>With the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend Nick Raynsford, the Minister for Local and Regional Government. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a Statement about the <i>Balance of Funding Review</i> report which is published today and about the Government&#039;s response.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;Before I begin, I should like to say a word or two about the speculation we have seen at the weekend and in yesterday&#039;s press that the Government have plans for huge increases in people&#039;s council tax bills. This is simply untrue. I will say more about this when I come to the report&#039;s conclusions on council tax.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;The review started in April 2003. I chaired the steering group which included my honourable friends the Members for Wentworth and Corby, as well as   other senior figures from central and local government, academia, business, the union movement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_101"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and professional bodies. The remit of the review was to establish the nature and priority of the balance of funding issue and to identify and analyse options for change, setting out the pros and cons of each. We commissioned research, held a public consultation and sought further evidence on the main options for reform raised in the public consultation. We had nine meetings in all. All the papers presented to us are available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;I must first record my thanks to the steering group members, to everybody who responded to the review&#039;s public consultation last year and to those who presented papers to the group.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;Secondly, I should like to welcome the report published on 16 July by the ODPM Select Committee following its inquiry on local government revenue. There is significant common ground between the committee&#039;s conclusions and those of the Balance of<i> </i>Funding Review. The Government will reply formally to the committee in due course.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;As those who read the report will find, some of the press speculation of recent days has been wholly misleading and inaccurate. As the report makes clear:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>      &#039;The Review has been conducted for the Government, not by the Government. It follows that this report is not a statement of Government policy. It is rather an analysis of issues and options. Although it draws some conclusions, in line with its remit it does not make recommendations&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40720-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;It has always been the case&#151;indeed, it was included in the terms of reference&#151;that the review would simply set out the pros and cons of a range of short and long-term options.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;As the report states quite clearly, the aim of the review was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&#039;not to provide a detailed blueprint for reform, but to gain consensus at this stage of the argument on the broad issues, and to agree what the most likely options were, as the basis for more detailed work in the future&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>So we are at the start of this process of further work and there is a great deal more detailed thinking to do.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;The main conclusions of the review are as follows. First, like the Select Committee, the review concludes that there are strong arguments for shifting the balance towards more local funding. However, this depends on the feasibility and desirability of any measures to achieve it. And it would have to be possible to achieve satisfactory equalisation for needs in the distribution of resources between local authorities alongside any greater local revenue raising.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;Secondly, again like the Select Committee, the review concludes that council tax should be retained but reformed. It has important advantages as a local tax. However, in the opinion of the group, it will need reform in order to help people on low incomes and to reduce the impact of revaluation. Further work will be needed on the options for such reform. A fair and effective system of council tax benefit will be a vital component of any reform package. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_102"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clear, for example, that levels of take-up for council tax benefit amongst pensioners and others on low incomes remains low in comparison with other benefits.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;As for council tax bands, the report concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>      &#039;There is a clear case for reviewing council tax bands and the ratios between them at the time of revaluation&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>And I should point out that the Government have always made clear that we would want to consider these issues with other stakeholders ahead of revaluation. But the report adds:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&#039;particular care is needed to ensure that council taxpayers on low incomes living in high value properties are not unfairly affected&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>It goes on,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&#039;further detailed work is now required on how council tax might be reformed, based on a clear vision of the direction of travel&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Far from proposing a trebling of people&#039;s council tax bills, the review actually states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&#039;the aim should be to avoid significant changes to the overall liabilities of taxpayers&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40720-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;There has been much comment in the media about the ideas submitted by the New Policy Institute. It is certainly true that the NPI gave evidence to the review on changes to the banding structure and its ideas are well documented in the report. Indeed, its original paper for the review has been available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister since January. However, these are the NPI&#039;s ideas and they are not government policy. Indeed, they are not actually recommended by the review.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;Thirdly, the review concludes that the only way to achieve a major shift in the balance of funding is to supplement a reformed council tax with either re-localised business rates or a local income tax or a combination of both. None of these options would be easy and further work would be required here too.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;Fourthly, re-localisation of business rates could give councils greater incentives to promote economic development and improve links with business as well as altering the balance of funding. However, business has serious concerns, including potential risks to their productivity and competitiveness.

<a name="40720-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;Fifthly, while a local income tax would be more progressive and more buoyant than council tax, it would also be less predictable as a result. Considerable further work would be required to address the substantial technical and administrative issues and   costs, as well as the impact on individuals and employers before firm conclusions could be reached on the feasibility or desirability of a local income tax. In that respect, the report makes for difficult reading for those who regard local income tax as a simple solution. As we say in the report, the devil is very much in the detail. I note that the Select Committee takes a similar view.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;Sixthly, the review has concluded that smaller taxes or charges do not provide the potential for major change in the balance of funding. The case for and against each such option should be judged on its own merits.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;I turn now to the Government&#039;s response. We are developing a new 10-year vision for local government. We want local government to be more effective and more accountable. A fair and sustainable finance system is crucial to this. We welcome the <i>Balance of Funding Review</i> report as a major contribution to the debate.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;The review could not look at everything. However, while it does not make recommendations, it has reached a number of important conclusions defining the issues, narrowing down the options and assessing the case for change as well as investigating much of the preliminary detail. It provides a sound platform from which to go forward.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;The Government can accept right away that council tax should be retained but reformed. It is clear that council tax is far from perfect and that changes are needed. We are, for example, working with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions to improve take-up of council tax benefit. That work should continue.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para26"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;However, the report flags up the need for more work before decisions can be taken either on how council tax should be reformed or on the possible means for shifting the balance of funding. These matters need to be considered carefully and in detail. We must keep up the momentum, but we must also ensure that any changes are soundly based. As I said earlier, the press speculation that the Government are planning a council tax shake-up that will lead to huge rises in council tax is simply untrue. Any suggestion that we have opted for any particular course of council tax reform is just plain wrong.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para27"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;The review concludes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&#039;the detailed case for and against some kind of sub-national approach should be considered&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>It is right that we should do this, but not because we want to hit middle England; precisely the opposite. We need to look at options for regional banding in order to ensure that areas of high property price growth such as London and the south-east are not unduly affected by revaluation.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para29"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;One thing is clear: there are no easy answers. This subject needs extremely careful examination and detailed consideration. It is far too important to be a political football.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para30"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_27"></a>&quot;We have therefore decided to set up an independent inquiry to be undertaken by Sir Michael Lyons to look into these matters and report back by the end of 2005 to my right honourable friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir Michael is very widely respected and brings to the task a wealth of local government and other relevant experience. I can think of no one better able to take forward the work which the <i>Balance of Funding Review</i> has begun. Honourable Members will recall that Sir Michael has a distinguished background in local government. He is currently director of the Institute of Local Government Studies at the University of Birmingham and between 1994 and 2001 he held the position of chief executive of Birmingham City Council. He was recently appointed as deputy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_104"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

chair of the Audit Commission. He is a member of the Treasury&#039;s Public Services Productivity Panel and was also a member of Sir George Bain&#039;s review of the fire service. In 2003 he reported to my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the relocation of public sector jobs away from London and the south-east.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para31"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_28"></a>&quot;The inquiry will consider, in the light of the report by the Balance of Funding Review, and other developments such as new funding arrangements for schools, the detailed case for changes to the present system of local government funding. It will make recommendations on any changes that are necessary and how to implement them; and take evidence from stakeholders.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para32"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_29"></a>&quot;In particular, the inquiry will make recommendations on how best to reform council tax, taking into account the forthcoming revaluation. It will assess the case both for providing local authorities with increased flexibility to raise additional revenue and for making a significant shift in the current balance of funding. It will conduct a thorough analysis of options to complement council tax, including local income tax, reform of non-domestic rates and other possible local taxes and charges, as well as the possible combination of such options. It will consider the implications for the financing of possible elected regional assemblies, as well as any implications that its recommendations have for other parts of the United Kingdom.


</p>

<a name="40720-05_para33"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_30"></a>&quot;The Government now look forward to a period of focused study by the independent inquiry which will build on the Balance of Funding Review&#039;s work. We can then take firm decisions on the best way forward to put in place the fair and sustainable system of local government finance that is our objective&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40720-05_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<a name="40720-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for not getting too muddled about which business we were approaching. I agree with him that we face a difficult afternoon in deciding what we are dealing with. I also thank him very much for repeating the Statement made by the right honourable Nick Raynsford in another place.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The Minister was at some pains to point out that the   <i>Balance of Funding Review</i> was a report to the Government and not by the Government. But however presented, there are within it a number of areas of considerable concern.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>It is of course a <i>sine qua non </i>that when the Government find themselves in a difficult position they call for an inquiry or, in this case, another inquiry; this one to be undertaken, as the Minister has said, by Sir Michael Lyons. That clearly falls into this category. We of course wish Sir Michael well and hope, without great confidence, that he may find the road to the holy grail.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_105"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Will the Government say when in 2005 the review will report? Will the Minister also tell us whether the terms of reference of the committee, rather than the broad outline given in the Statement, will be available to the House before it is set up? Nick Raynsford was a brave man when he set forth on the path of reconsidering the options for the council tax and the relationship between the Government&#039;s contribution to local government expenditure and that raised by local government itself, which of course now includes the uniform business rate. He was brave because the options for reform have been considered on innumerable occasions and the same difficulties and objections to their alternatives outlined in the <i>Balance of Funding Review</i> report have always come into focus.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>As is clear from this report, business does not want to return to a local business rate. Business revaluation will bring untold problems anyway, and any local form of income tax is bound to raise fundamental issues, whether it is assigned from central government revenues or raised locally. Immediately one sees the problems in relation to a tax raised locally, particularly in central London, in view of the number of people who do not actually pay income tax in this part of the world and who therefore might possibly avoid it if paid locally.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>All the usual suspects are raised, including local sales tax, tourist tax and now congestion charging which is a tax which should be used, if at all, only for preventing congestion and not as a means of raising missing revenue. Sir Michael will have his work cut out to come to any conclusions which will meet any, never mind everyone&#039;s, aspirations and/or concerns. If the members of the balance of funding review have not been able to answer that problem, then Sir Michael&#039;s mind is going to have to be very superior indeed.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>But whatever is brought forward or thought through again, it is clear that the council tax will remain at the heart of local government revenue. I believe that the Minister made that absolutely clear this afternoon. If I may remind the House, it was much derided when it was introduced by the previous government, but it has proved to be a tax which is simple to collect and to allocate to property, and is understood by those paying it. That has been one of its prime successes, in that it took into account the property base so that there was always somewhere to collect the revenue.

</p>

<a name="40720-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>A great deal of the Minister&#039;s Statement was concerned with trying to downplay the reports in the press over the   weekend that the already scheduled revaluation of domestic properties, along with the possibility of increasing the number of bands and the ratios between them, would have a massive impact on people in the new high bands. It is instructive to recall that throughout the   discussions on the Local Government Bill the Government resisted all amendments which would have limited the number of bands and, if there were to be an increase in that number, maintain the current ratio of 1:3   between the top and the bottom. Those amendments, tabled by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield and myself, would at least have ensured that the elongation of bands <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_106"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would not result in vastly increased amounts being paid by those in the upper tiers. Those amendments were opposed by the Liberal Democrats.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>It is clear from the balance of funding review that that is not an option and that, whether suggested by the NPI report or the review itself, there could be potentially substantial increases if this route of extending the ratio were adopted. The Minister has said, and I agree, that no one wants families in either low value or high value property penalised by having to pay much too high local taxes. The rise in property values has been a mixed blessing to those who have lived in their houses for a number of years since the Chancellor now seems to believe that they are a suitable milch cow. The Government need to think very carefully before they accede to any proposal which will force people into having to sell their property because they cannot afford to pay the council tax. We might perhaps seek an assurance from the Minister today that that would not be the intention because there are a great number of people who are already living in properties, particularly in the south-east, which have risen in value well beyond their income if the council tax were to increase substantially.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Will the Government indicate what they intend to do about improving the uptake of council tax benefit? The Statement said that this matter is being looked at, but it has been looked at ever since council tax benefit was introduced and still there has been no resolution. I believe that I am right in saying that there are over 1.5 million people who are entitled to council tax benefit but are not taking it.

</p>

<a name="40720-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The balance between funding that is raised locally and that raised nationally, as the report brings out, is a sensitive one. That is why whenever it has been looked at before nothing has resulted. Council tax has risen remorselessly under this Government. It is now 70 per cent higher than when they came to power. A further 20   per cent rise is predicated by the Chancellor&#039;s spending review over the next three years. In addition, much of that spending is regulated by the Government in the form of passporting or specific grants. Extra costs are being borne in London as a result of the regional assembly. There is no reason to assume that that would be any less the case for any new assembly. The Statement makes it clear that is an aspect which will be looked at by Sir Michael Lyons, namely, the possible cost of a possible assembly. One ought to note that in the Greater London Authority Bill, now an Act, the expectation was that the cost to the boroughs would be three pence in the pound. That has now risen by 210 per cent since the Mayor&#039;s office came into being.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>This may not be the Government&#039;s review, but it was chaired by the Minister and staffed by people from various government departments. Therefore, it is owned by the Minister at least or it would not have seen the light of day. At least a further review of the review will put off the final day of decision, probably until after the next general election. I would have thought that a very wise decision for the Government to take, as the implications of both a revaluation and the extension of the council tax bands will serve to ensure that it is a hot issue with the electorate. They <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_107"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 107</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may not be minded to come out and vote in great numbers at local elections, but they will surely take note of a threat of massive increases in council tax rates, and/or in any other form of contribution that they are asked to make, through local tax, tourist tax, or any of the other options.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The Government are embarking on yet another 10-year plan; good heavens, we have had 10-year and five-year plans for all sorts of things recently. The council tax has stood the test of time so far&#151;it has certainly stood 10 years. The Government will mess with it at their peril. I thank the Minister for the Statement and ask that he be kind enough to respond to the few questions that I have raised. Ultimately, I look forward to the final decisions and discussions on the subject when Sir Michael Lyons finally reports to the House and the country.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40720-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for the Statement. I was also unclear which set of papers to have ready at the start of business.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The noble Baroness referred to a 10-year plan, but the Statement referred to a 10-year vision. I am not sure whether what is referred to is a plan or a vision, but I doubt that those struggling to pay the unfair and outdated council tax will feel hugely enthusiastic about the time frame envisaged by the Statement. They may feel&#151;as I did when I read it, and as the noble Baroness clearly did, although our views are different&#151;that to announce a review of a review to report at the end of next year is a clumsy way of saying, &quot;We still don&#039;t know what to do, and will postpone it until after the general election and in the mean time repeat some cosy   words about how we understand the problems inherent in the current continuing system&quot;. It must be undeniable that, now knowing something of the time frame, we will be well into the 10 years before there is any change in local taxation.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The terms of reference of the balance of funding review were to review all aspects of the balance of funding&#151;fair enough; to review the evidence; and to look at the reform options. So perhaps I should not criticise the Government for sticking so closely to the letter of that. However, I criticise them for deferring the decisions, however elegantly. When talking about elegance, I must congratulate the noble Baroness on dancing around the issues so delicately in her support of council tax.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>According to the Statement, the objective is to gain a consensus on broad issues. Do the Government not recognise that there is consensus about the unfairness of council tax, and that there will be consensus that the   review appears barely to take us forward? The Statement also refers to particular care to ensure that those on low incomes in high-value properties are not unfairly affected. We are not starting from square one&#151;they are unfairly affected today, and clearly will be next year and the year after that. The Statement refers to council tax benefit. We support encouraging the take-up of that, but the problems go far wider than those who are entitled to it.

</p>

<a name="40720-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The Minister recognises that local income tax is more progressive and buoyant. I am sure&#151;I invite the Minister to confirm it&#151;that the Government themselves want to be recognised as progressive although, at this point in the parliamentary term, buoyancy may be another matter. It is sad that fear about the overall tax take being unpredictable, which is what I understand from the Statement, might override progressiveness and fairness. The Minister may not want to commit himself&#151;I ask him anyway&#151;on whether everything that we have heard is code for a disagreement between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury. That is certainly how it reads.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Minister refers to work to do, including reviewing council tax bands and the ratios between them. There is a lot of work in that, and once it has been done substantially it will be human nature not to want to ditch the tax. I fear that, by committing the Government to such a course of action, we shall have a self-fulfilling prophecy of, &quot;We&#039;ve done all this work, so we need to stick to the programme that it supports&quot;. In any event, I fear that reviewing banding will exacerbate the problem for those with low incomes in high-value properties.

</p>

<a name="40720-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>We welcome visiting the issue of business rates, which the local government world has sought for a long time. The inquiry is to be independent. Can the Minister tell the House anything about its membership? The membership of the review group included local government representatives and others. Will he say anything about how the other members will be appointed, from where they will come, and how they will be supported? Presumably everything will come from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Can he assure us about the independence of the other members? The appointment of Sir Michael Lyons has been announced; I assume that it took place on Nolan principles, but I would welcome some comments from the Minister.
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The inquiry is to go further than local, personal and business taxes. There is a reference in the Statement to other developments such as&#151;I emphasise those words&#151;new funding arrangements for schools. What are the Government really saying about funding education and local government? Is there more here than meets the eye?
</p>

<a name="40720-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I hope that the Minister knows that we on these Benches look for the positive and try to be constructive in our criticism. I am sad that I find so little to be positive about in the Statement, but I fear that the Government have given little cause for optimism to those outside the House and another place who have protested so loudly and&#151;I had thought&#151;effectively about the unfair council tax. Those people will feel badly let down by what the Government have said today.

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I shall deal with as many of the points as I can, in reverse order. Schools funding was not within the remit of the balance of funding anyway, but ring-fencing will halve the gearing ratio for non-school services. In that sense, it will increase councils&#039; financial flexibility. That is a major issue, obviously, because education is so important.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The members of the inquiry will be absolutely independent, because there will not be any. Sir Michael Lyons will conduct the inquiry at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister. He will be fully supported, of course, by officials from across Whitehall and by local government experts, and will have full powers to call for evidence from other stakeholders. He will conduct the review on the same basis as Kate Barker did the review of housing supply. The post was not advertised, but no one will question the independence and probity of Sir Michael Lyons, given his track record and his service to local government.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>There is no disagreement within government. We are trying to show that we have learnt the lessons from getting rid of the unpopular rates. We never really had a balance of funding review and discussion before the poll tax&#151;the holy grail. The duke and the dustman were to pay the same; that was the phrase used. Those who proposed that came unstuck. A secret inquiry was conducted within government by the great and the good, saying that the poll tax would be a good idea. I shall not list the names on its front cover, because it is embarrassing for people who are still around. We will think about the matter carefully. We are affecting people&#039;s lives in a massive way, because council tax is clearly the most visible tax that people pay, so we have to be very careful about the changes.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>There may be a consensus that council tax is unfair, but there is no consensus on an alternative. Whatever people might think about a quick-fix, simple option, there is no consensus on it. I do not think that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, indicated that.

There were people representing local government, such as the chief executive of Luton council, the director of finance of Wigan, the chief executive of Manchester. The group director of corporate affairs of Tesco also attended. The local government trade union, Unison, was also represented, as were academics and, importantly, the leaders of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative groups at the Local Government Association. Let us not run away with the idea that this was a secret government cabal behind closed doors. Three political parties, a trade union, Tesco and Uncle <br>&nbsp;<br>

Tom Cobley and all in terms of local government and academics were involved in the review. They are all listed&#151;there is no secret about it&#151;so it was a report to the Government and not by the Government.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The rise in property values has not been evenly spread across the country. If that were the case, we would not need a revaluation, because the percentage and the ratios would be exactly the same. The revaluation has been legislated for and will proceed. There is the question of the economics versus the politics&#151;at some time those issues have to be in the balance. If we were to farm all that out to officials and academics they would come up with a brilliant system, but it would not be acceptable to the people. That is the role of us grubby politicians&#151;to find a way forward, to raise the taxes and provide community services in a way that is acceptable to as large a majority of people as possible. Our role is also to give local government greater accountability. At present, only 25 per cent of funding on average is raised locally and 75 per cent comes from the general taxpayer. That is partly the result of the nationalisation of business rates.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I have to say the following in response to questions: we have set up an independent inquiry and it ill behoves me to give any answers, because I do not know what it will come up with.

The amount currently raised by the council tax is something like &#163;19 billion, so even small charges are miniscule.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with this amendment I will speak also to government Amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 12. The amendments have been tabled in response to arguments put forward in both Houses of Parliament. There has been considerable debate about whether local authorities, as well as fire and rescue authorities themselves, should be included in the list of those to be consulted on the making, variation or revocation of combined schemes. To allay concerns expressed, we have stated our aim to allow for the widest possible involvement of all affected stakeholders, including local authorities.
</p>

<a name="40720-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>We did not wish, however, to list in the legislation every category of organisation that should be consulted on a scheme on the basis that such a list could never be exhaustive. That said, we recognise that local authorities are in a unique position. That point was made from all sides of the House. We think that the Bill should reflect this. They are democratically elected bodies representing people of the areas involved in any proposed combination scheme, and they are also bodies from which the existing fire and rescue authorities are constituted. The amendments therefore add an explicit requirement for the Secretary of State to consult local authorities on the making, variation or revocation of combination schemes where all or part of an area forms part of the area which would be or is covered by the scheme. I hope that that demonstrates our commitment to an inclusive approach.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;COMPOSITION OF COMBINED FIRE AND RESCUE AUTHORITIES

<br>
(1)   Membership of a combined authority, made under section 2, will be made up of elected members from those authorities that constitute the combined fire and rescue authority.


<br>
(2)   In Wales, a scheme under section 2 may not make provision for the appointment of members by the National Assembly for Wales unless the Assembly has consulted the Partnership Council for Wales established under section 113(2) of the Government of Wales Act 1998 (c. 38) (relations with local government).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_86"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment returns to the matter that we discussed last time. It is now a new clause on the composition of a combined fire authority. I will also speak to the amendment dealing with changes to Clause 3, which is consequential to the new clause.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Hand in hand with regionalisation, the Bill gives almost unprecedented powers to the Secretary of State, as we have discussed over and over again. Indeed, the two themes of regionalisation and centralisation run throughout the Bill. Coming from the Government, who have little opportunity to proclaim their belief in localism, I still find this slightly puzzling. We see that manifestation again here in black and white, with the power of the Secretary of State to appoint up to 49 per cent of members to a combined fire and rescue authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>We have rehearsed the arguments in some detail at each stage of the Bill. Suffice it to say that our minds have not changed. We do not believe that, for a local service, the provision is democratically acceptable. It will do nothing to improve local accountability. Throughout the passage of the Bill, the Minister has claimed that the power is there as a last resort and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_113"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 113</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would be used in the instance of a failing authority. I have the highest regard for the noble Lord in person, but my experience of watching the Government in operation tends to allow me to take a slightly sceptical view, when I see something like that in a Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The arguments are well known, and I will not detain the House with detail that has already been aired. I   suspect that, on this point, we will have to disagree. I will, however, touch quickly on two distinct aspects of the new clause. The first is that it would ensure that each combined fire authority was made up of elected members from the constituent authorities. That seems a sensible way forward that would guarantee accountability and representation at local level.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The second part of the new clause deals with the issue that we touched on last week, with regard to the power of the Welsh Assembly to appoint members to Welsh fire authorities. It seems to us that the provisions of Section 113 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 will be meaningless if the Government continue to legislate in new ways for the Assembly to reduce the power, autonomy and accountability of local government in Wales. Subsection (2) of the new clause, therefore, would insert a requirement for the Assembly to consult the Partnership Council for Wales, before making any provision for the Assembly to appoint members of a fire authority. That will ensure that the Assembly&#039;s proposals are discussed with senior representatives of local government in a public forum. It may not guarantee that the Assembly will listen, but it would be an appropriate safeguard to ensure that the Assembly&#039;s scheme to sustain and promote local government is respected.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>As I mentioned, the amendment to Clause 3 is consequential and would remove reference to the involvement of the Secretary of State in the appointment of members of the authority and the reference to different voting rights for different categories of member. That would not exist under our new clause. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40720-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend on the Front Bench, as I did on Report, with particular regard to the new clause. I am particularly concerned about the situation in Wales and would insist that the Assembly should be under an obligation to consult local authorities.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>There is a tendency in the legislation coming from the National Assembly Government to ride roughshod over local authorities. This is not the only Bill in which that tendency is detectable. It is patent in the draft Bill relating to transport in Wales that was recently considered by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs in the other place. Suffice it to say that the Select Committee&#039;s report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;the draft Bill does give the appearance, if not the intention, of an overbearing National Assembly influence over Local Transport Plans&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I have made my point: there is such a tendency.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40720-08_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, we have stood together with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, throughout on these issues. I congratulate her on finding a way of bringing the amendment back. We did not get quite enough people through the Division Lobby on the previous occasion. I say, &quot;Well done&quot;, and I must remember to have Wales as a back-up, when I want to divide the House again or, at any rate, bring some matter before it again. That makes my position on Amendment No. 3 clear enough.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Amendment No. 4 would alter the detail of a scheme made under Clause 2, as set out in Clause 3. I had a look back to see what the Government had to say about differential voting&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;at previous stages. We tabled an amendment that would have taken that bit out, and it did not seem to me that it was spoken to. I see no justification for giving different weight to the votes of members of pretty much any sort of authority. It leads to trouble, and it will not enable the members of an authority to work together easily and productively.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I did not read through <i>Hansard</i> for the Commons, but there seemed to be no justification for the move in <i>Hansard</i> for this House. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving the Minister an opportunity to justify it to those of us who are hanging on his words.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40720-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Baroness for bringing the matter back, for reasons that I will explain in a while. I note what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, said. I know nothing about the Assembly riding roughshod&#151;his words, not mine&#151;over local government, but local government always claims that somebody is riding roughshod over it, when it cannot get its own way. For centuries, the call has been, &quot;It&#039;s the Westminster Parliament riding roughshod over us&quot;&#151;not any more. That central change has taken place.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would challenge the power in the Bill for the Secretary to State to combine authorities. I realise that that has been a sore throughout; I fully accept that. The amendments would remove the provision about how members are chosen, while restricting membership of combined authorities to elected members of constituent authorities. The amendments would leave us in an untenable position.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Amendment No. 4 would remove powers for a combination scheme to provide for the composition of the combined authority and for how the members are chosen. The Secretary of State would not be able to specify the maximum number of members who should sit on an authority, a power that he rightly has at present for combination schemes under the 1947 Act. Reading the amendment alongside Amendment No. 3, we assume that the intention is that existing authorities will retain the power that they now have to appoint members. The basis on which those appointments <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_115"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would be made is not at all clear from the new clause. For example, how will the balance of membership be determined? Will authorities be represented equally or in proportion to their size? The new clause is silent on such important matters.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>As we have argued, we believe that the Secretary of State must have the power to make appointments to fire and rescue authorities. The Government&#039;s motivation in seeking the power to appoint is not to enhance central control but to improve the delivery of a public service. It is essential that fire and rescue authorities collaborate effectively with each other in order to deliver the modernised, efficient and effective service that we need. This Bill and the national framework give authorities ample scope to collaborate voluntarily to deliver what is required. That is the point: it is in their gift to get it right and do it themselves, without any involvement of the Secretary of State. We are not seeking to get involved. Combination would therefore be a last resort, in the event that authorities failed to collaborate effectively. In other words, if they fail to do the job, we are responsible for making sure that the job is done.

</p>

<a name="40720-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Authorities might fail to collaborate effectively because of lack of capacity, lack of will or lack of leadership. Given the new statutory framework, organisational obstacles are unlikely to be the sole cause of failure, so combining them, without more, would not necessarily resolve the problem. That is why we are insisting that it is essential for the Secretary of State to be able to appoint a minority of members should it be necessary to do so to overcome the previous problems. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State in making the combination scheme would make provision for the appointment of a number&#151;less than half&#151;of the members, who would be statutory officers under the Crown. The scheme would provide for the appointment of the remaining members by the constituent authorities of the new combined fire authority.


</p>

<a name="40720-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Should such appointments have to be made there are none the less considerable safeguards for local democracy built into the clause, including appointees being in a minority and their being excluded from votes on precepting. That would be left to those democratically elected. We have given assurances to both Houses that appointments would be publicly advertised under the Nolan principles. So in the event of the power being invoked it would be used in a transparent and proportionate manner.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Amendment No. 3 would limit membership of a combined authority to elected members of the constituent authorities only. As we have argued, the Secretary of State must have the flexibility to address a failure to collaborate by fire and rescue authorities by having the power to appoint. It is vital that the power is not restricted to appointing the elected members of the failing authorities. That would be barmy. It would be absurd to leave it to the fire and rescue members who had proved lacking in will, capacity or leadership to provide the new combined authority with the will, capacity or leadership needed to turn the situation around. Those people will have failed and have been given every chance. It is a last resort, not a first resort.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_116"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Indeed, we do not want to see any restriction placed on the type of person who might need to be appointed to a new combined authority. The Secretary of State needs flexibility to make a judgment based on the reasons for the combination. He needs to be able to appoint people chosen for their ability. I assured noble Lords on Report that we had no plans to appoint fire and rescue authority employees to a combined fire authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I can, however, now go further&#151;which is why I am glad the debate is taking place&#151;and assure noble Lords, in the light of detailed legal advice, that the Bill does not give the Secretary of State the power to override the absolute restriction on an employee of a fire and rescue authority being a member of that fire and rescue authority, under Sections 79 to 81 of the Local Government Act 1972. Nor does the Bill override the provisions of Section 1 of the Local Government Act 1989, which prevents anyone who holds a politically restricted post from becoming a member of any fire and rescue authority. The latter provision would prevent all but very junior employees of a fire and rescue authority from being members of any fire and rescue authority. So there would, after all, be no question of appointing a chief fire officer.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Amendment No. 3 also requires the National Assembly for Wales to consult the Partnership Council for Wales on the appointment of members. The Government have already conceded that local authorities should be explicitly listed as consultees on the making, variation or revocation of combination schemes&#151;that was our first debate a few minutes ago. Our fears were that the list of potential consultees to those schemes could go on and on, and so it proves. The Government have already stated their position, which is that we are committed to the widest possible consultation on the matter. We cannot keep adding bodies to be consulted to the Bill, but I assure the House that our intention remains to consult as widely as possible.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Furthermore, it is our intention that the Bill should apply to Wales in exactly the same way as it does to England. The amendment would impose a further duty that would apply to Wales alone, a situation that we have carefully avoided. It is for the National Assembly for Wales to determine which bodies it should consult, in the same way that that responsibility falls to the Secretary of State in England. The principle of consulting as widely as possible remains, however, and I hope that Members of the Committee accept this assurance.
</p>

<a name="40720-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I used a phrase earlier when I was talking about the people who would be appointed as statutory officers under the Crown. I previously said that,

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I am reliably informed that &quot;statutory officers under the Crown&quot; is not correct, so I am not sure what status they would have. However, as I put it on the record and I am now told that it is incorrect, I am removing it. In due course I shall no doubt receive a further clarification. This issue has now been raised at every stage and I fully understand why. The Government have moved on the issue, but I repeat that it is a last resort; the Secretary of State will use those powers only if people fail to organise themselves properly and efficiently. Central Government are not coming in and reorganising and combining fire authorities. It is a power of last resort.

<a name="40720-08_para22"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment would remove from the Bill the requirement that the charges set by an authority do no more than recover the full annual cost of providing the service in question.
</p>

<a name="40720-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>On Report the Minister went over the ground that he covered in his letter dated 14 June. That dealt with the Government&#039;s concession in Committee which allowed for an authority to continue recovering an element of profit on a given service if it had been doing so on or before 1 April this year for up to two years after the introduction of a freedoms and flexibilities package under the fire CPA. Although we were pleased with that concession we feel that the Government have not made the case for restricting fire authorities in the manner proposed by Clause 19(6).
</p>

<a name="40720-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The Government&#039;s decision to restrict charging for services, even taking into account the concession, is bad for innovation in local government&#151;my noble friend Lord Hanningfield, who is unable to be here this afternoon, waxed lyrical about Essex&#039;s innovative powers&#151;and will unfairly close down possible sources of income. This loss of income will have to be paid for <br>&nbsp;<br>

by the council tax payer. The Government&#039;s plans introduce a serious opportunity cost to the taxpayer, and will get worse over time. We do not agree with the Government&#039;s intentions and their interference with fire authorities&#039; charging regimes. The Government have failed to articulate why it is so important that the present system should change. The capacity to charge more than the cost of a service is important in terms of future innovation and motive. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="40720-09_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, we take a similar view, although the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, always waxes lyrical when he talks about Essex. On the last occasion that this issue was debated in Grand Committee the Minister referred us to an order to be made under the Local Government Act 2003 and we have recently seen the first wave of such orders. We on these Benches very much dislike the CPA procedures and allowing freedoms and flexibilities for certain authorities only. But much as I would like to see all fire and rescue services able to charge at their discretion, I understand the Government&#039;s logic in treating them like other local authorities for this purpose. I hope that   I have correctly understood the Government&#039;s position, although I may be corrected in a moment. It is a pity that they are doing that for any local authorities at all.

<a name="40720-09_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, for the final time we have come to what I shall call the &quot;Essex amendment&quot;. I do not wish to interfere in Essex. It is a well run authority with an excellent leader.

<a name="40720-09_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, from our party.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40720-09_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, thanks very much. I often wonder if those people who pay the charges to the Essex fire brigade realise that they are not paying a charge, but a tax, because it is obviously used as a revenue raiser. I do not know what is on the invoices or the bills or how that fact is advertised&#151;&quot;We have this extra way of raising funds and keeping the council tax down. We are ripping off people&quot;&#151;some people might say, although others, not I, would use that term&#151;&quot;We are not paying for the cost of this charge, we are putting something on top of it because we need more revenue&quot;. I do not know how open and transparent that is, but one thing is certain&#151;it is trading that is not carried out via a company. By and large when local government trades it has to set up a company properly, with accounts, because trading without a company structure is anti-competitive, I am told.
</p>

<a name="40720-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>However, I do not wish to discuss again the issue of different fire brigades fighting fires in each others&#039; areas. I shall not even suggest that that might be looked at in the Lyons review because this relates to fire service, not local government, funding&#151;although in this case it is used as a means of local government funding and, regarding the question that the noble Lord, Lord Biffen, asked me earlier, it may be a source of revenue. I do not know.

</p>

<a name="40720-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The amendment is identical to earlier amendments and my argument is exactly the same. We have made a concession openly and in good spirit. It is true that the wording of Section 3 of the 1947 Act has caused confusion among authorities about the extent of their powers to recover more than the cost of providing a service. That is certainly the picture to emerge from fire and rescue authorities during the recent consultation exercise on charging. We want greater clarity on the issue and that is precisely what the clause as drafted achieves. But I and my ministerial colleagues in the other place have repeatedly made clear that we have no wish to create financial difficulties for authorities such as Essex that have become accustomed, in good faith, to recovering a profit component on some of their activities.
</p>

<a name="40720-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>That is precisely why we announced a concession in Grand Committee when considering the then Amendment No. 65. I shall put on record again that as a result, where an authority was recovering an element of profit on a given service on or before 1 April this year, the concession will enable it to continue doing so for up to two years after the introduction of a freedoms and flexibilities package under fire comprehensive performance assessment (CPA). That will be achieved by means of an order under Section 95 of the Local Government Act 2003 and will require authorities to conduct their trading activities through a company. Authorities will not be allowed to expand into new areas of trading under the concession but may be allowed to do so if they achieve a favourable CPA. Where an authority fails to achieve a favourable assessment within two years any trading order under this concession will be withdrawn.
</p>

<a name="40720-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Our objective throughout has been to draw a line under the previous uncertainty. It is obviously a certainty in Essex and there might be other areas where that is the case, although none have come to my attention. But we wish to remain sensitive to authorities such as Essex that currently recover a profit element. We do not wish to damage them in any way. Our approach provides clarity about the way forward. With those assurances, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn for the final time.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>After Clause 22, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;INTERVENTION PROTOCOL

<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State must prepare, and may revise, a protocol about the exercise of his power to make an order under section 22(2).
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_121"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(2)   The protocol must in particular make provision about persons or descriptions of persons that the Secretary of State will consult before exercising that power.

<br>
(3)   The Secretary of State must have regard to the protocol in exercising that power.


<br>
(4)   In preparing the protocol, or any revisions to it which appear to him to be significant, the Secretary of State&#151;


<br>
(a)   must consult fire and rescue authorities or persons considered by him to represent them;


<br>
(b)   must consult persons considered by him to represent employees of fire and rescue authorities;


<br>
(c)   may consult any other persons he considers appropriate. 


<br>
(5)   The Secretary of State must publish the protocol for the time being in force in the manner he considers appropriate.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment places on the face of the Bill a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult on and publish an intervention protocol under which the powers to intervene under Clause 22 will be exercised. We have always said that we would be more than happy to follow the provisions of the local government intervention protocol in exercising those powers.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>We therefore propose to consult fire and rescue service stakeholders on the application of the local government intervention protocol to the powers contained in Clause 22. This will give the fire and rescue authorities and other stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the procedures that we will follow should intervention under Clause 22 prove necessary.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Since the local government intervention protocol is specifically designed to address the needs of poorly performing authorities, we believe that it is appropriate to apply it to the powers contained in Clause 22. However, the amendment gives us the opportunity to review the protocol if, following consultation, it becomes clear that there are additional factors that need to be taken into account. Following all necessary consultation, we will publish the protocol that has been agreed.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Coupled with this amendment is Amendment No. 8, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. This is an opposition amendment that goes further than the government amendment. It requires that an intervention code be published that will apply to all direction-making powers in the Bill and not just those in Clause 22. We do not think that that is necessary or desirable. The powers in Clause 22 are different from other &quot;intervention powers&quot; elsewhere in the Bill. They are specifically designed to deal with poor performance, so we need a protocol which reflects that, as the existing protocol, developed for the use of best value intervention powers, does.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Other intervention powers in the Bill will, for the most part, be used to deal with specific circumstances rather than poor performance. For example, the power under Clause 29 will allow us to access equipment to ensure public safety in the event of industrial action. There are other issues, so a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; protocol would not work.

<a name="40720-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I have more material, but I hope that I have made the point that our amendment relates the protocol to the issues specific to Clause 22. The opposition amendment goes widely across the Bill, dealing with other matters, which is not desirable. I beg to move.

<a name="40720-10_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I never lose an opportunity to try to be all-encompassing. However, I recall the Minister saying in Committee that he would consider the matter, and my amendment was tabled in case he forgot to do that or forgot that he was being careful and helpful. Clearly, that is not the case.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The intervention code under the Minister&#039;s amendment does not go so far as ours, but it sets the parameters that we wanted to see. We wanted to ensure that there was a protocol on the intervention procedures that people understood&#151;what should be involved and who should be consulted. I am happy to rest on that and to withdraw my amendment. I thank the Minister for having considered our original approach and for having brought forward that satisfactory amendment.

</p>

<a name="40720-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The amendment concerns whether Clause 36 unduly restricts the employment of police officers as retained firefighters. The clause penalises the retained part of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_123"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the fire service in a way that is inconsistent with the stated aims of the Bill to make the fire and rescue services flexible, effective and diverse.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In Committee, the Minister said that there would always be a possibility of conflict between the duties of a police officer and his or her duties as a firefighter. I do not believe that there have been any examples of a conflict of interest caused by this professional relationship but I am happy to stand corrected on that point if it helps me to understand the Government&#039;s position. More importantly, I do not understand why there cannot be a reasoned and rigorous process put in place that could effectively prioritise between potentially conflicting roles.
</p>

<a name="40720-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Surely, that would not be difficult to implement. There are many examples in public life where fulfilling the duty of one role ultimately gives way to another. I have no doubt that that choice would have to be made at difficult junctures, such as in emergencies, but that is why a process could be in place so that the police officer and his employers would know exactly where they stand in advance of such a situation arising.

</p>

<a name="40720-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I am also concerned that Clause 36 seems to restrict all employment with a fire and rescue service whereas the 1947 Act dealt only with employment with a fire brigade. For example, under Clause 36, a part-time police constable could not be employed as a part-time fire control room operator or in a part-time administrative role. That suggests that the clause is not only an unnecessarily wide prohibition on a police officer&#039;s right to secondary employment, but also that there may be circumstances which need not result in what the Government would presumably class as an unacceptable conflict of responsibilities.

</p>

<a name="40720-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The amendment would allow the Government an opportunity to specify in regulations the circumstances in which it will be possible to be both a police officer and fire and rescue services employee while not compromising the main intention of Clause 36. We feel that that would be a much fairer and more effective way forward for both individual employees and the retained part of the fire service, as well as reflecting the fact that many of us are able to navigate potential conflicts of interest in many walks of life without undue restriction. I understand that many people are already in that position and would be jeopardised by the clause. I beg to move.

<a name="40720-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, we support the amendment. It seems to be reasonable as it would not remove the restriction altogether, but allows for sensible, practical arrangements to be put in place. I have been unable throughout to understand the complete restriction, given what we have heard about recruitment difficulties in some areas, and those who undertake a civilian role in the police, or those who are not on shift duty for the police service providing support for the fire service. I hope that the Minister can accept the amendment. The noble Baroness is not asking him to put detail into the Bill. The amendment would allow for reflection and detailed consultation with the two services, which is important. I am sure that the police have something to say. I am aware that <br>&nbsp;<br>

we have been hearing from the fire service, not from the police on the issue. The opportunity is there for the Government and I hope that they will take it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40720-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I can give further clarification. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that we have not heard from the police, but we shall hear from the police and the Home Office now.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said that the clause was too restrictive and would prevent a person who is also a police officer being employed for any purposes, and not just firefighting. She gave examples of part-time working in a fire control room or in an administrative role. It was also suggested that a process could be in place so that a police officer and his employer would know in advance what his position would be at an emergency incident.

</p>

<a name="40720-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>We are very concerned here with the duties that a person holding the office of constable might be required to perform if employed by a fire and rescue authority. I want to make it absolutely clear that the prohibition would not affect special constables or community support officers, who, of course, are employed by police authorities, or the civilian administrative staff of police authorities. We are talking about police constables.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We remain satisfied that there could be a conflict of roles at an incident if an off-duty police constable were employed as a retained part-time firefighter and confusion over which employer had the primary claim on the officer&#039;s services. I do not think that it would be practical to agree responsibilities in advance because by its very nature an emergency is unpredictable and police officers and firefighters have to make decisions in difficult and dangerous situations. It is better, therefore, to make a clear distinction.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Furthermore, the Association of Chief Police Officers has made it clear that it would wish the present prohibition, which has been in place since 1947, to remain, not only because of its concerns about confusion at times of emergency over primacy of role, but also because retained firefighters can be called out at no notice, which could impact upon police constables&#039; ability to perform their next tour of police duty, with consequences for the efficiency of the police service.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>We have reflected on the possibility of accepting the amendment. There have been internal discussions in government and we have had discussions with our colleagues in the Home Office. However, we have taken the view that it would be wrong to introduce the power to make a change by regulation when we have no intention of exercising that power.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>As I said, the prohibition impacts only on persons who hold the office of constable. I have not seen any examples of where such a situation would occur, but this is not a change that we are prepared to make. The Association of Chief Police Officers is against it and I believe that we should take account of that advice.

<a name="40720-11_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, we have been around this circuit a few times. I do not understand the logic put forward by the Minister. If a police officer acts as a retained firefighter, he acts as a retained firefighter and not as a police constable. I am certain that he would understand that he wore that hat. The possibility that I believe is being suggested by the Minister that a police constable who acts as a retained fire fighter would suddenly decide that he was a police officer, and leap into the breach when he was fighting a fire, or acting under command, seems to me to be absolutely ludicrous. I am certain that this happens at the moment, that police officers supplement retained firefighters in one way or another, even if they are not in the front line of fighting fires. I believe that it is a great pity that the Government are taking their present line.

We have to consider that because of the nature of the areas concerned.

<a name="40720-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>We are talking about police officers, who are not on duty, undertaking this job. However, police officers are never off duty.

<a name="40720-11_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I did not address the point, but retained firefighters are made up of all kinds of people who have all kinds of responsibilities within the community. The only reason we are addressing police officers is that they are the only people mentioned. The Government may just as well restrict nurses, doctors or anyone in the community who has a specific role to play and a specific responsibility. Presumably everyone else is entitled and can make that decision and the employers can make the decision.

</p>

<a name="40720-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It seems to me very strange indeed that police officers will be excluded in such a way by definition specifically because, as I understand it, the Government are afraid that such people may forget which hat they are wearing and suddenly become police officers.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>In consideration in Committee in the other place, the Minister for Local Government and the Regions challenged those who considered that the scope of the clause was too limited, to provide better examples of the type of incident which could cause such problems. As I made clear on Report, all the examples received both in this House and the other place are, in our view, satisfactorily covered by the powers already provided in the clause and no extension of the powers seem to be necessary.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>While the House accepted that point in relation to the specific examples given, a concern remained that an opportunity to plug a potentially serious gap was being missed. My ministerial colleagues and I have reflected further on the point alongside our objective of ensuring firefighters are equipped with adequate powers to deal with the often life-threatening incidents that they face.

</p>

<a name="40720-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>While the likelihood of such an event occurring remains in our view small, we believe that it would be prudent to take the opportunity offered by the Bill to give firefighters this modest but potentially important extension of powers. The power could be exercised only where the firefighter had a reasonable belief that a fire is about to break out and, without it, there might be occasions on which a police officer had to be called before action could be taken, unnecessarily distracting the officer from other duties and perhaps increasing the risk of a more serious emergency developing because of the delay in taking action.
</p>

<a name="40720-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We have listened to what was said on the previous occasion and we believe that it is right to make these very modest changes. It is an opportunity that it would be silly to miss. The clause already gives a firefighter power to do anything necessary when a fire has broken out and this amendment will allow intervention if he reasonably believes that a fire is about to break out. Any action that he takes will have to be justified by the circumstances of the case. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40720-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>In considering these amendments there was much debate in the other place which led to the reinstatement of these vital clauses.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We have said repeatedly that local authorities are in the best position to deliver improvements in their area and to ensure that optimum use is made of the existing road network. If they fail it would be wrong for the Government to do nothing. But these powers would not be used lightly.

</p>

<a name="40720-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>We have put on record that these powers would be used only as a method of last resort. We would look for   every opportunity to resolve problems with the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_129"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

local   authority before considering the imposition of a traffic director. Even where that was unavoidable, the provisions are constructed in such a way that the   intervention order can only confer the powers that are needed to do the job.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Concern was raised that a traffic director&#039;s appointment would be open-ended, and that it would be difficult for him to disengage. One of the traffic director&#039;s objectives would be to help the authority improve to the standard where it could take back full responsibility. As such, there would be a natural and sustainable conclusion to the appointment. But in any event it is in no one&#039;s interest to have a traffic director for any longer than absolutely necessary.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>It has been said that intervention would be difficult to justify given that the traffic director would have no local knowledge or accountability.

</p>

<a name="40720-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>On the first point, I would normally expect intervention to be the result of a breakdown in the arrangements put in place by an authority. Here the traffic director would apply sound business management principles. However, in any case a traffic director would be expected to work with the local authority, drawing upon its experience and local knowledge.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>On accountability, it is important to bear in mind that intervention would occur only where an authority was failing. While I accept that a traffic director would be accountable to the appropriate national authority, the appointment may indeed be made to protect local people.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>That said, we would expect a traffic director to have regard to existing obligations, policies and objectives of the authority when undertaking his activities.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>It was also mentioned during Third Reading that intervention was an unjustifiable cost for the local authority. On one side we need to keep in mind the cost of failing to manage effectively the road network&#151;delays for businesses and travellers and inconvenience for everyone. But, in terms of the cost to the local authority, the provisions in the Bill allow the appropriate national authority discretion on whether to reclaim all or part of the cost.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Clearly, we need to guard against rewarding failure through the provision of a resource aimed at turning the service around. But I accept that it would be in nobody&#039;s interest to force payment if that draws funds away from meeting the duty in the future.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>It has been said that the intervention provisions mark a fundamentally different approach to dealing with local government. Not so; the Local Government Act 1999 allows intervention in a council as a whole. There is no significant difference between the way those powers can be exercised and the provisions in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Finally, a key concern expressed during Third Reading was about how failure would be assessed. The Bill provides that if the appropriate national authority is satisfied that a local traffic authority is failing, it is able to intervene. But it also provides for that authority to publish guidance about the criteria which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_130"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it proposes to apply for the purposes of deciding whether to give an intervention notice or to make an intervention order.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Not only is the guidance on those criteria being drawn up by representatives of all the interested parties, including the Local Government Association, but it will also be subject to consideration by Parliament through the negative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I am confident that this inclusive process will deliver an outcome that is acceptable to all stakeholders. However, to allay any outstanding concerns&#151;and I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed during the passage of the Bill&#151;should either opposition party wish to participate in this work, we would be more than happy for it to be represented on the working group which is to be established.
</p>

<a name="40720-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>To conclude, I would hope that I have offered suitable reassurance that these powers are not a big stick with which we plan to beat local government. Instead, they offer a flexible and proportionate approach, for use very sparingly, which is consistent with the protocol governing intervention in a failing authority. As such, these provisions should be part of the Bill.

<a name="40720-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, I stand in the place of my noble friend Lord Astor, who sends his apologies for not being here today, especially as the topic in question is a straightforward matter of principle close to his heart.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>It is a great disappointment to these Benches that the Government have seen fit to reintroduce the clauses on intervention into the Bill. Indeed, I go so far to say that it is a slap in the face for local democracy and the changes we implemented to protect the interests of local government in this country. As my colleague in the other place explained, this shows that the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;new localism in new Labour simply equalises the old centralism. When push comes to shove, the Government want to control all details and all aspects of every policy&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 15/7/04; col. 1598.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Indeed, the Local Government Association has said that the reinstatement of these clauses undermines local freedoms and accountability.

</p>

<a name="40720-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The imposed traffic management officer will not be accountable to those who elected the local authority. He will be able effectively to overrule their democratic decisions on who they want to run the roads, and thus not necessarily take into account local traffic schemes&#151;although I accept that what the noble Lord said earlier is possible&#151;and plans on matters such as environmental issues which local authorities have a duty to care for. Will the Minister explain how he can justify letting such an individual, or many individuals, be unaccountable to those on whom their actions will have a daily effect?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>As the Government are putting the clauses back into the Bill, perhaps the Minister will clarify for the House some issues of great concern that have so far gone unanswered. I accept that the Minister has answered some points about how the Government will decide whether a local authority is failing. However, we look forward to seeing the criteria that will be used to decide that one local authority is managing the traffic well, and another is not. Will the Government have to prove that a local authority is failing before they intervene? How long will the intervention last, and on what basis will the intervention be reconciled? How may a local authority appeal against an intervention decision? Will the Minister outline a set timetable that will be used for disengagement? Will the National Audit Office be given a role to decide if this method of intervention provides value for money, particularly in terms of additional costs that could be forced on a local authority by intervention?
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>It is clear that there remains much uncertainty as to how this power will be used, and who will ensure that it is used only as a method of last resort, based on a set of clear criteria available to all. It is an inadequate means of achieving the desirable end of less congestion, especially when a tool for sensible and practical intervention is already available.

</p>

<a name="40720-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Does the Minister agree that a scheme under the Audit Commission&#039;s comprehensive performance assessment already exists that could be utilised to judge how effectively a traffic authority was performing? Attached to the commission&#039;s comprehensive performance assessment are improvement mechanisms to assist and aid local authorities, in the form of peer reviews; the Local Government Association; and the Improvement and Development Agency for local government, which I would have thought would have made the role of the external traffic director completely unnecessary. What discussions did the department have with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister prior to the drafting of this Bill?
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It is with a heavy heart that we have decided not to further oppose this Bill. We do not want to hold up the Bill over an issue that the Government are refusing to back down on.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40720-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, said. The restitution of the clauses to the Bill is totally unnecessary and, as I said on Report, smacks of a Stalinesque attitude to local government. With the production of local transport plans, which must be submitted to the department, and which do measure progress year on year, and with the comprehensive performance assessment, which the noble Lord, Lord   Rotherwick, has referred to, there are plenty of opportunities for the Government to deal with a failing authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The approach of appointing a traffic director from outside, whose presence will be bitterly resented wherever he is appointed to, is a heavy-handed and clumsy method of dealing with someone, bearing in mind that the Government have the mechanism of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_132"></a>

withholding money from that local authority in the annual grant review if they believe that the local authority is failing.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>However, like the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, I do not intend to divide the House or call for the Bill to be rejected, because there is much in it that we like and that we want to see. I say to the Minister that with so much transport legislation likely to come in the next Session, which I imagine will be the last before a general election, much of it requiring considerable co-operation from this side of the House to get it through, we feel badly let down over this. Our reasons for sending this back to the Commons were soundly based, and if we are going to have things thrown back at us time and again, the battle over the next lot of legislation will be fierce indeed. We will not withdraw so easily again. However, I am content to let the legislation pass.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40720-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that the other place has restored these provisions to the Bill. I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw&#151;who I admire as an expert in these fields&#151;has today used somewhat extreme language in referring to the Government&#039;s &quot;Stalinesque&quot; approach. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, was overstating the   case when he said that this was a slap in the face for local democracy. It is a reserved power for the Government in an extreme situation. How can it be a slap in the face for local democracy when it can only be applicable if one, or possibly more, local authorities at some point in the future fail in their important traffic management duties set out in the Bill? There should be a power for central government by way of traffic directors to intervene.

</p>

<a name="40720-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Given the other provisions in the Bill, which I will not develop now, as to what the obligations of a local authority are, and how it can be that one can fail, no one expects authorities to fail. All noble Lords are great believers in local democracy and local government. No one expects that more than one local authority in a blue moon will fail in its activities. It would be irresponsible if there was no power whatever, in that rare circumstance, for central government to intervene. Are central government supposed to do nothing in such an instance, when we all regard traffic management, coping with congestion and so on, as so important?
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>This is not a &quot;Stalinesque&quot; approach to government. It is a modest proposal, it has been made plain what it is all about, and the Minister has explained that guidance will be provided as to what is meant by &quot;failure&quot; to carry out the proper duties. I am only glad that both Front Benches have agreed not to pursue their opposition any further after today.

<a name="40720-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I appreciate the contributions that have been made to this short debate.

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

used extremist language and to be warned about the danger of going over the top. My noble friend is exactly right. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, probably deserved a degree of my noble friend&#039;s opprobrium as well. These measures have been dramatised as centralisation measures. They are not; they are measures of last resort. There are a whole series of processes to be followed before any possibility of the imposition of a traffic officer on a local authority would occur.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40720-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Borrie, and the Minister have overlooked the fact that we have been put in a very difficult position. We do not know the criteria that are going to be used to judge whether a local authority has failed. It would have been much easier if we had known this before the Bill came along, in which case perhaps this problem would never have occurred.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40720-13_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I gave a clear indication, which I have reiterated today&#151;together with a welcome for the Opposition parties if they wish to be represented on the committee which will draw up the criteria&#151;that we do not propose to adopt criteria which are anything other than acceptable to local authorities and in which the LGA is to play a prominent part.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Even in the extreme circumstances of a traffic officer being appointed, he will have to work with the grain of the local authority. I made it quite explicit in my opening remarks today that it is not conceivable that he will operate like a <i>deus ex machina </i>with regard to the local authority, but it may be necessary in the extreme circumstances of failure. It goes without saying that the failure would impact upon the local people, and the traffic officer would be employed in order to remedy that situation.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Traffic congestion spills beyond local authority boundaries. We reflected on this point at Third Reading when we had the opportunity of discussing the congestion charge and its impact on boroughs. I was at pains to point out at that time that of course I recognise that a congestion charge imposed on a discrete area has a significant impact upon the immediate area and the people who live there, but I am sure that we all recognise, by the very definition of traffic movement, that these issues go far wider than the immediate locality. That is why a failure will, in the last resort, need to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, that the duty is applied in the first instance to local traffic authorities. We place trust in them to deliver the programme outlined in the Bill to reduce traffic congestion, which we all recognise is a blight on our transport system. The intervention powers will come in only in the extreme case of failure.

all other significant Bills, is a product of a Government who are totally seamless in their approach to policy; who recognise the importance of co-operation between departments beforehand and, even more important, recognise that delivery should be a responsibility of government. In sustaining the arguments on the Bill, the Government, as a whole, are in total agreement.
</p>

<a name="40720-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, asked about appealing against an intervention. I emphasise that it is a staged process towards intervention; at each stage there is an opportunity for an authority to make representations and to set out its plans for redressing any problems. We all fervently hope and wish that we will resolve problems in this way. By definition, if we reach the position of appointing a traffic officer there will have been considerable delays in remedying the very issues we are seeking to tackle. We want to see a process that is flexible and responsive to local authorities, but which also ensures that they meet their obligations under the terms of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40720-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I note the element of regret. I note also the incipient threat to future legislation. I understand the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who has been constructive in regard to certain aspects of this legislation. However, he has not had his way in regard to all aspects of it and he is bound to forewarn us of challenges to come. It would be a poor approach for the Government if we put forward transport legislation that was not challenged by the noble Lords, Lord Bradshaw and Lord Rotherwick, because that is in the nature of the process upon which we are engaged. However, they will forgive me if I leave the quaking of my knees to a later date and merely take solace in the fact that, as I understand it, the amendments will not be opposed today.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>Page 3, leave out lines 6 to 14 and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_10"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Meanings of &quot;category 1 hazard&quot; and &quot;category 2 hazard&quot; shall be prescribed for the purposes of this Act.<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_136"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(   )   Those meanings shall be so prescribed by reference to&#151;

<br>
(a)   hazards of prescribed descriptions, and


<br>
(b)   a ranking system for the severity of such hazards by which the question of whether a hazard achieves a particular ranking is decided by reference to&#151;


<br>
(i)   the results of qualitative assessment of the hazard in question, and


<br>
(ii)   an assessment of whether those results meet prescribed qualitative criteria.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_135"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 7, which are in the group.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The amendment seeks to rewrite the way in which the two types of hazard gain meaning. The Bill proposes meanings based on a numerical scoring system; Amendment No. 1 would specifically write into the Bill that the meanings found foundation also in qualitative considerations.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>So why have we brought forward the amendment? As the Bill stands, it would define the banding and categorisation of a hazard based on a numerical score arrived at by an inspector. It is not disputed that in arriving at the score professional judgment would also be required. A score would be difficult to defend unless there is some explicit recognition of the judgments required.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I am grateful to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which has brought the matter to my notice and to the notice of others. It has highlighted this issue because it believes that the decision should be based on descriptions rather than just on scores. The old system that the new housing health and safety rating system will replace contained advice and guidance, but it was judgment based.
<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="40720-14_time1"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40720-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Government have piloted version one of this system, and a number of problems were found by environmental health officers. Although version two has been produced, it has yet to be tested. There are still questions surrounding this, which is the purpose of raising the amendments at this stage.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>On 20 January 2004, the Minister in another place, Keith Hill, recognised the problem at col. 48 of the Committee&#039;s proceedings in the <i>Official Report</i>. On Report in the Commons, this same amendment was debated, although it was not pressed to a Division. Mr   Hill recognised these concerns and explicitly referred to the &quot;judgment of the inspector&quot;. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has indicated that regulations and guidance can address our concerns, but I think it right that we explore this fully.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The amendment would remove these concerns by explicitly basing the categorisation on qualitative considerations. It need not undermine the principle of a numerical system, but it would make it more of an underlying than an underpinning system. It would provide for greater protection against challenges on numerical calculations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_137"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Along with many others, we support the principles of the new system. It is right that the effect of housing conditions on the health and safety of occupants should be decided on the basis of hazard analysis and risk assessment. We also welcome the addition of many new hazards, as compared with the current fitness standard, and also the evidence base that has been established. However, I emphasise again the concern of many that when enforcement action is taken under the new system through tribunals or courts, such cases could get bogged down in a lot of legal and technical argument about scores, arising from the use of this system.

</p>

<a name="40720-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>It is important that court decisions are made on the basis of descriptions of the property rather than on scores. In this regard, the guidance notes that will be issued by the ODPM are crucial. I have had communications from the Minister about various pieces of guidance that arrived at the end of last week. I really have not had the time to digest them; perhaps the Minister can tell me more when replying to the amendments. We want the system to protect occupiers, but it must not become a charter for lawyers.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4, which aim to widen the meaning of &quot;hazards&quot; to include other matters of housing condition, back up Amendment No. 1. They were discussed in another place. As I said on Second Reading, there was some discussion about the repeal of Section 190 of the Housing Act 1985. The Minister in another place wondered whether this was why these issues were being raised. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the Government&#039;s position on the repeal of Section 190 of the 1985 Act.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Amendment No. 7 backs up the intention of the amendments in my name in the group. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="40720-14_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8, 9, 16, 18, 19 and 22, which are in my name, also relate to the hazard categories of the assessment. I am aware that this series of amendments was raised in another place, but I believe it is worth us having another look at their intent in order that we may be able to discuss some of the Government&#039;s intentions in relation to the assessment of housing standards and the system for defining hazards, as set out in the Bill. I also hope that the Minister might, in his usual skilled manner&#151;that is what I have written down here&#151;provide noble Lords with slightly more detailed explanations than those received by honourable Members in another place. In that regard, the amendments should be seen as essentially probing in nature.

</p>

<a name="40720-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Amendment No. 5 would amend the definition of &quot;hazard&quot; so as to clarify that deficiencies in buildings or land should be in the immediate vicinity. It is likely that any potential problems with the house will be on the premises, so my question is: what other circumstances does the Minister envisage coming into play that would not be in the immediate vicinity?
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Amendment No. 6 would require disability to be taken into account in the methodology used to determine the seriousness of hazards. The estimated <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_138"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

number of disabled people in this country varies between 6.8 million and 8.5 million. A very large number of people are not registered disabled and are not chronically disabled, but may be temporarily disabled. They may have a dynamic disability of one sort or another, which is changing, and their needs may change accordingly. They may have moderate learning difficulties; they may fall into a number of categories; they may be temporarily very ill; they will have housing needs, be subject to hazards and be vulnerable in a way that the Bill should identify and cope with. Only by defining ability and disability using a different kind of evidence-based approach will we get to the people that we need to reach if we are to make the Bill work to the best effect.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Amendment No. 8 requires that the hazard bands should be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;clearly defined by the appropriate national authority&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Those hazard bands will be described in regulations. To be effective and to stand up to robust legal challenge, they will need to be clear.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Amendment No. 9 would add &quot;physical and environmental&quot; to the definition of health. Again, we are looking for a firm commitment.
</p>

<a name="40720-14_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Amendment No. 16 in Clause 5 and Amendment No. 19 in Clause 7, along with Amendments Nos. 18 and 22, have a similar intent to that of Amendment No. 8. Again, we wish to probe the Minister to be more specific about the balance between category 1 and category 2 hazards and where such hazards would actually arise.
</p>

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="40720-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It is useful to have this large group of amendments as a preliminary to start the Committee stage of the Bill. I shall try and stick to my golden rule about not using acronyms, but I am really being tested. The HHSRS slips off the tongue quite easily, compared with the housing health and safety rating system, which I shall be repeating <i>ad nauseam</i>. So if I use the acronym it is because even I am getting tired of saying it.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I should like to deal with these amendments in the two groups in which they have been spoken to. To put the amendments in context, Clause 2 provides for the components of the new system to be prescribed in regulations. The components are: the method for calculating the seriousness of the hazards; the descriptions of the hazards; the bands into which the hazards may fall according to the seriousness of the hazards; and the numerical scores which determine the bands into which the hazards fall.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Subsection (1) defines hazard for the purpose of Part 1 of the Bill. It is a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;risk of harm to the health or safety of an actual or potential occupier of a dwelling or HMO which arises from a deficiency&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>on the premises,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;or in any building or land in the vicinity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Examples of such deficiencies are construction faults, dangerous features&#151;such as broken banisters&#151;inadequate heating or insulation, or lack of repair or maintenance.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_139"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 139</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Subsection (1) also defines category 1 and category 2 hazards. Category 1 hazards are those which are sufficiently serious as to trigger the general duty on the local authority in Clause 5 to take the appropriate enforcement action. Category 2 hazards&#151;that is, all the other hazards&#151;are those which trigger the powers set out in Clause 7, under which the local authority will have a discretionary power to take enforcement action.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The assessment of a hazard has two elements: how likely it is that there will be an occurrence resulting in harm, and the potential outcome of that occurrence. By virtue of Clause 2(3), the regulations that prescribe the method will take account both of the likelihood of harm occurring and the severity of the harm if it occurs. For example, a child may fall through a low window with a wide opening and no safety catch. The likelihood of falling out is no different whether the window is on the ground or the top floor of a block of flats, but the likely outcome will be very different. For other hazards&#151;for example, excess cold&#151;certain factors, such as the presence or lack of effective insulation, will be a factor in the severity of the health outcome.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I have made available to the Committee copies of the current draft of version 2 of the housing health and safety rating system. That document describes the method for assessing hazards; sets out the principles of scoring the   hazards and placing them in bands; and lists the 29   categories of hazard covered by the system. It also gives advice on how local authority officers should operate the system using their judgment; that is, what they should look for and what can be done on the premises to remove or reduce the hazards. Most noble Lords present missed an excellent presentation on the technical aspects of the system which we held recently in an upstairs Committee Room. Nevertheless, certain Members of the Committee came to listen to the experts who designed the system.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 7 would miss the point of the assessment and the way it needs to work. Though new to the Committee, they are not new to the debate on the Bill and they were tabled in almost identical form in the other place. Amendment No. 1 would make technical changes to the meaning of hazards. Unless they are intended to disrupt or harm the introduction of the rating system, they undermine its objectivity, which is its primary aim. It is also clear that they reflect a view that the system is mechanistic and leaves no room for judgment. I accept that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, in moving the amendment, said that the inspector would still use his judgment and knowledge, but the rating system does not deal with numbers at the expense of the inspector&#039;s professional judgment and knowledge. We have been at pains to stress that. The system of course uses numbers, but the hazard score is not determined by the system; it is determined by the inspector.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Amendment No. 4 would introduce the concept of relative standards to a system of risk assessment by requiring the &quot;age, character or locality&quot; of a property to be taken into account. That leads us on to a slippery slope&#151;that is not the hazard, but an unintended pun. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_140"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We do not argue that the rating system seeks perfection in every dwelling. That is just not possible in the 20-odd million dwellings in this country.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Some kinds of dwelling will have characteristic defects; for instance, early-20th century terraced houses may have steep staircases that increase the risk of a fall. A local authority inspector will know that and will make appropriate allowance for it. That is my personal experience in London every day. An early-20th century steep staircase would not pass muster in a modern property today.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>On the other hand, it will not be good enough for the inspector to say that, because many dwellings in his area have leaking roofs, he should play down the seriousness of that defect in a particular dwelling. The housing health and safety rating system is a tool that provides objective information as a starting point for an inspector to support his judgment of the action needed to deal with a hazard. That judgment should take on board the effect of housing conditions on the health and safety of occupants.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Amendment No. 4 would also introduce considerations of material comfort to a system which assesses the health and safety risks to occupants. That is obviously a reflection of representations that have been made regarding the repeal of Section 190 of the Housing Act 1985. Aside from any merits for a separate power to deal with minor disrepair and discomfort, it is inappropriate to introduce such considerations to the housing health and safety rating system formula.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The rating system formula will pick up disrepair where it contributes to a hazard; that is, any hazard in category 1 or 2. I can assure the Committee that that represents a very wide range of housing conditions. The worked examples that we issued in 2000 to illustrate version 1 of the rating system showed examples of category 1 hazards. We will be issuing an updated and extended series of worked examples to illustrate category 2 hazards and how the defects are taken on board. It would make for very bad regulation indeed and be confusing to those who are being regulated to try to superimpose on a regime that deals comprehensively with everything from very serious to modest deficiencies a regime that simply comes at the problem from another direction.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The housing health and safety rating system provides a tool for authorities to prioritise intervention. They can choose to tackle disrepair that contributes to modest hazards should that be their approach. Where disrepair does not even contribute to a hazard, we should hesitate to provide open-ended powers. Enforcement action needs to be proportionate and evidence based. There is no reason why authorities cannot provide advice to landlords where they judge that defects might lead to discomfort or further deterioration in the future and monitor those conditions.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I turn to the other amendments in the group. Clause 2 provides for the components of the new rating system to be prescribed in regulations. Those are: the method for calculating the seriousness of hazards; the descriptions of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_141"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hazards; the bands into which they may fall; and the numerical scores. As I said, Section 1 defines &quot;hazard&quot; for the purposes of Part 1 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Amendment No. 5 would qualify &quot;hazard&quot; by limiting any deficiencies outside the premises to any building or land in the &quot;immediate&quot; vicinity. This appears to be an unnecessary change as the assessment should take account of all factors that the inspector judged to contribute to the hazard, regardless of whether they are in the immediate vicinity. Why would we not want the inspector to consider all of the relevant facts if they are available?
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Amendment No. 6 would add consideration of an individual disability to the assessment of a hazard. I fully understand the motives behind the amendment and I am sympathetic, but it fails to take account of three important considerations. First, the rating system is evidence based and the evidence of vulnerability is mainly age related, although that would not prevent us adding to our evidence base over time. Secondly, the assessments are based not on the individual occupant, but on the generality of vulnerable people.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Thirdly, there are difficulties in trying to use health and safety legislation to deal with disability rights. We have serious doubts that we could reasonably use this legislation to require a landlord to make alterations and provide special adaptations to an otherwise healthy dwelling. There are other processes and procedures for aiding adaptations for people with disabilities.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Amendment No. 8 would require the hazard bands to be clearly defined by the appropriate national authority. The amendment is unnecessary, because we will ensure that the regulations prescribing the bands will be clear. In addition, the guidance may provide additional assistance.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Amendment No. 9 would clarify that &quot;health&quot; should include &quot;physical and environmental&quot; health. That is unnecessary. Clause 2(5) does not preclude physical and environmental health from the meaning of health. The clause merely states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;In this Act &#039;health&#039; includes mental health&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40720-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The purpose of Clause 2(5) is to make sure that mental health is not excluded. The parliamentary draftsman obviously thinks that we need such a provision, but I find it appalling, because mental health is a health issue like any other. Nevertheless, as we normally use it in legislation, I assure the Committee that environmental and physical health are included in the meaning of &quot;health&quot;, but subsection (5) is needed to make sure that mental health is not excluded.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 16 in Clause 5. Clause 5 imposes a general duty on a local authority to take the appropriate enforcement action in relation to a category 1 hazard existing on residential premises. Local authorities may select the appropriate enforcement action from the options provided in Clause 5(2). The amendment would ensure that any category 1 hazard that exists in a dwelling is one that has been &quot;clearly defined&quot;. All of us want to be sure that decisions taken <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_142"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by local authorities are sound. That is why we want those decisions to be based on an evidence-based system that helps them identify the problems in housing that matter, and to rate and prioritise them.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Amendment No. 16 reflects similar misunderstandings to those behind Amendments Nos. El and E5 to Clause 2&#151;I am sure these amendments have been assigned different numbers now, but they were certainly E1 and E5 when first tabled, so far as my notes are concerned. It fails to take into account the fact that the assessment of the hazard is a function of the inspection carried out by the   environmental health officer having regard to the guidance. Whether there is a hazard, and whether that hazard is a category 1 hazard, is therefore a professional judgment of the environmental health officer.

</p>

<a name="40720-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Amendment No. 18 is a cousin to Amendment No. 16 in that it seeks to ensure that any category 1 hazard that exists in a dwelling has been clearly defined. Again, this ignores the fact that the assessment of the hazard is a function of the inspection carried out by the environmental health officer having regard to the guidance. That, we believe, is a matter of professional judgment.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Amendment No. 19 is again related to Amendment No. 16, in that it seeks to ensure that any category one hazard that exists in a dwelling is one that has been clearly defined. We want to be sure that these are sound, and it comes down to the fact that Amendment No. 19 reflects what are apparently no more than misunderstandings behind Amendment No. 16 and Amendments Nos. 3 to 9 to Clause 2&#151;they must be the Amendments Nos. E1 and E5 I referred to. It fails to take into account that the assessment of the hazard is a function of the inspection, and this will be a matter for professional judgment.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Amendment No. 22, the final amendment in this group, relates to Clause 7, which gives local authorities the power to take particular kinds of enforcement action in response to a category 2 hazard existing on residential premises. Authorities may select the appropriate enforcement action from the options provided. These options are essentially the same as those provided by Clause 5 in respect of category one hazards.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Amendment No. 22 fails to take into account that the assessment of the hazard is a function of the inspection, carried out in accordance with the guidance that we issued under Clause 8, by a professional environmental health officer.
</p>

<a name="40720-15_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I know it sounds like a bit of a damp sponge&#151;I do not say a bucket of cold water. I have gone into some detail with this, because it is an important part of the Bill. The amendments are quite legitimately tabled for the Government to be held accountable, but I hope I have explained the general thrust of this part of the Bill. Much of what has been tabled here is a matter for the assessment, which will be carried out not on a hunch, but by a professional environmental health officer, in line with the final guidance which will be <br>&nbsp;<br>

issued in due course after the Bill has received Royal Assent. So it will be some time before we have a final version of the guidance.

<a name="40720-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   The Minister has, as usual, been very full and explicit in his explanations, and we are very grateful to him for that. My noble friend Lady   Hamwee, sitting beside me, was wondering whether people trying to listen to this debate were wondering what on earth we were all talking about.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I challenge the Minister again with my main point: those people who are going to try to make this happen on the ground&#151;by and large, environmental health officers&#151;are still concerned that when enforcement action is taken, and if somebody challenges it, the legal and technical arguments in court or tribunals could be quite complicated. They are worried about the system getting bogged down. Can the Minister say what his department thinks of this proposition? That was the one thing he did not touch on.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40720-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I asked that very question this morning, putting my former constituency member hat on. What would happen, for example, if campaigning solicitors in localities, or campaigning groups, wanted to pick off one property against another? I am assured that the nature of the system is robust enough to stand court judgments on the basis of the scoring system across the range of issues, and the fact that it relates to the property and the vulnerability of people who may be in it. It will have to be an issue of judgment in the case of a particular property. That is the nature of the situation, so one cannot draw premature conclusions. I am assured that it is legally watertight. A parliamentary draftsman has prepared it so that it does what it says in the Bill&#151;not to give anybody free advertising. But it will, along with the guidance, do that.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>It is a very technical system, as was seen when we had the presentation upstairs by the external experts who designed it. We are satisfied that the system is robust, and the way it is drafted in the Bill is fit for the purpose we intend, without succumbing to the pitfalls of nit-picking in the courts over the judgments of environmental health officers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40720-16_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I thank the Minister for that response, and for the presentation on how the system works.

<a name="40720-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The Minister, in referring to Amendment No. 4, felt that it was not quite the appropriate place for it, so I shall read what he said very carefully. It may be that there will be other matters we might want to return to at a later stage, but I certainly will not be pressing the amendment for the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40720-16_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. I come back to the question of whether a &quot;vicinity&quot; is a vicinity or an immediate vicinity. The concept of a vicinity goes very wide, and in terms of individual properties, one has to ask &quot;How wide is wide?&quot;. Would a house in danger of collapsing in the street behind be in the vicinity? I presume, if it was a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_144"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hazard to property, it might be. If there was a tree whose roots were coming through, and nobody knew quite how far but the tree was two streets away, would that be in the vicinity?
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>One has to be really careful about this definition. We have clearly defined some things, but if we do not clearly define this then the environmental health officers will use their own discretion as to how near or how far they are going on what could potentially be a fishing expedition. Perhaps the Minister has an answer to that, then I will come to the next point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="40720-16_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It would be unreasonable for people to go on fishing expeditions. It means in the vicinity of vulnerable people in a particular property. Joint entrances, passageways, covered walkways jointly shared with another property but not within the property, would all certainly be within the vicinity and be used by people in the property being inspected. I am not sure about roots of a tree two streets away, but if they are affecting the safety of people in a particular house, maybe because they are making the entrance unsafe, then I would imagine that would come within the vicinity of that particular property. EHOs would certainly not be allowed, however, to go on fishing expeditions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="40720-16_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   Thank you. I hear what the Minister says, and I shall read his reply carefully.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I am not clear why the definition of health includes mental health, which is more or less what the Bill says. I cannot think why mental health has been picked out as the only aspect of health. In this day and age, with all that we know about mental health, and all that health means, the word &quot;health&quot; should be all-encompassing. There should be no need for an Act specifically to pick out that one word. That is one of the reasons we have put in the others, to define the extent of jeopardised health. It appeared to be a curious single word&#151;and a curious aspect of health&#151;to include. It might have been easier for it simply to be removed. We needed to debate the reasons for its inclusion.

<a name="40720-16_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I do not know. I cannot say more than I have said. I regret that there is nothing in the Explanatory Notes. I am assuming that in Acts of Parliament and Bills the way in which &quot;health&quot; has been used in the past has been found not to cover mental health, and perhaps this approach involves redefining health. The fact that mental health must be specifically stated must mean that it has been held in the past that the term &quot;health&quot; did not cover mental health. For the purposes of this Bill, &quot;health&quot; includes mental health. I assume that it is included for some historical reason involving other legislation. I shall get further particulars on this, however, because I need a better explanation. That is the only common-sense view of why subsection (5) appears as it does.

<p><a name="st_149"></a>The noble Baroness said: The housing health and safety rating system&#151;I will not attempt to pronounce its acronym&#151;is to operate in accordance with guidance to be published by the Government. At the moment, an unfinished draft known as version 2 is available. There are 29 proposed hazards including falls, fire, structural stability, crowding and space, radon gas, security and so on.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Where an assessment is required the environmental health officer will assess each category of risk on a structural basis to establish the likelihood of the risk occurring which could cause harm within the next 12 months and the range of outcomes from such harm. The spread of outcomes relate to the risk of death or injuries that require medical attention, by a GP or hospital.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>This assessment is always based on the most vulnerable age group, if one exists, and is purely age related. Depending on the category of risk, the most vulnerable are either the very young or the elderly. The reason for this is that the only statistics that exist are age based.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Many properties which will be subject to the housing health and safety rating system assessment are not lived in by the very young or the very old. Indeed, most private, rented properties are occupied by students, young couples and young working people.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The guidance assessment process disregards characteristics relating to the actual or potential occupiers, except in one case; namely, crowding and space, where the number of occupants is taken into consideration.

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this is done as part of the evaluation process in all cases.

<a name="40720-16_para12"></a>

<a name="40720-16_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, helpfully took us through the Clause 2 components of the new system in his earlier inspection of the way in which we see the new HHSR system working. He did so rather forensically, I thought. He usefully set out how we see it operating. For that reason, having listened to the noble Baroness, the amendment probably misses the point of the way in which the assessment must work if it is to give an objective means of comparing the severity of hazards across the housing stock. I heard what she said about assessments and how they relate to the age of the occupant and the level of risk but she failed to make a leap of faith, as it were, involving the way in which we see the system working in practice.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Amendment No. 3, which attempts to redefine hazards as a risk of harm to the health or safety of an actual or likely rather than a potential occupier, slightly misses the point. It fails to take account of the fact that the assessment system is intended to assess the condition of the property for the most vulnerable person who could potentially live there based on the principle that a dwelling that is safe for the most vulnerable is safe for all.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>We need to know not who is likely to live there but only that such a person may possibly do so in future. Having come to an understanding of the degree of hazard, it will be for the environmental health officer to determine the appropriate action to be taken in the circumstances, which involve the property and the way in which it is likely to be used.
</p>

<a name="40720-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The noble Baroness may have failed to take account of that part of what happens after one has understood the level of hazard and risk as part of the assessment.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="40720-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   The housing health and safety rating system will probably exercise us for some time. The assessment may be done potentially for the most vulnerable but there are properties in which the most vulnerable might never live. The amount of work that would potentially have to be done to every property would be to that standard, which might not be a necessary standard. We are trying to tease out whether the standard will have to be the most extreme in every case, whatever the scoring system, or are there opportunities for people who are less vulnerable and who will be perfectly happy to occupy a property that has not been done up to the highest levels of safety and healthy existence? That was the purpose behind the amendment. My query is whether that is the case. Will everything have to be done to the most extreme standard?
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="40720-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Perhaps the best way in which I can help the noble Baroness is to rehearse the argument in the following terms. The local authority <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

environmental health officer will carry out an inspection and come up with a score, which they will take away, reflect on and make a decision on what to do. The local authority will not try to get work done on the property for no particular or good reason. If no one vulnerable is living or is likely to live in the property, gold-plated work to the property, as it were, is unlikely to be undertaken. To use a phrase that is often employed in your Lordships&#039; House, the remedy would be proportionate to the problem and relative to those most likely to live in that property. If a group of healthy, fit and active students is involved and the hazard that is there is not so extreme as to produce vulnerability to them, clearly that would colour the view of and judgment made about the most appropriate action to undertake when the environmental health officer thinks about what he or she has seen with regard to making sense of the hazard and coming up with a risk assessment. I hope that that helps.

</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment to Clause 3 concerns local housing authorities and their duty to review housing conditions in their districts. The purpose of the amendment is to introduce the review of housing conditions and to make sure that information collected is   used. The amendment aims to make an explicit link between house conditions and decent home standards. However, the Bill provides no mechanism to require local housing authorities to measure their progress towards achieving the decent home standard in the private sector. Currently, there are no data on the location of non-decent homes occupied by vulnerable people. I shall speak about that matter again in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40720-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The amendment addresses both issues and would generally alert local housing authorities to the need to work towards the decent home standard in the private sector. This is a very important area because three-quarters of all properties that do not meet the decent home standard are in the private sector. Although the Government moved some time ago to set targets for the decent home standard in social housing, it was only in 2002 that the public sector agreement target was extended to include a reduction in the proportion of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_148"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

households on benefits living in the private sector in non-decent homes. The target was 43 per cent in 2002 down to 30 per cent in 2010.

</p>

<a name="40720-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>That indicates why this is rather an important amendment. If we are going to tackle the problem of non-decent homes in the private sector, local authorities will have to collect the facts and figures. I hope that the Minister will understand that. Later, I shall move another amendment which is also important in trying to deal with decent home standards in the private sector. I beg to move.

Having discussed a little the intent of the new rating system, we now move on to how local authorities will go about putting it into place. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are similar in attempting to ensure openness and transparency in the process, allowing all those concerned to see on an annual basis what the local authority is doing on an annual basis.
</p>

<a name="40720-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Amendment No. 12 would ensure a local authority made public the report on housing in its area. Therefore, a review of housing should take place and there should be a degree of public understanding, knowledge and scrutiny of what the local authority is doing. That seems important given some of the things that have been discussed. It will be a big change, and with it will come a comprehensive analysis of a range of issues associated with housing in a given area.
</p>

<a name="40720-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Given the fundamental nature of the change and its significance, it is important that the review be published and available for inspection and subject to proper public scrutiny.

Very often it is the elderly who live in these houses, but there are also people with young families. The properties tend to be smaller so that a large number of them are occupied by elderly people who are not in a position to carry out the work for themselves.

I hope that the Government consider what I have said as being helpful.

<a name="40720-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I was almost going to say to the noble Lord, Lord Gray, that I expect to have quite detailed debates on energy and heating during the course of the Bill, but not today. That is not to devalue at all what he said; I certainly pay tribute to his work and that of all those involved in the energy action organisations. As he rightly said, the issue has always been an all-party one. I have spoken in many groups myself, sharing platforms with colleagues from other parties when I was a humble Back-Bencher and, indeed, a campaigning Front-Bencher. It is more difficult now as a Minister, being expected to have all the answers.

</p>

<a name="40720-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The clause is an important part of the Bill. It replaces, with modifications, Section 605 of the Housing Act 1985, which had its origins in the Housing Act 1969. It provides part of the strategic context for the work that local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_150"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

authorities need to do to tackle poor housing conditions in their area. Subsection (1) places a duty on local authorities to keep the housing conditions in their area under review, with a view to identifying any action that they ought to take under the provisions mentioned in subsection (2). The provisions are those in Parts 1 to 4 of the Bill, together with those in other legislation relating to demolition, clearance and renewal.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>As introduced in the other place, Clause 3 replicated the requirement in the 1989 Act to review housing conditions annually. There was some misunderstanding in the other place about what was meant by that, and we amended the clause to reflect more closely the current approach to local housing strategies, which local authorities are now expected to update periodically to cover a three-year to five-year period. The requirement in Clause 3 to keep the housing stock under review remains important, but the obligation to do so annually was out of kilter with that approach to strategies.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The purpose of the clause is to ensure that a local authority maintains a current awareness of the state of the housing stock in its area, so that it can come to a well-informed judgment on the action that it needs to take. The purpose of the clause is not to require an authority to produce reports at particular intervals, although we expect them to keep records which can be made available.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert into Clause 3 an extra duty on local authorities, when they are reviewing housing conditions in their area, to have regard to the decent homes targets or any other non-statutory targets set by the Government. As many colleagues will be aware, the decent homes standard and associated targets for both socially rented and private sector stock are important policy issues for the Government, and are vital in ensuring that the overall objective of housing policy&#151;that everyone has the opportunity to live in a decent home&#151;is met. However, the standard and targets are non-statutory. The basis on which they are being delivered is through the public sector service agreements between the Treasury and my department&#151;the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Flowing from that is a framework of policy guidance and financial support to local authorities, to enable them to deliver.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The guidance that we have issued to local authorities on the decent homes target already sets out in detail the monitoring requirements that should be undertaken at local level to ensure that various milestones towards meeting the targets will be achieved. For private sector housing, we are asking local authorities to undertake periodic stock-condition surveys, to assess progress in making decent the homes of vulnerable households. As one of the noble Baronesses said, the biggest percentage of non-decent homes in the country is in the private sector. Local authorities are also required for the purposes of best-value indicators to measure progress in improving housing conditions in their area. Such progress will be monitored closely by my department, working with the government offices and the Audit Commission to ensure that the targets are met.

<a name="40720-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>In the light of that very substantial policy framework for delivering decent homes which already exists, it would not be right to make the amendment to Clause 3. The framework is non-standard, and the Government do not intend to change that. I do not want to open up another debate at the moment, as I have no doubt that we will come to it later. However, we do not want to open any door to a fourth way for local authorities, people who might want to kid themselves, or people who are lying through their teeth to local authority council tenants about there being a fourth way&#151;extra money&#151;to meet the decent homes standard. There are only three ways, as everyone knows. They are: large-scale voluntary stock transfer; private finance initiative, in which the houses or homes remain under the ownership of the local authority; and arm&#039;s-length management organisations, again at which point the houses or homes remain in the ownership of the local authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Those are the three ways. There is no fourth option. I want to get that on record, for the avoidance of any doubt in future with campaigning noble Lords or noble Baronesses who might have other views. I have to make that clear, because I was at a local authority on Friday and was handed a leaflet&#151;not by the authority, but by some of the local people campaigning&#151;that said that there were four ways for decent homes, one of which was for them to remain council tenants. People can remain tenants in homes with ownership by the council, but there is no fourth way. I want to make sure that there is no back door to a fourth way. I hope that that is useful for further debates on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Amendment No. 12 attaches to the duty to review housing conditions a requirement to publish a report of the review. Those reviews are ongoing, however. The amendment also asks authorities to publish details of the action that they propose to take, and details of their intentions as regards any discretionary licensing. The amendments somewhat miss the point. Clause 3 is a strategic rather than an enforcement provision. In respect of discretionary licensing, Clauses 55 and 77 already make substantial provision, including consultation before the designation of additional or selective licensing. Amendment No. 13 adds a requirement for local housing authorities to publish an annual report in relation to review of housing conditions. It is not clear whether that is the report already referred to in Amendment No. 12.
</p>

<a name="40720-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>As I said, local-authority housing strategies are now on a more statutory basis following the Local Government Act 2003. Section 87 of that Act enables the Secretary of State to require an authority to have a strategy in place, to require it to produce a statement and to influence the content of that statement. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, through the government offices, works with local authorities to ensure the production of &quot;fit for purpose&quot; housing strategies which are current for at least three years. The plans are expected to include effective delivery of decent homes&#151;now extended to the private sector, which is absolutely crucial because of the large number of vulnerable people involved.

As he got to his feet, it occurred to me that the housing strategy was applicable to the issue and that we needed to take note of it. None the less, the reviews will not take place very quickly, simply because of the extent of the work that will be required and the number of environmental health officers who will need to be employed.

That was in an authority that was really well funded and resourced. One could see that, whether the issue had priority or not, it could be a slow job, especially in areas where property is in relatively poor condition anyway. It would seem sensible that there should be some review of what was being undertaken and why, if there were so many properties to be dealt with that there was some slowing down. We were interested to know how many properties were being surveyed, what the outcome was and, if there were targets, whether they were or were not met. That was the purpose of the amendment. I hear what the Minister says, and we may or may not return to that at a later stage.

<a name="40720-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It is a simple, short and clear amendment, but I have to disappoint the noble Baroness&#151;I will not be able to accept it. I hope that I have sufficient reasons to explain why.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>Clause 4 replaces with modifications Section 606 of the Housing Act 1985. That section places a duty on the proper officer of a local authority to make a report to the authority if he considers that a dwelling house or a house in multiple occupation is unfit for human habitation or that an area should be dealt with as a clearance area. It also requires a proper officer, as distinct from the authority itself, to inspect such a property or area in response to a complaint by a justice of the peace or a parish or community council that the property is unfit or the area should be cleared.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>We introduced amendments in the other place to set out the meaning of Clause 4 more clearly. In particular, they reduced the prominence that it appeared to give to complaints made through justices of the peace and parish or community councils, and gave more emphasis to the day-to-day responsibility of authorities to determine whether an inspection is necessary. That responsibility arises both in response to complaints and as a follow-up to their reviews of housing conditions in their area under Clause 3.

</p>

<a name="40720-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Clause 4(1) now requires a local authority to consider whether to inspect a property in its area to establish whether or not there is a category 1 or category 2 hazard. A duty to consider arises either from the authority&#039;s review of housing conditions under Clause 3 or for any other reason. Under subsection (2), where a proper officer of an authority has received an official complaint from a justice of the peace or a parish or community council that a category 1 or 2 hazard may exist on residential premises, or that an area should be dealt with as a clearance area, the proper officer must inspect the premises or area.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Inspections of premises under Clause 4 must be carried out in accordance with the regulations referred to in Clause 4(4). Where, following an inspection made as a result of an official complaint, the proper officer is of the opinion that a category 1 or 2 hazard exists on residential premises, or that an area should be declared a clearance area, subsection (6) requires him to make a report in writing to the authority without delay, which must be considered as soon as possible.

</p>

<a name="40720-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Amendment No. 14 adds an unspecified number of elected members to those who can make an official complaint. It is not clear who determines what the number will be or what the criteria are. Aside from that, we do not believe that this addition serves any practical purpose. Authorities will generally investigate all complaints as a matter of policy. There is a potentially long list of worthy people we might add to our list.

</p>

<a name="40720-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>We admit to other misgivings about trying to introduce a political dimension to the issue. We should trust authorities to exercise sensible discretion when it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_154"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

comes to complaints. People will not be slow to use this process, whether they be parish councillors, district councillors or members of the other place. In this case, we do not see the justification for adding Amendment No. 14 to the Bill. Authorities will generally take all reasonable steps to investigate all reasonable complaints as a matter of council policy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40720-19_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. The wording of the Bill is odd. It effectively says that an official complaint can only be made by a justice of the peace or a parish or community council. Any other complaint is presumably not an official complaint, which can therefore be ignored by the health or housing authority if it wishes.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Perhaps this is where the difficulty lies, because if someone makes a complaint, one would expect it to be taken seriously. However, why does the Bill then introduce an official complaint? In order to get a justice of the peace to do anything about it, someone will have to get the justice of the peace or the parish council involved.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The phrasing of the amendment may not be ideal, but an official complaint has to be able to be made by a residents&#039; association or a group of electors. I can think of a house in my borough that was a disaster zone for a number of years. It was not a matter of official complaints&#151;complaints were falling out all over the place. It is important that people feel entitled to complain. They will, regardless of the Bill, but the wording of the Bill is infelicitous.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="40720-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The language of the clause came from elsewhere. It replaces Section 606 of the 1985 Act. I do not know where that section came from, but I have already referred to a 1969 Act. It is probably old language, because, while there might be 8,000 to 10,000 parish councillors in the country, huge areas of the country are not covered by parish councils. Most big cities are not parished&#151;I think that they ought to be, but they are not. However, that does not stop complaints being made, and any good local authority&#151;do not forget that local authorities are checked over by the Audit Commission these days&#151;will have a complaints policy. If they do not, they should, and I cannot imagine a local authority without one.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Complaints that are reasonably made about houses and conditions in their areas will generally be investigated as a matter of policy. I am quite happy to get a note on this matter to the noble Baroness, Lady   Hanham. The language is probably an ancient throwback to previous legislation, which has been transferred from one Act to another. As I said, parish councils do not cover the whole country, so it would be quite wrong to disadvantage people who might not be   able to make a complaint just because they do not have a parish council.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="40720-19_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I would be grateful if the Minister would look into it. I do not think that my amendment is correct. I am trying to ensure that anybody has a right to make an official complaint <br>&nbsp;<br>

while trying to protect against people being awkward and difficult. It may be that subsection (3) needs to be removed unless there is a very good reason&#151;which the Minister looks as if he might have.
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="40720-19_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Official complaints, as defined in the Bill and elsewhere, are meant to be rare. Ordinary complaints&#151;there are several categories, including dire complaints and urgent complaints&#151;are complaints none the less. There is no reason to believe that they will be devalued simply because there is a process for making an official complaint.
</p>

<a name="40720-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The noble Baroness should look at subsection (3)(a), the first part of the subsection that she wants to amend: justices of the peace are all over the place. Although I do not want to encourage people to knock on their doors, there are a lot of JPs in the country and all areas are covered. However, that relates to an official complaint. It is intended that that will be a rarity, as opposed to ordinary complaints. Ordinary complaints are not devalued because they are not official complaints.

<a name="40720-19_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I do not wish to prolong the discussion, but the more I look at the clause, the more concerned I get.

<a name="40720-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said. On the face of it, what he asks for is not unreasonable. However, I shall go through Clause 4 and its operation, because I think that, having listened to what I have to say, the noble Lord will probably think that we are acting entirely reasonably.
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Clause 4 requires the proper officer, as distinct from the authority itself, to inspect a property or area in response to a complaint from a justice of the peace or a parish or community council that the property is unfit or the area should be cleared. We had some discussion about the history of that, and I shall come to my view on that in a while. If, following an inspection carried out as a result of an official complaint, the proper officer is of the opinion that a category 1 or category 2 hazard exists in any residential property in the district or that an area should be declared a clearance area, subsection (6) requires him to make a report in writing to the authority without delay, and subsection (7) requires the authority to consider the report as soon as possible.

</p>

<a name="40720-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Amendment No. 15 would add the requirement that, where the report of an inspection that follows an official complaint recommends that the area should be declared a clearance area, the authority must make the report available, on written or even oral request, to any interested parties. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made a plea for local people to know. That is fine, and I have no doubt that local authorities, acting in the way anticipated in the clause, will have to advertise the action that may be taken and the reasons for it. My question is this: to whom precisely are the reports to be given? In the context of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, who is an interested party, and how would the authority determine that? There are no clues in the amendment. Should an authority be responding to an oral request? How is the person who requested the report to establish that the request has been properly made?
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Obviously, we appreciate the case for openness, although it is arguable that the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ought to be the conduit for the release of information by central or, as in this case, local government, but why specifically these reports? We need to consider carefully what is likely to happen in practice. First, official complaints are likely to be few. There is no evidence that authorities receive many of them now. A question that almost came up in the debate was why the concept of an official complaint had been retained. The answer is interesting. Apparently, during consideration of the draft Housing Bill, there was no such provision. The Government were persuaded in the other place that we should retain the procedure.
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker put his finger on it: the provision has been there for many years. It was in the 1969 Act, I think, and my guess is that it probably goes back to some of the early legislation about fitness <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of premises and properties in the early 20th century and maybe even slightly before that. On a personal note, I have a feeling that it is probably because of the unique role that magistrates at one point had in considering the fitness of premises that it retains a place in the legislation. I can remember, as a housing activist and housing adviser in the early 1980s, using magistrates&#039; courts as a means of taking enforcement action against reluctant landlords. Perhaps part of that procedure involved the concept of an official complaint, so that the information that the magistrate received led to an action. There was, perhaps, an obligation on the local authority further down the line to take action in some way. I think that that is where the legislation is coming from.

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>We were persuaded to retain the provision. It is a historical hangover, but it may have some use. In the circumstances that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, described, it is likely that the local authority would want to ensure that local residents were well informed. However, we must consider carefully the terms on which reports should be requested, who should have the right to request them, the circumstances in which they can be requested, and how the requests would be properly made and recorded. I am concerned by the notion that detailed information should be supplied simply on the back of an oral request, when that is somewhat informal.

</p>

<a name="40720-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>The occasions on which a proper officer will recommend that an area be declared a clearance area are, in the circumstances that I have outlined, likely to be extremely rare. A clearance recommendation presupposes that a large number of properties have been inspected following an official complaint. It is far more likely that the authority itself will initiate the action, leading to a clearance declaration, as part of the review under Clause 3. Clearance declarations follow the procedures set down in Section 289 of the 1985 Act, as amended by this Bill. If they proceed, the owners and occupiers of the property affected must be consulted. There is an obligation in the legislation, which was enacted by the noble Lord&#039;s party when it was in government. On balance, we consider the requirement to make such reports available unnecessary and difficult to operate in the circumstances suggested by the noble Lord, although we appreciate the spirit of openness that lies behind the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 are similar in their intent. One relates to the making of demolition orders, the other to the making of clearance orders. Again, the question arises of whom the reports should be made to. Who is an interested party? How do we define that? How is the local authority to determine it? There is also the vagueness of the oral request and the way in which such a request is logged and made clear in the local authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I recognise the case for openness. I understand the spirit in which the amendment was moved. We believe that the concept of openness is carefully enshrined in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 with which local authorities must comply. I am not persuaded that anything further is needed given the general legislation to which I referred and the requirements in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

1985   Act for notice of demolition orders to be given. We think&#151;and I am sure that the noble Lord will agree, particularly as his party put it in place&#151;that that legislation is clear and easy to operate through the local authority. Having heard that explanation I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40720-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that detailed reply. Part of his answer related to the Freedom of Information Act, so it will be difficult to deny people access to the information if they want it. Some of the decisions will be controversial; for example, planning decisions where people are concerned about what is happening to properties next to existing properties. These days, people want openness and the most information possible to be made available on planning decisions.
</p>

<a name="40720-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>I can see that some of the decisions will be controversial. I understand the Minister&#039;s point on magistrates. We have moved on a great deal and most of the action will be taken by local government under this part of the Bill. The Minister accepted that there should be openness. We are suggesting that the information should be available to those who request it. It would probably be a job to prevent that anyway under the Freedom of Information Act. As the Minister went along with what we were saying I do not understand why the Government cannot accept the amendment. It would probably be a job to refuse it.

I invite him to reconsider the woolliness of his proposition, because the questions I posed back to him about who an interested party might be and whether we should accept mere oral requests for detailed information would probably trouble some local authorities&#151;perhaps not his own because it is not a housing authority, but certainly the district authorities that operate within Essex County Council.

It would make available to any interested party&#151;and we are talking about clearance areas, which are always controversial&#151;reports that would probably cost a great deal of money to draw up. What about the financial impact on the local authority if hundreds of people want information? As worded, the amendment means that the local authority would have to give any report to any interested party. Who will decide who is an interested party? That is a potential conflict. Or how does one prove that an oral request by telephone was made? The amendment&#039;s intention is good, but not only is it woolly, it would be damaging to the Bill.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40720-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   I am confused, but happy to be confused at a higher level. It is easy to define interested parties under law. It is easy to consider what currently happens in the planning world. When a planning application is made, an announcement is made and interested parties can consider it. Little notices go up on lamp posts and residents&#039; associations or interested parties often get together and may define themselves. It is only a question of defining &quot;interested parties&quot;, which would not be difficult.
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40720-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We seem to have had a great deal of debate on the issue. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, local authorities have to respond in considerable detail to planning applications. Many planning applications are controversial, particularly when one wants to build on areas and neighbourhoods where people do not want building. Planning authorities receive hundreds of requests for information and detail about planning applications which they cannot refuse. This would be no different.

<p><a name="st_183"></a>The noble Lord said: Both Amendments Nos. 17 and 20&#151;which is in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock&#151;should be seen as consequential to the removal of Clause 50. I will therefore comment on why we believe the clause is unnecessary. The minded-to procedure was introduced by the last government as a measure of deregulation. Its repeal is now proposed by the present Government as a measure of deregulation.

</p>

<a name="40720-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The procedure was introduced under Sections 81 to 86 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 as a deregulatory measure to save costs and avoid formal regulatory action being taken when it could be avoided. It was the answer to widespread concerns by landlords that local authorities were proceeding immediately to service of formal notice.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Under the minded-to procedure, before serving a formal notice the local authority must serve a notice of its intention to do so and give the landlord the opportunity to object and make representations. This includes a right for the landlord to appear in front of an officer appointed by the local authority to make representations before any informal action is taken. This procedure can be overridden in urgent cases.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Experience has shown that the procedure has worked well. It removes a source of friction between local authorities and landlords. It gives the landlord an opportunity to negotiate with the local authority. More time may be needed to do the work or it may be agreed that substitute works are satisfactory or indeed a particular item may not need to be done at all. In the majority of cases in response to the minded-to notice the landlord has given an undertaking to do the work so as to avoid service of formal notices.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The landlords&#039; association in Leeds&#151;the Leeds Property Association&#151;has had direct experience of the operation of the procedures and they have worked well in practice. The ODPM has argued that the enforcement concordat provides an alternative, but that is only guidance from central Government and not binding in law. In any case, particularly in relation to HHSRS there will be a mandatory duty under primary legislation to serve notices. There is a mandatory duty to serve notice where a category 1 hazard exists, under Sections 5(2) and (3). The retention of the minded-to procedure would allow less formal procedures to be adopted in the first instance.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The serving of a formal notice attracts a fee of up to &#163;300. The imposition of fees of this magnitude will lead to hostility between landlords and EHOs. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The Bill rightly contains, in Schedule 5, Parts 1 and 2, a consultation procedure to enable representations to be made before an HMO licence is issued, varied or refused, Why, therefore, cannot a similar procedure be retained for the service of notices especially those under Part 1 of the Bill, in respect of the HHSRS. If there is no preliminary procedure a landlord served with a notice may well have to make a protective appeal to the residential property tribunal if he contests certain aspects of the notice. There are strict time limits for such appeals. Although there is power for the tribunal to extend the time for appealing there is no guarantee of this. Unnecessary appeals may be needed simply to protect the landlord&#039;s position.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Formal service of a notice automatically sets the landlord in confrontation with the local housing authority, whereas the minded-to procedure enables good relations to be maintained so that the landlord can work with the authority to tackle a problem. If a landlord fails to take remedial action the option of serving a formal notice remains, although in most cases that would not be required. Abolishing the minded-to procedure is an unnecessary piece of heavy-handed regulation that is not conducive to creating a constructive atmosphere in which landlords and local authorities can co-operate.

<a name="40720-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Clause 5 imposes a general duty on a local authority to take the appropriate enforcement action in relation to a category 1 hazard existing on residential premises. Authorities may select the appropriate enforcement action from the options provided in subsection (2). It operates somewhat like a menu. If the intention behind Amendment No. 17 is to retain the minded-to procedures&#151;which is the intention of both noble Lords&#151;the amendment is defective. The amendment attempts to add deferred action notices under Section 86 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 to the menu of options open to an authority with housing responsibilities to deal with a category 1 hazard. Deferred action notices are in fact provided for under Section 81 of the 1996 Act. Section 86 deals with what are known as &quot;minded-to&quot; notices.
</p>

<a name="40720-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>This is a pre-notice procedure in which the authority must give the reasons for its proposed action and it allows the person served with the notice the opportunity to make representations. We have consulted twice on the repeal of the minded-to notices&#151;first, as far back as 1998 in a paper on changes in principle to the fitness standard and again in a paper in 2001 on the detailed proposals for the HHSRS procedure. At that point there was broad support to remove them. I am aware that there are still those who would retain those procedures.

</p>

<a name="40720-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Repeal of the minded-to procedures is in part a deregulatory measure. It was seen as costly and bureaucratic and a potential delaying tactic by owners who wanted to stall the improvement of their property. It is unnecessary where informal procedures are already in place. As the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, we have encouraged authorities to sign up instead to the enforcement concordat. The great majority have done exactly that. The concordat commits authorities to good enforcement practice, including consultation with those affected by their enforcement powers, providing information and discussing compliance failures. The minded-to procedures are unnecessary because of the success of the concordat. This is why the Government have long advocated their repeal.

</p>

<a name="40720-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I should declare an interest because I have a feeling that in my earlier life in the Local Government Association I was partly responsible for encouraging the development of concordats. I recall that I may even have attended the signing ceremony in March 1998&#151;although I should not wish to be pressed on that. I certainly remember the concordat process and I had the impression at that stage that local authorities preferred the concordat&#151;with its degree of informality, its pre-consultative format and an agreement to engage with those affected by enforcement action&#151;rather than having to go through what was sometimes seen as the activation of a pre-enforcement process being used just to delay appropriate enforcement action.

</p>

<a name="40720-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, wanted to be persuaded. Perhaps I should make a final point. Over time we have encouraged local authorities to sign up to the concordat. We have been impressed by their coverage. The statistics suggest that some 96 per cent of all central and local government organisations with enforcement functions have adopted the enforcement concordat. So its coverage is almost universal. As a result of that success we do not think that the minded-to process has any great merit and we want to see this element of deregulation because it reduces bureaucratic burdens on local authorities. That would be to local authorities&#039; benefit and would reduce burdens on them because we want them to act in a more precise way. It is perhaps ironic that both opposition Front Benches are urging us to retain something which we see as a bureaucratic burden. We are arguing for its removal because what local authorities have done has worked so well, particularly through the operation of the concordat. We want to see the application of that rather than a bureaucratic straitjacket.

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, believes that that would provide a necessary protection for landlords.

<br>
(4)   A copy of the statement prepared under subsection (2) must accompany every notice, copy of a notice, or copy of an order which is served in accordance with&#151;


<br>
(a)   Part 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act (service of improvement notices etc.),


<br>
(b)   Part 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act (service of copies of prohibition orders etc.), or


<br>
(c)   section 268 of the Housing Act 1985 (service of copies of demolition orders),


<br>
in or in connection with the taking of the relevant action.


<br>
(5)   In subsection (4)&#151;


<br>
(a)   the reference to Part 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act includes a reference to that Part as applied by section 27(7) or 28(7) (hazard awareness notices) or to section 39(7) (emergency remedial action); and


<br>
(b)   the reference to Part 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act includes a reference to that Part as applied by section 42(4) (emergency prohibition orders).


<br>
(6)   If the relevant action consists of declaring an area to be a clearance area, the statement prepared under subsection (2) must be published&#151;


<br>
(a)   as soon as possible after the relevant resolution is passed under section 289 of the Housing Act 1985, and 


<br>
(b)   in such manner as the authority consider appropriate.&quot;</p>

<a name="40720-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>We believe that the new clause responds positively to the Joint Committee&#039;s concerns without placing local authorities under a significant additional burden. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Clause 8 [<i>Guidance about inspections and enforcement action</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40720-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 24:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>Page 6, line 42, leave out &quot;may&quot; and insert &quot;shall&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>The noble Lord said: The thrust of these amendments is to tease out a little more about guidance for the enforcement and inspection regime and the resulting costs to local authorities.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Subsection (1) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;The appropriate national authority may give guidance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>It is clear that guidance does not have to be given, which is why we suggest in Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 that it &quot;will&quot; give guidance. The appropriate national authority would therefore be under a duty to give guidance rather than merely having the power to do so.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Amendment No. 26 would add paragraphs (e), (f), (g) and (h). Paragraph (e) would make transparent the training expected of environmental health officers. It is clear what the roles to be undertaken under the new system will require but one ought to be specific about what is required of local authorities rather than the rather vague provision in the Bill as it stands.

</p>

<a name="40720-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Paragraph (f) is proposed because certain specifications are expected of local authorities. Paragraphs (g) and (h) also add to the guidance. We are trying to expand the degree of guidance needed so that the time and cost implications for local authorities are much clearer and more quantifiable. We want the situation to be clear so that authorities know what the costs are, and so that the Local Government Association can make representations to the Government for proper funding.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Amendment No. 27 would ensure that any guidance issued under this section is properly scrutinized by both Houses of Parliament rather than simply being published by the Government.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Amendments Nos. 35 and 38 would provide an avenue for a local authority to seek suitable guidance in regard to the issuing and contents of prohibition orders from the appropriate national authority.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>We are attempting to probe the Government&#039;s thinking a little on the system that the Bill envisages. It would surely be preferable to have a system that is easily understood, with uniformity throughout the country. There appears to be nothing at present that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_166"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

restricts one local authority from interpreting this part of the Bill significantly differently from a neighbouring local authority. Circumstances will obviously change from area to area and, indeed, from district to district whatever the Government do. Surely allowing each local authority recourse to the national authority is a sensible step. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40720-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I regret that my response to the amendments will be a lot longer than the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. He said that he was probing the Government. I am all in favour of spending time on the early parts in the hope that we can avoid later amendments. One of these days we might even be able to miss out a stage.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Clause 8 enables the appropriate national authority to give guidance to local housing authorities on the exercise of their functions under Part 1. Our intention is that the guidance will fall broadly into two categories: guidance about the way in which properties are inspected and the way in which hazards are assessed, using the housing health and safety rating system; and guidance about the way in which authorities, when they have established that a hazard exists, can use the enforcement duties and powers provided in Part 1. Those relate to the use of improvement notices, prohibition orders, hazard awareness notices, demolition orders, clearance and the use of emergency measures.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Amendment No. 24 would place the appropriate national authority under a duty to give guidance, which we think is unnecessary. I can assure Members of the Committee that we intend to issue that guidance. It has already been made available in draft.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>On Amendment No. 25, we are not sure what the difference is. Noble Lords will be aware that precursors of Amendment No. 26 were debated thoroughly in the other place. There was a Division, but the argument is obviously not convincing so I shall try again&#151;hence the extra time that it will take.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Amendment No. 26 adds to the topics on which guidance may be given. We are not convinced that the additions are necessary. More that that, all but the reference to fire safety, which is important, are entirely inappropriate in guidance about the use of the enforcement tools available to authorities. It is the case that authorities need to ensure that their officers are appropriately qualified and experienced to carry out their work on behalf of the authority. Authorities will also need to consider the costs of enforcement action to themselves as well as to property owners.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>We suspect that Amendment No. 26 reflects continuing nervousness over the change to a risk assessment system. But we should not have too many qualms about current competence and experience of environmental health practitioners. I have heard no criticism of those professional officers. They are highly respected and regarded by all sections of society. They have an extremely interesting job, given the range of things in which they can become involved. The rating system requires a change of approach by local authorities. But the housing health and safety rating <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_167"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

system is essentially a tool to assist professional judgment. It makes transparent the process environmental health practitioners already go through in judging fitness.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>They are already trained in the use of risk assessment methods. The Housing Minister in the other place, Keith Hill, referred to an account of their members given by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in their response to consultation on the enforcement guidance. The CIEH pointed to environmental health practitioners&#039;,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;experience in risk assessment procedures and ability to take an holistic view of the health, safety and welfare of occupiers alongside traditional building and means of escape defects&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-22_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I doubt very much that we are talking here about the need for new qualifications. However, we shall ensure&#151;we have made a commitment on this&#151;that the rating system is implemented smoothly. To achieve that we shall ensure that there is adequate training in the system, and my officials are currently discussing with the Local Government Association and others the kind of training that will be required.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Subsection (1)(f), which Amendment No. 26 would insert into Clause 8, appears once again to be an attempt to write a regulatory impact assessment into the guidance. We do not believe that that is the function of guidance.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I am aware that some local authorities have suggested that inspections may take longer than at present. If so, we are not sure whether that reflects the complexity of the rating system or shortcuts that are taken now in the fitness inspection. What is certain is that inspections are likely to vary considerably in length, both in the field and back at base. Most dwellings, even really bad ones, will not be riddled with serious hazards. They are likely to contain one, perhaps two, although there may be less serious problems as well. Some may well require considerable attention. Surely that should not be so, if a building is to be made safe for people to occupy.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>On new subsection (1)(g), which would be inserted by the amendment, it is not clear in what circumstances authorities may need to compensate landlords. Landlords will have a right to appeal the improvement notices and prohibition orders for which the Bill provides, before they take effect&#151;or, in the case of the emergency measures, after the measures have been taken. Compensation may well be an outcome of an appeal in some such cases. I suggest that compensation should be dealt with on appeal. I cannot agree that compensation should be a matter for government guidance under Clause 8; nor can we see that compensation is a likely outcome for a landlord who has kept his tenants in conditions so hazardous that a local authority has felt compelled to take enforcement action.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>We must be sensible about this. The vast majority of landlords are good, decent property owners, providing a really good service for their tenants. Others sometimes deliberately keep tenants in hazardous conditions and ignore their complaints. Where enforcement action is taken in those circumstances, compensation should not be on the radar.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_168"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-22_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>We take far more seriously, of course, any concerns about fire safety. Fire is one of the 29 hazards dealt with by the rating system. There will be guidance on hazards from fire. It will cover the causes and preventive measures. It is not necessary to single out fire safety on the face of the Bill. All the hazards will be spelt out in the regulations which prescribe the housing health safety rating system method under Clause 2.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>We want local authorities to prioritise action against all serious hazards. In the case of houses in multiple occupation covered by Part 2, they will be required to do so following an application for a licence. I promise that we shall emphasise that in the guidance that we issue to authorities.

</p>

<a name="40720-22_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>It would be inconsistent with a system of risk assessment to prescribe specific means of dealing with hazards. However, the technical guidance to be issued under this clause will recommend that there should be adequate means of escape from fire from all parts of a building. In some houses in multiple occupation, sprinkler systems may well be required. That does not mean that authorities will require such systems in all houses in multiple occupation, but it does mean that it will be appropriate to fit them where the risk justifies it.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I hope that noble Lords will accept that the technical guidance under Clause 8 will deal comprehensively with fire and other hazards, and I believe that the elements of the amendment are either misplaced or inappropriate in the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40720-22_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>On Amendment No. 27, Clause 8 enables the appropriate national authority to give guidance to local housing authorities on the exercise of their functions under Part 1. I am certainly willing to take this amendment away. We shall, of course, lay a draft of the guidance before Parliament and we are willing to consider further whether the guidance should be made by affirmative resolution. I shall bring forward a suitable amendment to provide for that, if that is the final decision.

<a name="40720-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that very full and detailed reply. He referred to many areas covered by my series of amendments. However, he did not mention the cost at all. That needs to be assessed. He mentioned such matters as training for officers, but there will be some costs to local authorities. Local authorities will want to ascertain what the costs will be as that will be part of the bid in the revenue support grant for local authorities. We shall read the Minister&#039;s reply, and we may return to some areas later. However, perhaps the Minister could give his views on where the money will come from. The more we talk about it the more it looks as though it will cost money and that money has to come from somewhere.

money for this. I am not saying that I shall be able to do so tomorrow, but if I can give an indication of the figures tomorrow, and if it is appropriate, I shall do so. I shall be brief, as I understand that other noble Lords have not entered the Chamber to speak on the Housing Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Amendment No. 35 would enable a local authority to seek the guidance of the appropriate national authority on any of the requirements of this clause. The appropriate national authority fully intends, using its powers in Clause 8, to give comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the exercise of their functions under Part 1. I suggest, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Amendment No. 38 would appear to be intended to require the appropriate national authority to give guidance specifically on whether an undertaking, such as I have described, has been breached. Guidance will cover the full range of local authority functions, so we believe that the amendment is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>It is a massive, bold commitment on behalf of the Government. The Government are committed to meeting the local authority start-up costs. That is fairly significant. At the moment we are discussing with the Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health what costs will be covered. Our estimate at present is some &#163;5 million. That may not sound much, but we are changing the situation. Professional officers are already in place undertaking many of those functions. There is a new system and training will have to be undertaken for that   new system, but our estimate is about &#163;5 million. We are in discussion with the Local Government Association. There is a well defined procedure for new burdens on local authorities. I understand that the new burdens requirements are quite rigorously enforced so that local government is not short-changed. As I say, the present estimate is &#163;5 million.

<a name="40720-23_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I shall also be addressing the issues raised by the report of the Economic Affairs Committee on the Finance Bill 2004 and of course I shall respond to any points made on those issues in any concluding remarks.

</p>

<a name="40720-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>Since 1997, Britain has sustained growth through two economic cycles. In addition, this period of sustained growth has been combined with low inflation, low interest rates and the lowest levels of unemployment for a generation. Over 1.8 million jobs have been created, while claimant count unemployment has fallen by more than 800,000, remaining consistently below 1 million since February 2001.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>In his Budget speech in March the Chancellor of the Exchequer renewed the Government&#039;s commitment to monetary and fiscal discipline and economic stability. The Government remain on track to meet their fiscal rules over the next five years.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>The Government are also making savings on debt interest and unemployment, helping us to meet our fiscal rules, keep taxes low and spend more on vital services. These strengths mean that the Government are in a position to invest more&#151;not less&#151;in public services that matter most to the people of this country. Those areas will enable the United Kingdom to grow and prosper in the global economy of the future. The Finance Bill builds on our successes, it strengthens and modernises the economy and helps to prepare the United Kingdom for the challenges of the future.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The Government are committed to delivering world-class public services, offering opportunity for all. We will drive forward with investment in essential public services, while continuing to strengthen the United Kingdom economy, to support a fairer society with stronger communities and to promote stability and prosperity around the world.

</p>

<a name="40720-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that current spending will rise by an average of 2.5 per cent in real terms across 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. In this spending round, three-quarters of spending will go to vital front-line services. So while overall spending rises by just 2.8 per cent, departmental spending&#151;spending on vital services&#151;will have a real terms rise of 4.2 per cent over the next three years. UK education spending will rise to 5.6 per cent of GDP by 2007&#150;08 from 5.4 per cent in 2004&#150;05. We will invest more in our children to build on our improvements to the United Kingdom&#039;s education system, including a new determination to make pre-school provision for the under-fives as well as childcare available to all.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The five-year settlement announced in the 2002 Budget for health and the increased resources announced in the spending review this year mean that overall health spending will grow to &#163;92 billion in 2007&#150;08, compared <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_171"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with &#163;33 billion in 1996&#150;97. We will also continue our long-term investment in our infrastructure, particularly in transport and housing. The housing budget in England will rise from &#163;5.9 billion this year to &#163;7.2 billion by 2007&#150;08, a 4.1 per cent annual real terms rise. That will fund a major programme of investment in affordable and social housing in order to tackle the long-term under-investment and neglect of housing. That is vital to economic prosperity and our quality of life.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Spending on transport will grow on average by 4.5 per cent in real terms over the three-year period from 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. This is an ambitious programme of investment and reform that will deliver greater opportunities, expand choice and help reverse the legacy of under-investment in public services.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The Government&#039;s spending plans will help to equip Britain to meet the global challenges of the future. Productivity is the key to delivering sustained and balanced growth across the United Kingdom. In order to raise productivity levels, the Government will continue to promote competition within the economy, to support business and entrepreneurship and to raise the United Kingdom levels of skills and training.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Alongside the spending review the Government also published a 10-year investment framework for science and innovation, with the aim of making Britain the best location for science and innovation in the world. So we will not cut the science budget but increase it in average annual real terms by 5.8 per cent, a doubling of cash spending on science since 1997. We have set ourselves the ambitious target to raise overall research and development spending in both the private and public sectors from 1.9 per cent of national income to 2.5 per cent by 2014.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>The Finance Bill builds on our successes in supporting economic stability and sustained economic growth. It introduces a number of new measures to support entrepreneurship and businesses. Clauses 38 to 46 will continue the Government&#039;s reform of corporation tax, extending corporation tax relief for the expenses of managing investments to companies with investment business, providing greater certainty for companies in relation to their expenditure.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>Clauses 93 and 94 introduce further improvements to the enterprise investment scheme and the venture capital trust scheme. Clause 141 will strengthen the research and development tax credit, widening the definition of &quot;qualifying costs&quot; to include costs of computer software, water, fuel and power directly employed in research and development. Clause 142 will encourage investment by small businesses by increasing the rate for first-year capital allowances for small businesses&#039; spending on plant and machinery from 40 per cent to 50 per cent for one year.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>An important part of creating a fair society is to have a fair taxation system. The Government are determined to close down the opportunities for tax evasion and to ensure that everyone pays his fair share. The Finance Bill includes a number of measures to deliver that objective. Clauses 306 to 319 provide new disclosure obligations on promoters who market certain tax schemes, ensuring greater transparency in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_172"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the tax system and reducing the number of contrived tax schemes used to avoid tax. Clause 19 introduces a parallel disclosure measure to help counter the avoidance of indirect taxes.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>In order to discourage the self-employed from incorporating solely for tax advantages, Clause 28 introduces the non-corporate distribution rate of corporation tax, ensuring that when profits are distributed to non-company shareholders, some or all of the company&#039;s profits are charged at a minimum rate of 19 per cent, thereby protecting low rates of tax for those companies that are investing in growth.

</p>

<a name="40720-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>As a part of an enhanced strategy to combat spirits fraud, in Clause 4 the Government introduce duty stamps for spirits from 2006. Clause 84 introduces an income tax charge on previously owned assets in order to reduce unfair tax avoidance through the use of trusts.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>There has been some criticism of the length of this year&#039;s Finance Bill. Yet the Government&#039;s pension simplification proposals, which make up some 170 pages of the Bill, actually remove over 350 pages of complex legislation and sweep away nearly 1,000 pages of guidance. Clauses 149 to 284 constitute a radical simplification to one of the most complex areas of the tax system. They introduce a single set of rules for all tax   privilege pension schemes; they streamline the registration process for new pension schemes; and they allow for greater flexibility for around 15 million pension savers.
</p>

<a name="40720-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>This is a modern and progressive Finance Bill. It is realistic about the challenges this country faces in competing with the world economy. The measures to create fairness in the tax system and in the wider economy will ensure that more people will be able to benefit from our economic strengths. The Bill maintains the principles of stability and economic growth which underpin an enterprise economy that supports fairness and opportunity for all to enjoy increasing prosperity. I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="40720-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I start by thanking the Minister for introducing the Bill. We welcome the opportunity to debate the Finance Bill and the report of the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee, which considered the Bill. I pay tribute to those noble Lords on the sub-committee who produced a valuable report in the necessarily short timescale.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>The fact that your Lordships&#039; powers are limited on money matters will not diminish the relevance of our debate. We can demonstrate, as the sub-committee has demonstrated, that we have relevant expertise to contribute. I particularly look forward to the contributions of my noble and learned friend Lord   Howe and my noble friends Lord Wakeham and Lord Northbrook, not to mention that of my noble friend Lady Wilcox, who will be winding up for these Benches. I also look forward to the three maiden <br>&nbsp;<br>

speeches. We are indeed fortunate in having the noble Lords, Lord Bhattacharyya, Lord Giddens and Lord   McKenzie of Luton. I know they will agree with me in a couple of hours&#039; time that it really was not too difficult after all.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>There is a lot to debate on the Finance Bill, and I will start with the Budget from which the Finance Bill derives and the Chancellor&#039;s economic management. Last week, when we debated the spending review, I was somewhat taken aback by the criticism of the noble   Lord, Lord McIntosh, that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and I had been,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;scratching around at the margins rather than even attempting to attack the Chancellor&#039;s record&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/7/04; col.   1040.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I do not know whether the Liberal Democrats deserve that, but I put on record again our view of the Chancellor&#039;s performance. This applies to the Budget, the spending review, the Finance Bill and every interference in the economy that emanates from the Chancellor&#039;s office.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The proportion of GDP taken by public spending has been rising fast and is set to exceed 42 per cent in 2007&#150;08. Big government is not in dispute, but this Government have gone beyond big; they are fat, and that is not healthy. Last week&#039;s spending review was an admission of inefficient spending. We applaud the belated attempt at efficiency outlined in last week&#039;s statement, but we have no confidence that the head count savings will be realised, because the Chancellor has absolutely no track record in delivering any of the many reductions in civil servants that he has promised in previous years. He does have a track record of presiding over public services, which have demonstrated massive reductions in efficiency according to all studies to date, including those of No. 10 Downing Street and the Office for National Statistics. If the subjective judgments apparently favoured by this week&#039;s Atkinson report are ever allowed to gain currency, that may well allow the Government to paint a different picture in future, but we do not believe that any rational assessment of quality gains could outweigh the truly massive decline in measured efficiency over the past seven years.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>I could talk about the loss of the savings culture; the regulatory burdens on business; competitiveness; the fall in productivity growth and so on. I do not have time this evening to lay out the full charge sheet, but I do not want the Minister to be under any illusions about our view of the Chancellor&#039;s stewardship.

</p>

<a name="40720-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Last week, the Minister ducked two of the questions that I put to him on the Budget and the effect of the spending review, so I will put them to him again. First, I ask again whether the golden rule will be met over the current cycle, which runs to 2005&#150;06. The Minister replied last week on the Chancellor&#039;s sustainable investment rule, but I hope that he will be able to reply on the golden rule tonight. I hope that he will also deal with whether the golden rule will be affected by Network Rail coming on to the Government&#039;s balance sheet, as well as the effect on tax receipts of the extra pension contributions that have recently been reported.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_174"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>Secondly, I ask again:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;Will the Minister assure the House that these spending plans will be delivered without the Chancellor raising taxes or national insurance over the whole period to 2007&#150;08&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/7/04; col. 1038.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Our analysis is that he will find it difficult, if not impossible, to do so. The Minister replied last week in terms of assumptions about tax rises, but that is not what I asked. I asked for an assurance. My question has even more relevance given the refusal by the Paymaster General last week to give my right honourable friend Oliver Letwin that assurance.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>These matters of the economy and the dangers that lie within it are of greater significance than the contents of a single Finance Bill. I cannot remember ever seeing a three-volume Finance Bill. There are 637   pages&#151;328 sections and 42 schedules. A massive amount of secondary legislation is necessary to put the Bill into effect. The Minister might doubt that it is three volumes, but I have it here. That is probably a record, although I do not intend that as praise.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>I have been trying to reflect on why the Chancellor has produced these massive Finance Bills year after year. It seems to be symptomatic of a Government whose first instinct seems to be to get themselves involved in the minutiae of life in this country. This is a Government who do not content themselves with principles; they try to micromanage everything, which is why the public services have been weighed down with instructions and targets, and it is why businesses are regulated to distraction. It is why Finance Bills find more and more areas in which to intrude, and in so doing create yet more complexity and more regulatory burdens. Those are all signs of fat government.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>Our feelings about the Finance Bill are not those of anger; although I know many who are affected by the Bill feel that way. Rather, we feel the greatest sorrow that so much should be inflicted on individuals who should be left to get on with their lives, and on businesses that should be left to get on with wealth creation. My noble friend Lady Wilcox will be talking about the Government&#039;s attacks on small businesses and on the spirits industry. I shall confine my remarks to a few other areas of the Finance Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>The Finance Bill sets up massive anti-avoidance reporting requirements. Of course, they were not worked out in advance, which is why the first set of draft regulations produced universal condemnation from the practitioners who must deal with those regulations at the sharp end. We have no time for those who abuse our tax system, but these new laws run the risk of making ordinary commercial life uncertain, and compliance will be burdensome. I hope that the Government will at least take on board the entirely sensible recommendations of the Economic Affairs Committee in this regard.

</p>

<a name="40720-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The so-called simplification of the pension provisions is far from simple and was not consulted on in advance. In response to industry concerns, the Government modified some of the worst aspects during the passage of the Bill in another place, but it is undeniable that the provisions are complex, particularly in transition. The new pension rules have some undesirable features, and I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_175"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shall single out one, which is the technical rules for valuing final salary scheme pensions, which will be treated much more favourably than those for money purchase schemes. This benefits public servants in particular, and will accentuate a &quot;them and us&quot; divide, given that the effect of the Government&#039;s general policies towards pensions is to drive private sector employers into defined contribution schemes. As the CBI&#039;s pension strategy group reported earlier this week, the gap between public sector pensions, which taxpayers pay for, and other pension arrangements is causing growing resentment. The Government will come to regret that.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The 70-odd pages of the Bill devoted to stamp duty land tax tell us several things. First, they tell us that the Government introduced this new tax last year before they had worked it out properly. Secondly, they tell us that this tax will continue to be administratively burdensome and costly in compliance terms. Thirdly, they tell us that the law of unintended consequences is alive and well, and this tax has already distorted pricing in the housing market around various trigger points.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>My right honourable friends in another place fought valiantly, but unsuccessfully, to improve the Bill in various ways, including modifying the worst aspects of the pre-owned assets and trusts rules. They tried and failed to get some certainty about fuel duty in an era of volatile prices, although I note that today the Chancellor has at least conceded that the autumn hike will not be implemented. They sought, to no avail, to restore some credibility to savings by reinstating tax credits for ISAs.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The Finance Bill before us is a monument to the intruder state and produces no net benefit for the life of the country.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Finally, perhaps I may say a few words about the role of your Lordships&#039; House in scrutinising the Finance Bill. We strongly supported this innovation&#151;and I have already paid tribute to noble Lords who worked on the sub-committee&#151;but there was one very black spot: namely, the lack of full co-operation by the Treasury, which is well covered in the sub-committee&#039;s report.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>It is well known that the Chancellor does not want our House to go anywhere near his Finance Bill. It is clear that civil servants in the Treasury effectively withdrew the usual full co-operation that your Lordships&#039; House expects. It is not clear whether the Chancellor encouraged or merely allowed his civil servants to behave in this way. Either way, it is a matter of the gravest concern and really has to be sorted out.
</p>

<a name="40720-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Related to this is the Government&#039;s response to the report. I searched through the report of the Finance Bill proceedings in another place to find what the Government had to say about the sub-committee&#039;s report. I found nothing, though Members on the Benches of Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition and those of the Liberal Democrats clearly found the analysis and evidence useful. Of course we have not had a formal Government response to the sub-committee&#039;s report to consider today, and so we cannot debate it in those terms.

<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="40720-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for introducing the debate. It is a trifle bizarre because the relevant document shows that he will introduce the debate and then, on the following line, it states that I am to introduce it. I am not going to behave as if I am introducing it. I can tell noble Lords&#151;all of whom, I assume, are like me and want to go home&#151;that I have no intention of speaking a second time at the end of the debate.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Perhaps I may follow my noble friend and begin by saying a few words about the economy. In my judgment, the economy is in better shape now than I have known it in the 50-plus years that I have been a professional economist. This is a source of concern because there then follows the sad possibility that the result may well be large-scale unemployment of economists.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>But&#151;and this is not for the faint hearted&#151;it is a dangerous thing to say because the record of economists when they are optimistic is pretty poor, to the point of being disastrous. Just before the stock market collapse of 1929, one of the world&#039;s greatest economists predicted that the great crash would definitely not happen. I can give many other examples. My own favourite is that, one or two days before the 1967 devaluation, I said on the BBC that the value of the pound would definitely be maintained. So, in saying that things are good, I appreciate that this might be the end for our economy.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>In saying that the economy is in good shape, I am not remotely saying that there is no room for controversy. Speaking personally, I would favour a degree of fiscal tightening coupled with a modicum of monetary easing. But that is a technical point. I think   that most economists would agree that the Chancellor&#039;s position, the position that I have just mentioned and that of several other economists are all within what we might call the compass of reasonable discourse. I think that is a fair way of putting it.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Turning now to the report of the sub-committee on the Finance Bill, I can reassure your Lordships that we have done exactly what we were required to do. We have stayed within our terms of reference; we have not strayed into any party political wrangling; and we have impressed all interested parties but one&#151;the Treasury. Given that we have got &quot;As&quot; for everything that we have done and a &quot;C&quot; from only one body, I prefer to concentrate on all the &quot;As&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Certainly all the experts agree that our dispassionate approach, based throughout on evidence, is precisely the right way for the Finance Bill to be scrutinised. Many of them have said to me&#151;and I agree with them&#151;that it would be a welcome development if the other place adopted our approach. It might also please the Chancellor because, apart from anything else, if it did adopt our approach, our contribution might <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

become irrelevant. But I am absolutely certain in my own mind that what we did, and what your Lordships asked us to do, is the correct way to move this subject forward.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>I shall say a few words on the report itself even though, as always&#151;naively and pathetically&#151;I assume that all noble Lords who are taking part in the debate have read every word our report and the three volumes of the Finance Bill itself.

</p>

<a name="40720-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>Before I do so, however, I greatly welcome the fact that three maiden speeches are to be made in this debate. It is an honour for me to have chaired a committee which has attracted three such major figures to address your Lordships on the topic before us. Certainly this is the last time that I shall be addressing your Lordships as the chairman of the Finance Bill Sub-Committee, and it may well be the last time that I shall be addressing your Lordships as the chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee&#151;it depends on the timing of our next debate. I very much look forward to the three maiden speeches.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Turning to the report, I must, as always, thank our clerk, Robert Preston, and our two specialist advisers, Mr Leonard Beighton and Mr Brian Sheppard, who are retired senior officials of the Inland Revenue, for all their work. As opposed to the Economic Affairs Committee and other committees of your Lordships&#039; House, when we are carrying out this kind of scrutiny we rely enormously on the expertise of our advisers, as well as on external people. It is not something I feel enormously confident about without proper back-up. On the assumption that we do go ahead and make this a permanent part of our proceedings, we must find the funds to have the scale of expertise that we had this time.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Given the compressed amount of time we had available&#151;and I thank all noble Lords who took part&#151;it became a full-time job. Even then, we could look at only five topics. Last year we looked at three or four. I cannot remember why we chose the five topics; it may have been the chairman&#039;s whim. We looked at the tax and VAT avoidance schemes, about which I shall say something in a moment; and we looked at pension schemes. I was a little puzzled by the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on this issue. I know that she will have read our evidence, and overwhelmingly all the outsiders said that they thought the simplification was a simplification and that they totally approved. So I am slightly surprised at her intervention suggesting that it was not and that people did not approve; they certainly did.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>We considered the issue of small business taxation. I think the noble Baroness is right that the law of unintended consequences is working there and it was interesting to see how the relevant matters emerged. We considered stamp duty and land tax, to which I shall return; and then we came&#151;this was definitely the chairman&#039;s whim&#151;to the duty stamps for spirits, and I shall say a word on that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>If I were asked why we chose those topics and whether there were rational grounds for doing so, I suppose I could say that two or three of them were very important and the others were at least interesting. That is not bad.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_178"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Let me take a little time on the issue of tax avoidance schemes. I knew very little about the subject beforehand. I knew there were such things, but I had no idea of their scale and the appalling behaviour of major firms in our country in devising these purely artificial schemes, which bear no resemblance to the businesses concerned and what they are about. This is not a party political point, but the one thing I am absolutely certain about is that any government would wish to remove that artificiality from our tax system, if for no other reason than that the ordinary people in this country&#151;I include myself in that&#151;pay the full tax on everything they earn. To discover, as we did only the other day, that leading professional footballers of a club I support were actually paying less tax than the average wage-earner on their so-called outside earnings simply will not do. For the tax system to work, it requires the support of the general public.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>We raised the point that in trying to deal with the reporting, you could end up, in the early stages, with over-reporting. We have no doubt about that. As at least one former Chancellor will be addressing us, perhaps I may say that what tends to happen is that, on the whole, you go in blind and for a bit of overkill. I know that we are not in this business to be loved, but what struck me is that no one ever says how right we were and that they will now do as we say. Despite the fact that the Treasury will swear blind that it has not read a word of what we have said, it responds to matters of that kind. I am at least confident that although in the early stages there will be over-reporting of the registry, the system will enter an equilibrium that will work. I think that genuine people, who simply want to make sure that the system works properly in their ordinary businesses, will be reassured. So I am not worried about that, apart from in the very early stages, when there will be difficulties.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>I am certain that the Chancellor needs to go beyond just recording these artificial schemes; something needs to be done about stopping them. I think that some of my noble friends will have something to say about that.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>There are two other topics on which I want to speak briefly. I did not realise before we started that one of the problems with the stamp duty land tax was, again, tax avoidance. Partnerships were being artificially created in order to avoid paying stamp duty land tax. It is a very good example of how the bad drives out the good. Legitimate partnerships are, quite rightly, concerned that they should be correctly treated but, if people are inventing artificial partnerships as a tax avoidance device, it is not in the least surprising when the Treasury reacts by saying, &quot;We are not going to have it&quot;. There are ways in which one can distinguish the genuine from the fictitious. It is a good example of why we were right to look at this issue; most of us knew nothing about it until we did.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>On the point about spirits, my noble friend Lord   Moser, who is a great figure in the field of statistics, impressed on us the total inability to reach any agreement on the scale of the problem. We were all quite shocked by the fact that the range was not between one number and plus or minus 10 per cent&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_179"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we had a range of several hundred per cent between the least and the most. That is also illustrative of why this is worth doing. As I understand it, from what we have been told recently&#151;perhaps my noble friend the Minister will tell us more about this when he replies&#151;the Government have approached the industry and are considering a rather different way of getting into the same area without quite going down the road of enormous compliance costs. If that is happening&#151;I know that the Government would not dream of saying they were making any changes because of us&#151;that reassures me to some extent.
</p>

<a name="40720-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>I have gone slightly over time. I reiterate that I think we have done a useful job; and if we can find 12 good men and women and true for next year to put in this much effort, I very much hope that we will continue to do it. I look forward next year to sitting on the Back Benches and contributing to such a debate again.

That was underlined by Monty Finneston producing a devastating report on the engineering sector. He identified the polarisation between industry and the universities. Universities were in splendid isolation, arrogantly labouring with an antiquated curriculum. Industry did not comprehend the intellectual rigour that was needed to propel it into the new age.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>I had been giving a great deal of thought to how to develop manufacturing as an academic subject. To understand what was happening in global manufacturing, I studied the performance of manufacturing in Japan, the US and mainland Europe, and I continue to do so. Success in manufacturing involved a complex interplay of economic, technological and political factors, which were in a constant state of flux.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>Over at Warwick University there was a vice chancellor with very innovative ideas. Jack Butterworth&#151;later to become Lord Butterworth, an eminent member of the Conservative Benches&#151;was a real visionary. He knew that Warwick could be established as a leading player only by doing something different, and he invited me to join him. I had the opportunity to create a new type of centre, bringing together the best of industry and academia on a greenfield site. I was the director and the first professor of manufacturing in Britain when the Warwick Manufacturing Group was established in 1980. Looking back, that was one of the triggers that propelled Warwick University to the top level of universities.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>In fact, 1980 was not a good time to be starting a manufacturing group of any kind. British industry was in the pits. It was tough. I had very few resources and the whole idea of a university working that closely with industry was against the grain.

</p>

<a name="40720-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>Meanwhile, the first Thatcher administration grasped the nettle of tackling our industrial relations problems. Legislation quickly followed that led to the deregulation of our markets. In many parts of the country, market <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_181"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 181</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reform was very painful, but it was an essential precursor to enhancing the competitiveness of our firms. Those changes improved the environment in which companies operated, but they exposed the failings within companies. Managers had no hiding place and no more excuses about poor industrial relations. Their products had to stand or fall in the open market.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>The product of the Warwick Manufacturing Group was in great demand. We were in the thick of the reform process, working with firms big and small to improve their management and their technology. We learned about how to turn around and restructure businesses successfully, and how to raise the skill level of existing staff and create an environment where they could exploit bright young graduates.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>The first stage was to keep the firms alive. The next challenge was to make them sustainable. Sustainable success means that companies need to be open to new ideas and to generate a constant flow of new products. That requires research and development. The flow of in-company research and development had dried up, jettisoned in the struggle to survive. We realised that to restart in-company research and development, firms needed a helping hand. We created a demonstrator for the automotive sector. That gave students access to industrially relevant research and state of the art equipment and it gave firms access to a constant stream of new ideas.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>When the Prime Minister opened the Advanced Technology Centre at Warwick in January 1990, it was the first of a kind&#151;a new type of research-driven partnership between a university and industry. Today, the Warwick Manufacturing Group, which I lead, is among the largest of its kind in the world. We are proud to work with numerous firms and governments in Asia, Africa, North America and mainland Europe.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>At home, the structure of the economy has changed over the past 25 years. Today, small firms play an increasingly important role. The report that we have before us makes some very important points about the burden of tax collection on small companies. I share the views of the Select Committee when it identifies, in Chapter 4 of the report, the issues that face small firms.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>Successive Finance Bills have grown increasingly complex. Unlike individual taxpayers, small firms do not have the option of the Inland Revenue doing the calculation for them. They have to self-assess. The Inland Revenue should have a set of simple regulations, which would, of course, be bad news for accountants. I am in complete agreement with the Select Committee when it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;Finance Bills need to strike an acceptable balance between the protection of revenues and the imposition of compliance costs on the taxpayer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>Gordon Brown has done many things on the fiscal front, and not just for small businesses, to make Britain an even better place to do business. Those improvements have now developed a momentum of their own. For example, my home town of Birmingham has changed beyond recognition in the past few years. Today, the city is a place of which we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_182"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are all proud. I still cannot forget seeing the President of the United States walking along Gas Street Basin to have a pint in a canal-side pub. At one time, a canal-side walk would have revealed nothing more than an old pram and a rusty bike.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>As a past board member of the regional development agency, I have seen how regeneration lifts up areas such as the Black Country, enabling them to share in our economic success. In Coventry and Warwickshire, where Warwick University is located, we have effectively full employment for the first time in a generation.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>We do not live in a totally free-market society. In a mixed economy, improvements in education and training, science, health and infrastructure obviously require government action. We all know about the huge investments in education and health, but extra spending on science and technology, coupled with tax credits for corporate research and development, is now starting to have a major impact. I was pleased to see that commitment maintained in the Chancellor&#039;s spending review.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>Governments will always claim kudos for improvements in the economy, but it is important, too, that we have a growing sense of self-confidence and pride in our nation. We should not want to be a nation that wins a cup every now and then: we should aspire to be good at everything that we do. That must include test match cricket and, in that sport with a larger ball, taking penalties.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>Finally, I concur with noble Lords who have undertaken scrutiny of the Finance Bill. Their work has great value, and serious consideration should be given to placing the sub-committee on a permanent footing. I know that maiden speeches are meant to be non-controversial, but I think that the Government should want the House to debate and scrutinise important parts of their programme, and would help to make such a process possible. There is nothing wrong in the Treasury having that confidence.
</p>

<a name="40720-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>I commend the report to the House and look forward to participating in the important work and debates of this Chamber.

<a name="40720-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to be able to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, on an outstanding maiden speech. I do so with the knowledge that I, too, have migrated to Warwickshire, but only from Aberavon which is not quite as far as his own migration, originally from Bengal.

</p>

<a name="40720-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>There are many other reasons why I welcome his speech. He is a distinguished academic and entrepreneur, who did not disclose all the aspects of his skill as a cricketer. He is certainly a very enthusiastic cricketer. On one occasion he had the privilege of playing against Don Bradman&#039;s team in Calcutta, when they were on their way back from the United Kingdom to Australia. That is an additional, formidable achievement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>More seriously, there is his reputation for the achievements of the Warwick Manufacturing Group. I have been told that he had a desk, a chair and a secretary&#151;and nothing more than that&#151;when he started his academic career there. He has now transformed it into a business with an annual turnover of some &#163;80 million. The university owes him a great debt for that.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>Finally, I do not think that he disclosed his Brahmin origins. Brahmins are said to turn into either teachers or preachers. He seems to me to have had a marvellous blend of success in both respects. So we salute a Brahmin who is now a Brummie, who played against Bradman&#151;that is a remarkable feat. We very much look forward to hearing from him again in debates of this kind, and others, in the House.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>I have intervened, again, on a Finance Bill with some hesitation, because it is now 21 years since I have brandished a Budget box with authority and my knowledge is getting pretty rusty. I do so particularly, to follow the example of my noble friend Lady   Noakes, to welcome emphatically the report that is before us from the economics committee. It is a most important contribution to the work of the House. I like to think that, had I been in the Treasury, I should have been rather more welcoming of it than appears to be the case now. I look back with some guilt on the lack of enthusiasm that I displayed towards the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee of the other place, which was invented at about the time I went to the Treasury. So we have to have some sympathy with the Chancellor, but he will get used to this committee. I certainly hope that we shall renew it when this one finishes its term, particularly because the style, which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, commended, is exactly the kind of style with which Parliament of both Houses should be considering legislation of this kind and, indeed, many other issues. I admire the extent to which my right honourable friend in the other place, Oliver Letwin, manages to achieve that style.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>We live in a society where there is now a very large degree of common ground between the parties. Many of the reforms enacted by the Thatcher government which were denounced at the time have been accepted as the foundation for the work of this Government. There is a great deal of common ground, and one of the oddities is that, as a response, the major parties have indulged in excessive product differentiation of a striking kind. That is not the right way in which to consider the sort of issues that we are considering today.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I am glad, therefore, that the Chancellor has done so much to build on the foundations which we laid, but am worried at the extent to which he seeks to erode them. I must list some shortcomings about his performance to which one must draw attention. My noble friend Lady Noakes spoke of the &quot;fat government&quot;. That is carrying the metaphor a shade further than &quot;big government&quot;. The Chancellor undoubtedly demonstrates a tendency towards obesity, both of paper consumed and language deployed. I am struck by the fact that my first Financial Statement and Budget Report&#151;the Red <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_184"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Book, as it was then known&#151;contained only 33 pages, was for sale at the cost of &#163;1.25, and weighed only 68 grams. However, the latest Financial Statement and Budget Report costs &#163;45, contains 296 pages and weights 1.12   kilos. That is obesity on a substantial scale in terms of paper generated. The public spending review has been transformed in a similar way.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>I turn to the scale of Finance Bills&#151;the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will have heard this argument previously. I pleaded guilty to an average of 98 sections and 15 schedules and my pages were on average just short of 100. However, the Chancellor&#039;s average is 141 sections but he has far exceeded that this time. His   average is 30 schedules but this time he has 42   schedules. His obesity tendencies are expansive and continuing.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>The Minister succeeded in giving the Chancellor a legitimate alibi in relation to pension simplifications. One must acknowledge that that is a step in the right direction, although there is no doubt that it is less than perfect. I also acknowledge that there is a real need to continue to tackle the problem of tax evasion, which is the most elusive topic. He was right to try to tackle that, although I shall return to it in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>One final mitigation is that when we were in the Treasury, we succeeded in repealing certain taxes, such as capital transfer tax, development land tax, investment income surcharge and national income surcharge. We are well rid of those taxes.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>Another demonstration of obesity is the hugely self-praising style of the language in all that the Treasury produces. The chapter headings of the spending review are all written in the most self-congratulatory fashion: &quot;Stability, security and opportunity for all&quot;, &quot;Efficiency&quot;, &quot;Better public services&quot;, &quot;A stronger, more productive economy&quot;, &quot;A fairer society with stronger communities&quot;, and &quot;Global security and prosperity&quot;. Heaven on Earth! The final capping for the dossier&#151;inevitable these days&#151;is an immensely fulsome foreword by the Prime Minister, which really should be avoided. The language and style are much too full of such self-congratulatory content.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>To become rather more serious&#151;these are serious points&#151;the Chancellor no doubt will have noted in the magazine <i>Prospect</i> that he was selected as one of the 100 most intellectual people in this country. I hope that he will also have noticed the comments by one of his colleagues in that league, Samuel Brittan, who said in the <i>Financial Times</i> last week that the Chancellor&#039;s insights were,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;delivered in an unappetising mixture of Labour-speak and management consultant jargon. They have no grace or magnanimity towards predecessors, but assume that the world began in 1997. Then there is the continuing misuse of the word &#039;investment&#039; to describe&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>any form of public expenditure. He continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;I wish somebody would tell the chancellor . . .  that self-praise has a bad odour&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>That is a fair judgment on the style with which the Chancellor has approached many of these matters.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>Apart from the volume of legislation, I commend the move towards simplification in the pensions field. That is in line with the task that I have been carrying <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_185"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on, thanks to the Chancellor; that is, the tax law rewrite project. I very much welcome his continued commitment to that. I am, however, sad that he is not prepared to take it further by responding more positively to the proposals of the Budd committee of the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year to establish a tax structure review project directed to examine the shape of taxation, quite apart from the language of it. That is the kind of work that could be carried forward successfully if we were allowed to maintain our economics committee in this House. Better still, that committee could work in partnership with the comparable committee in another place.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>I draw attention to one aspect of the Bill on which the committee focused; namely, Clause 28 and Schedule 3, which involve the corporation tax zero rate. The Chancellor has allowed that to survive for only 12 months. A large amount of the material is there directed to try to repeal that mistaken attempt to shape the economy with the encouragement of smaller corporations. If the Chancellor is to produce proposals of that kind, it surely makes more sense to consult about them more fully, otherwise to resist the temptation. The committee quite rightly concluded that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;the government, by its rhetoric, (including the reference to incorporation being undertaken &#039;often as a result of marketed tax avoidance schemes&#039;) presented the proposals as a part of the anti-avoidance strategy.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>The committee goes on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;We understood the argument of the private sector that the mischief to which the measure was directed was actually no more than a natural reaction to a tax incentive, which had been deliberately introduced.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>That is illustrative of the kind of mistake that can follow from over enthusiasm.
</p>

<a name="40720-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>I hope to summarise my message to the Chancellor from now on. It will be the same as my message to both major political parties and indeed to the Liberal Democrat Party. It is a six-word election manifesto which I would like to see us all fighting in the next election: For God&#039;s sake leave us alone!

I am pleased that my noble friend and his colleagues have proved themselves to be unsqueamish, at least as far as tax regulation is concerned. I should like to congratulate them on their report, which contains a great deal of value.

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>Nothing divides political opinion more than the level of taxation appropriate to a society. However, the passions roused by this issue could direct attention away from other aspects of taxation which are just as significant. Indeed, I would make the case that a new approach to taxation, or, more accurately, to its implications for behaviour, is one of the distinguishing features of the progressive approach to politics that I represent and to which I have tried to contribute. Unlike the traditional Left, a modern, progressive approach&#151;the third way, if you like&#151;is concerned in a central fashion with economic dynamism and job creation.

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Unlike the traditional Left, such an approach emphasises the fostering of an enterprise culture, entrepreneurism and risk-taking. We need risk-takers not only among those who run businesses, but also in the labour force because of the need to respond to high levels of technological change. Unlike the Right, however, a progressive approach regards social protection and social justice as not only compatible with these emphases, but as inherent in them.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>When appropriately structured, taxation plays a key role in pursuing such objectives. Taxation and different tax regimes can have a crucial impact on economic dynamism and on social citizenship. We should always be seeking to structure the tax system in such a way as to maximise wider economic and social benefits.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>In recent years, we have seen how successful such an approach can be. For instance, tax credits such as the working families&#039; tax credit have simultaneously helped to promote entry to jobs and to alleviate poverty. Micro-credit has been deployed with great success, to allow people without financial resources to start their own businesses. Fiscal incentives have been used in conjunction with venture capital to encourage small-business start-ups in poor areas. As a consequence, as my noble friend remarked, we have an economy that is strong and stable, yet in which there is increasing investment in public services, along with reductions in levels of poverty.

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>Enterprise must go along with citizenship, however. The report has an important section on tax avoidance, especially the problem of dealing with what are called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;sophisticated and aggressive tax avoidance schemes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>Abusive tax avoidance is an issue of core importance today, on a national as well as an international level. Tax-avoidance schemes currently cost the Treasury &#163;13 billion a year in lost income, money that could and should be spent for public purposes. It is good to see new steps being introduced to counter the effects of the tax-avoidance industry. Many of those in that industry, in reacting to the Bill, claim that proposals for the prior disclosure of tax-avoidance schemes add to an already demanding framework of legislation. Parallel legislation in place in the US, however, has already led to the closing of 29 types of abusive tax shelter.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>Of course there will always be tussles between the promoters of tax planning and the revenue services, but we should not accept the idea that individuals or companies will seek by hook or by crook to escape paying as much tax as they can. We want more entrepreneurs, yet we should expect and ensure that they behave as responsible citizens. Aggressive tax-avoidance schemes are of a piece with a decline in ethical standards that has afflicted major areas of business in recent years, with results about which we all know. Enron had 881 offshore subsidiaries and paid no taxes at all in the US during four of its last five years. Anyone who paid one dollar of taxation in that time was paying more than a corporation ranked high in the <i>Fortune </i>500.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>Abusive tax avoidance is by definition not illegal, but its consequences for public life and business ethics are as far-reaching as practices that are. Franklin Roosevelt&#039;s economic adviser, Henry Morgenthau, once pointed out that if taxes are the hallmark of a civilised society, as I believe that they are,

For the first time ever in our memory, people assume that stability will continue for ever. Once people make that kind of assumption, which is a novel one that has never been made before, they feel secure. Even if their income varies a bit, they feel that there will be stability every year.

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Turning to the work of the Select Committee, last year a committee of the House of the Lords reported on the Finance Bill for the first time, and we carried out a similar task this year. We had to consider the technical aspects of tax&#151;clarification and administration&#151;but not of course the rates or instance of taxation, which are matters for the House of Commons. We understand that. Our particular advantage has been that we have Members with considerable experience and expertise. They have occupied positions of relevance and so they have a sense of perspective. That is what gives them something extra compared with the House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>This means that the House of Lords can make a useful contribution to the debate. That is shown by the unanimity of the committee, which extended to all its decisions. We do not have the same responsibility as the House of Commons, but the views of our committee should be of some use. The House of Commons finally decides the matters in the Bill, but some input from here can be welcomed. Now that the hereditary Peers have been reduced in number, the House of Lords cannot be assumed to be just another interest group. Our work has been to examine whether the legislation can be as effective as one would wish, not to pursue any particular aims of our own.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>The House and the committee will be sorry that my noble friend Lord Barnett is not here to take part in this debate. He is making slow progress in recovering from his fall nine weeks ago in this Chamber, and I am sure that the House will wish him an early recovery. His contribution to the work of the committee has been valuable.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The task of the committee was to ensure that the Finance Bill measures prove workable and effective when implemented. We sought to answer the question, &quot;Will they protect revenues without imposing disproportionate compliance costs on taxpayers and their advisers?&quot;. Once again, we had to be selective as to the topics that we chose. We examined them and decided to focus our efforts on a few areas which we thought were causing particular concern and where we thought our efforts might be most valuable. We had limited time in which to make such decisions, because they can come only after the publication of the Finance Bill.

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>The areas that we dealt with included countering tax avoidance, simplification of the taxation of pensions, small business taxation, stamp duty, land tax and duty stamps for spirits. Concerning the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes, we noted the view of many of our private sector witnesses that the definitions of tax planning arrangements are so wide as to require the disclosure of normal tax planning as well as of the sophisticated and aggressive avoidance schemes to which my noble friend Lord Peston rightly referred.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>Those schemes have expanded and they must be dealt with. It is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with the machinations of people who get substantial sums of money out of their efforts in this area. The way that the Bill targets such measures can lead to a significant risk of over-reporting, with a need for updated draft regulations to be introduced as the schemes develop. We trust that the concerns that we expressed in our report will be taken into account.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The problem of over-reporting arises when people feel that to be on the safe side they had better report almost everything. Were they to do so, it would place an enormous burden on the Revenue, which could not cope with that amount of information. We wanted the adoption of a de minimis rule in the direct tax provisions on broadly similar lines to those in the draft VAT regulations and comparable United States tax law. We took evidence from the United States Internal Revenue Service, which was helpful.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>We also considered that there were good grounds for looking again at the appropriateness of the five-day time limit for filing details of certain notifiable tax arrangements. Five days is not enough; the advisers need more time than that. We suggested an extension to 30 days. Preparing a case of such importance demands a longer period than was envisaged. We recommended that the draft regulations relating to the disclosure of direct tax avoidance arrangements should, in line with the regulations for VAT avoidance schemes, be made subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>The spirits industry particularly interested me. The Treasury concern about fraud in the spirits industry is a matter of obvious interest. The solution set out is for duty stamps for spirits to be introduced in 2006. There was a need for considerable consultation on the matter. That is something that rather saddens me about the whole Finance Bill: there should be wider consultation. I understand that there are certain areas in which it is not possible to have consultation because people will take avoidance measures, but there are areas where we can. Where we can, we must&#151;that is the message that we should send out.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>The problem was the cost of compliance with the measure which represented&#151;and still represents&#151;a considerable burden. Whether the cost of compliance is reasonable depends on the extent of the fraud. If the fraud is greater, compliance costs can be expected to increase.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>In that context, we were particularly disturbed at the statistical range in the Government&#039;s figures. What kind of value was set on the fraud that we were trying to deal with? Customs and Excise estimated the fraud at &#163;600 million a year and on an upward trend. The National Audit Office examined the figures given by Customs and Excise and suggested that the amount should be expressed as ranging between &#163;330 million and &#163;1,060 million. The Joint Alcohol and Tobacco Consultation Group widened the range to between &#163;10   million and &#163;1,060 million. We cannot deal with taxation if we have figures as wide apart as that. If the agencies cannot get the figures, they must consult more and investigate more. On the other hand, we could have such a minimal tax that it would not make too much difference and then increase it as we became more aware of the amount of fraud involved.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>Whatever the estimates, one cannot engage in anything other than minimal compliance costs without a more definite assessment of the amount of fraud. It will be essential to narrow the differences between those estimates. The outcome should be reflected in the continuing discussions with the industry on the implementation of the provisions. I do not know why the consultation could not go on until a solution is reached that could be put before us.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>We hoped that the consultations would result in an outcome that properly reflected the interests of the smaller producers and importers, particularly as it is they who would suffer most. They have real concerns that their livelihood could be put at risk. In such matters, legislation should be in draft, and a two-way dialogue with those involved should be arranged at the outset.
</p>

<a name="40720-28_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>We have had two years of making a contribution to work on the Finance Bill. Obviously, we respect the position of the House of Commons on taxation. We do not go beyond our remit, but we feel that through the efforts of the committee we can be of help in achieving a better Finance Bill.

I look forward to hearing them speak in future on financial matters. I also look forward to hearing the third maiden speaker, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, in due course. I declare an interest as director of a fund management company set up in 1996.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>Once again, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord   Peston, and his committee for the splendid, detailed work that they have done in producing their report on this year&#039;s Finance Bill. How well they made use of the little more time available this year.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>I would like to endorse in particular three of their comments in the abstract at the front of the report. The first, which I have made frequently in the past and which was made by my noble friend Lady Noakes and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

my noble and learned friend Lord Howe, was about the length of the three-volume Finance Bill. In the committee&#039;s words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;We noted the length of the Finance Bill and the increase in complexity and compliance costs for taxpayers and their advisers inherent in many of its provisions. One means by which a balance between the protection of revenues and the imposition of compliance costs may be found is, wherever possible, by exposing legislation in draft and encouraging a two way dialogue with those involved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>I agree entirely.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>The second comment that I endorse, also discussed by my noble friend Lady Noakes, is the committee&#039;s reservation about the lack of assistance from the Treasury. When it wished to see the Treasury a second time to give officials the opportunity to respond to the points put to them after their initial explanations, the Treasury would respond only in writing. According to the report they did not give substantive answers to several questions.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>Will the Minister use his best endeavours to persuade the Treasury in future to give a second face-to-face meeting that might even save it time in responding to the committee?
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>Thirdly, along with other noble Lords I endorse the recommendation in the final paragraph of the abstract that the sub-committee should be made permanent, although, sadly, if agreed it would no longer be chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Peston. I speak for all noble Lords interested in financial matters when I thank him for all his work in chairing the committee.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>I wish to focus on two areas of detail in the Bill. One is covered in detail in the Select Committee&#039;s report and the other is not. The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I am focusing on small business taxation, as I have raised the topic before in the House. For those unfamiliar with the topic, the story goes as follows: since 1997 the Chancellor has encouraged the incorporation of businesses through lowering the rate of small companies&#039; tax from 23 per cent to 20 per cent, in 1999 creating a starting rate of 10 per cent.

</p>

<a name="40720-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>Edward Troup, tax adviser at Simmons & Simmons, told the Treasury Select Committee in April   1999 that if we offered a tax rate of 10 per cent, every self-employed person would think seriously about whether he would be better off incorporated to save tax. The tax system is moving in a significant skew towards incorporation. In 2002, the starting rate was lowered to zero. John Whiting of the accountants PwC said in April 2002 that incorporation was something that taxpayers should have been thinking about, but the Budget had given it an extra spin down the income scale. That point has been proved by the figures for new incorporations. In 2002&#150;03, 322,000 new incorporations took place; an increase of 43   per cent over 2001&#150;02.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The next stage in the saga was the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003 which surprisingly recorded the Government&#039;s concern that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;the longstanding differences in tax treatment between earned income and dividend income should not distort business strategies, or enable reductions by tax planning of individuals&#039; tax liability, and that support should continue to be focussed on growth&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_192"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>They therefore announced proposals for action in the Budget of 2004,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid by owner managers of small incorporated businesses on the profits extracted from their company&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>This statement has come to be known as IR591.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>One of the most interesting statements on this volte-face came from Malcolm Gunn, the editor of the independent journal, <i>Taxation</i>, who argued in a letter to the Chancellor in January 2004 that the comments in paragraph 5.91 had been met with some astonishment and that the very corporate tax regime which the Chancellor carefully constructed was now described in the pre-Budget review as one which distorts business strategies and enables reductions by tax planning of individuals&#039; tax liability.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>I can only echo the words of the shadow Chief Secretary in another place, who said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;The Government failed to heed warnings given at the time by everyone, including the official Opposition, that they were distorting the tax system in favour of incorporation. Unsurprisingly, the tax loss when thousands of sole traders incorporated has turned out to be far too great, so a piece of tax complexity is required to negate that&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 7/7/04; col. 862.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>Or let us take the words of the Select Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, which, in paragraph 154, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;We have to say that we understood the argument of the private sector that, in a sense, the mischief to which the measure was directed was actually no more than a natural reaction to a tax incentive which had been deliberately introduced: and that on the spectrum of tax planning it tended towards the &#039;normal&#039; end, albeit because of the multiplier effect, expensive in terms of revenue foregone&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>In addition, the committee has serious concerns about the application of the new measure. In paragraph 144 the report said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;We are disturbed that, so far, the Revenue have been unable to persuade the experts who gave evidence to us that applying the new measure will be as straightforward as they have confidently asserted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>The paragraph goes on to state that in one of the issues the Revenue&#039;s reply,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;underestimates the extent of the anxiety caused to affected taxpayers and to their professional advisers during the weeks of uncertainty that followed publication of paragraph 5.91&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>My final comment on this subject is well summarised in paragraph 153 of the committee&#039;s report. Private witnesses perceived this provision as an administrative measure on which they would have had much to contribute had it been thrown open to a two-way dialogue rather than a one-way listening exercise by the Revenue. On the other hand, by their rhetoric, which included the reference to incorporation being undertaken often as a result of &quot;marketed tax avoidance schemes&quot;, the Government presented the proposals as part of the avoidance strategy at the heart of this year&#039;s Finance Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>The other area upon which I wish to focus is the individual savings account. The Government introduced ISAs in April 1999 to increase the number of people with savings. Yet the limit they allowed of &#163;7,000 per year was more than 35 per cent lower than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_193"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 193</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the previous administration. By 1997 savers were able to take out general and single company PEPs amounting to &#163;9,000 each year and a TESSA of effectively &#163;1,800 per year. The ISA allowance was also made more complex with maxi and mini ISAs being introduced. However, overall it was more than could have been expected from previous Labour Governments.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>Two measures have been announced to restrict the benefits of ISAs. First, for the equity ISA since 6 April this year investment managers may no longer reclaim the 10 per cent tax credit on dividend income. This acts to reduce the attractiveness of equity investments within ISAs to basic rate taxpayers. As the shadow Paymaster General at the time said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;The equity ISA tax credit does benefit the many not the few which is the point of the argument about seeking to retain the 10 per cent&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 1/7/03; col. 212.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>In addition the Chancellor has confirmed that the annual limit for ISAs will be reduced by another 20 per cent to &#163;5,000 with effect from April 2006.
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>The Government have urged people to save and to make adequate provision for their retirement, admitting that the basic pension is not enough. ISAs should be at the centre of their strategy to encourage long-term savings. This is not the time to undermine them. Pensioners have already been hit by the ACT abolition, which has deprived pension funds of &#163;5 billion a year. Now the Government will take in an extra &#163;250 million per year by getting rid of the tax credits. How much of a tax break will be saved by cutting the ISA limit from &#163;7,000 to &#163;5,000?
</p>

<a name="40720-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>The Government are not sending a good signal about encouraging savings by those two measures. That is reflected in the decline in the savings ratio since 1997. In the years from 1998 to 2003 the household savings ratio has never been higher than 6.7 per cent. In the previous six years to 1997 it was never lower than 9.3 per cent. In March, the shadow Chancellor said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;If the Government do not do something to improve incentives to save, the stability of the economy will be threatened by excessive debt&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-29_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>In summary, I believe that those two areas of the Budget send out the wrong message to small businesses and savers respectively, both of which are important for the economic health of the country in their different ways.

</p>

<a name="40720-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>It is a pity that your Lordships&#039; House is inhibited from debating and scrutinising the nation&#039;s finances. In recent years your Lordships have been able to be complimentary about the work of the Treasury, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury team. As my noble friend Lord McIntosh reminds us whenever he has the opportunity, inflation is low, interest rates are low, and we are spending far less money on debt interest and unemployment pay. He reminded us about that again this evening.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>I understand that the Parliament Act restrains us from amending the Finance Bill, but it does not preclude us from scrutinising it. I am well aware that there is a difference of opinion between the Treasury and your Lordships&#039; House about where the line is drawn. I was interested to learn that the Select Committee had decided to look at tax avoidance as part of its scrutiny of the Finance Bill&#151;and quite rightly. The committee looked at the mechanics of tax avoidance, not at the tax rates.

</p>

<a name="40720-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>I noted that the Revenue has accepted some of the Select Committee&#039;s recommendations. Those are recommendations that would save the Inland Revenue from being swamped with useless information. The Revenue would thereby get better-focused information about those various schemes. Unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I found myself in almost entire agreement with Ministers and with the committee in their determination to protect the vast majority of compliant taxpayers and the integrity of the system by supporting the Government&#039;s efforts to stop avoidance and evasion.

</p>

<a name="40720-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>I agree with my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Giddens that for taxpayers to be compliant they have to perceive the system as fair. As the Minister explained, part of that requires providers of artificial tax planning schemes to report them to the Treasury. I welcome a disclosure regime that requires accountants, bankers and lawyers to provide details to the Government of tax avoidance schemes that they sell to clients. The committee spent some time differentiating between ordinary tax planning and artificial schemes. So it must have been with some disappointment that they learned last week that a scheme&#151;the relevant discount securities scheme&#151;which the Revenue shut down a year ago as artificial, was allowed by the special commissioners. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, spoke of the practitioners being taken by surprise by the regulations. I imagine that they were taken even more by surprise by this allowance by the special commissioners.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>I realise that the Minister cannot comment on that, as there could be an appeal, but it indicates how difficult it is to legislate against tax avoidance. As I understand it, a scheme such as this one uses artificial contrivances, to use the Minister&#039;s words, within the United Kingdom. Other schemes contrive to use our globalised economy to avoid tax, even though there is no commercial loss. In addition, there is the whole issue of using domicile to avoid paying tax. The possibilities are worldwide, way beyond the resources of the Inland Revenue alone to regulate, to manage and to control in a proportionate way.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_195"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>In view of that and the expansion about which my noble friend Lord Sheldon spoke, it occurs to me that perhaps the Select Committee should have considered other measures; for example, a cultural change as well as a regulatory change. Before your Lordships dismiss that, with a world-weary sigh, perhaps I can remind your Lordships that cultural changes are taking place before our very eyes&#151;in government, in the Treasury and in business. Take charitable giving. The Inland Revenue and the Treasury are encouraging a cultural change. They are encouraging the giving campaign. They are offering more tax breaks to encourage charitable donations and setting higher targets for aid to the third world. If that is not an effort to encourage a cultural change in charitable giving, what is it?
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>What about the cultural change taking place within business itself? Not a week passes without some encouragement to business to become more socially responsible. I am sure that noble Lords&#039; mailbags are full of invitations to conferences, meetings, discussions and seminars about corporate social responsibility. Mine is. I am aware that many think that that is just another soft issue that gets in the way of increasing shareholder value&#151;it is a nuisance. But possibly an equal number now think that that is central to the confidence and trust that people have in a company&#039;s products, services or brand.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>The recent corporate scandals in Europe and the United States have encouraged that cultural change. Several surveys show that most managers feel that corporate ethics is an important or an emerging issue for their businesses. Indeed, there are now several awards for the integrity of social and environmental reporting. In May 2003 the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s Forum for the Future, reported that a business with strong social responsibility will often be more successful in generating economic value added for reasons rooted in business strategy. Is that not the Government encouraging cultural change? Business leaders themselves are calling for that. Last week, in an article in the <i>Guardian</i>, entitled &quot;Capitalism is a danger to itself&quot;, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild called for a new emphasis on ethics from inside corporate boardrooms as an alternative to more public oversight, which he found less desirable. He said that that was especially so in the financial services sector.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>I think that all those matters are signals of cultural change in business and in government and a cultural change that does not question the legality but questions the ethics of business activities. My question is whether the Treasury and your Lordships&#039; committee would consider tax avoidance as socially irresponsible when the culture is moving strongly towards social responsibility in business. After all, what could be more socially responsible than paying one&#039;s taxes in a fair way?
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>Perhaps the scene is already being set. The Inland Revenue itself is becoming much more open about tax. The Government have quite rightly introduced the pre-Budget report so that the Chancellor can flag up tax changes so that they can be discussed. The Treasury trusts the public not to take undue advantage of that opportunity for consultation and discussion so <br>&nbsp;<br>

that there is every opportunity to get the practical issues ironed out. Indeed, your Lordships&#039; Select Committee drew attention to this in its report about small companies and dividends.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>So, where do we go from here? Many of these tax avoidance schemes, for small companies, for large companies, for personal tax, for VAT and for income tax are marketed by what are called &quot;business service companies&quot;. Tax advice is a growth business. However, most of these companies also offer advice and consultancy to the public and private sectors on corporate social responsibility&#151;on business in the community. They advise on preparing a social set of accounts as well as financial accounts.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>Of course, however widely one interprets the purpose of business, the making of money has to be there somewhere. But these business services companies are in a privileged position. They can afford to be a little more forceful about the ethical responsibility that goes with the privilege. A cultural change here would certainly assist with protecting the integrity of our tax system. So I ask the Minister: why not have a go?

I should also like to place on record my thanks to all the staff and officials for their courtesy and assistance in helping me to understand the procedures and facilities of this House.

</p>

<a name="40720-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>My professional life, mostly spent with Price Waterhouse, has given me the opportunity to live and work in several different countries, from one of the richest, the US, to perhaps one of the poorest, Vietnam; from a highly sophisticated market-driven economy to an emerging market economy with still a very rudimentary legal and commercial infrastructure. But each in its way facing the challenges of operating&#151;for them&#151;appropriate tax regimes and safeguarding the revenues they determine should be collected.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>Hence I turn to the matter before this House. I would like to speak on the provisions in the Finance Bill requiring disclosure of tax avoidance schemes, especially those relating to direct taxes. As other noble Lords have indicated, this was clearly one of the key topics examined by the Select Committee on Economic Affairs. That the Bill includes such provisions is something I welcome.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>While the Select Committee was properly concerned with seeking to be satisfied that the primary legislation and related regulations were workable and effective, its unequivocal endorsement of the disclosure approach is to be commended. The regulations in their final form are a sensible advance on the original drafts and validate the process of dialogue.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>If anyone has any doubts about the appropriateness of this legislation, they need do no more than read the evidence given by the deputy chairman of the Inland Revenue, to which my noble friend Lord Peston referred earlier. The deputy chairman described the proposals as &quot;proportionate&quot;. That is certainly not an overstatement of the case. Examples were provided of the kind of artificial, aggressive, tax avoidance schemes that these disclosure requirements would help to counter. For just two schemes, the &quot;gilt strip&quot; and the so-called &quot;tax efficient off-market swap&quot;, he estimated that as much as &#163;1.2 billion could have been lost to the Exchequer.

</p>

<a name="40720-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>Of course, the disclosure requirements do not of themselves make anything taxable. They give the Revenue authorities early warning and fair notice of what might otherwise be marketed in secrecy, and what might otherwise take years for them to discover and seek to counter. It will also deter some from buying into these schemes. The disclosure requirements, however modest, represent an additional weapon in the armoury of the Revenue authorities and will help, at least to an extent, to adjust what is undoubtedly not a level playing field.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>That is not because of some intellectual deficit on behalf of the Revenue; it is just that some taxpayers and their advisers are able to marshal a range of resources and expertise, which is difficult for any taxing authority to replicate. This situation is not unique to the UK. The major accounting and legal practices&#151;big firms certainly, although I am not sure whether they would like to be described as fat&#151;have at their disposal individuals with expert knowledge of all the world&#039;s major tax and legal systems. They can call on industry knowledge in all key sectors. They can <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

access specialist knowledge on sophisticated financial instruments and have developed a significant capacity to unbundle and recast those to obtain tax advantages.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>I was interested to read the reference in the Revenue evidence to the proposed avoidance intelligence group, which will, I hope, act as some counterweight to all of this. The challenge that it faces is formidable; I wish it well.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>The Select Committee report distinguished between the contrived artificial tax avoidance schemes, which it recognised as being the extreme of the spectrum of tax planning, and ordinary tax planning arrangements. That raises the question of where the ordinary stops and the extraordinary begins. Where should that line be drawn? That is a conundrum with which I have wrestled from time to time. It would not be unreasonable for the line to be where those in another place with responsibility to determine these matters would have intended it to rest, had they had the opportunity of reviewing the full combination of circumstances and arrangements that might have been entered into.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>But for so long as the UK tax system remains largely, if not exclusively, based on form over substance, that alignment of what the law actually provides with what was intended will continue to take place generally in retrospect by way of detailed anti-avoidance legislation, with consequent losses to the Exchequer in the interim. These disclosure requirements will provide some opportunity to make this alignment sooner and more precisely than might have otherwise been the case. It is important that the opportunity leads to action. In this regard, and in the absence of a general anti-avoidance provision, it is a necessary measure. It remains to be seen whether it is ultimately a sufficient measure.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>I am aware that matters of supply are dealt with in another place, but as these disclosure measures will help to protect revenues, perhaps I might take the opportunity to express the hope that we will continue to see in Luton the significant levels of investment in our schools, health facilities and the regeneration of our town, including its transport infrastructure, from which we have benefited since 1997.
</p>

<a name="40720-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Finally, perhaps I may say that I have enjoyed every moment of my time here so far. If our deliberations touch the lives of people in a positive way, this is an endeavour of which I am happy to be part.

<a name="40720-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wakeham: </b>   My Lords, when I came to the debate this evening I thought that probably the pleasures of my day were more or less over. I have spent the past two days congratulating graduating students at Brunel University and I have shaken more than 2,000 hands; there are another 1,000 to go tomorrow. However, I was wrong; this has been an excellent debate. Any debate which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, opens and closes will be, by definition, a quality debate.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>We have heard three outstanding maiden speeches, which we have all enjoyed. As a former chairman of the Royal Commission on the reform of this House, I <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cannot imagine another legislature in the world that could produce new members of the quality of the three new Members we have heard this evening. It is something that those who may be taking up the issue in the years to come will perhaps think about.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>This House produces first-rate speeches and it is my particular pleasure, of course, to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, on his excellent maiden speech. I have no doubt that he will speak on many subjects. If he continues to speak with the clarity, the sincerity and the obvious knowledge that he has, he will be a welcome addition to your Lordships&#039; House. He has a lot going for him. He is a chartered accountant&#151;that cannot be too bad to start off with&#151;and he is from Luton. I have a kind of connection with Luton in the sense that my father was the last general manager of Vauxhall Motors before it was owned by General Motors. We have to go back a long way&#151;it was not too long after the First World War that that happened&#151;and I remember in 1939 going back to Luton when my father was recalled to the army as a former territorial, the war starting and my father taking the salute. He did not have a uniform even, and he was there raising his flat cap as the troops marched past. I was a small boy standing nearby. So I have the greatest affection for anyone who comes from Luton. Of course, the radio doctor, who was a distinguished member of our party, was the Member for Luton at one time, but that is also a long time ago.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>I also know&#151;I shall not pursue this further&#151;that the noble Lord worked in Vietnam in his youth. I have also worked in Vietnam. I suggest that perhaps we ought to reminisce over a drink in the bar rather than mention it here today.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>I am a Member of the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Select Committee and I wish to concentrate on our report. A number of noble Lords have already said that they think the experiment was a success; that we have done a good job; that we have not conflicted with our terms of reference and so on. They have also said&#151;which I was certainly going to say&#151;that a great deal of that credit is due to the noble Lord, Lord Peston. He has been an outstandingly good chairman. If I may say so, he has a rather individual style of chairing a Select Committee, but he has a very successful way of getting the best out of everyone on the committee. I have enjoyed being with him. The only time when he is not very convincing is when he says that he does not know anything about the subject. He did not fool most Members of the committee with those kind of remarks. Nevertheless, it was a great pleasure to serve on the committee with him.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>If there was any cause for our success in writing the report, other than the noble Lord, Lord Peston, next on the list would be the quality of the evidence given to us. I thought that the government officials who gave us evidence were absolutely first class. They made a powerful case for the changes, but also showed the depth of study that had gone into the subject before they had given the advice to Ministers which had resulted in the changes we were considering. Knowing that was a comfort to all of us.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_200"></a>

</p>

<a name="40720-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>It reminded me of when I was a junior Minister in the Treasury, under my noble and learned friend Lord   Howe, who has already spoken. We were very concerned at the inward-looking nature of the Inland Revenue in those days, and we tried to get a non-executive element into it so that it would grow up a bit more aware of what was going on rather than being so concentrated. I think that the changes that have occurred in the past 20 years or so have resulted in a stronger, better and more knowledgeable Inland Revenue. I am saying that because not everything I say about it will be nice.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>The outside witnesses were also very expert and excellent. If I had a criticism, it was that I sometimes felt that some of the witnesses understood the problem that the Government had but were unwilling to accept the remedies that they were proposing or to offer any alternatives. However, mostly they were excellent.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>I think that our work was valuable&#151;we worked jolly hard to complete our report before the Finance Bill left the Commons. I confirm what has already been said&#151;at no time in our work did party politics play a part. If anybody had tried to make party political points in the committee, he would have had short shrift from his colleagues. Nor did we stray from our terms of reference, steering clear of rates of tax or their incidence.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>Four of the five clauses that we examined were designed to protect the Revenue, and the fifth was designed to simplify the tax position of pensions. We had no difficulty with any of the Government&#039;s objectives, and we believe that they deserve credit for tackling them.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>However, all those clauses raised a fundamental question that goes right to the heart of taxation policy in this country. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, touched on this in his speech, and so did one or two others. How complicated do we make our tax laws to make sure that we catch every last penny of every bit of tax from everybody who might be tempted to take some sort of unfair advantage at the expense of putting the rest of the taxpayers under an intolerable burden of complication? Getting that balance right is at the heart of what officials have to advise and what Ministers have to do.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>My experience, over many years, has been that the tendency in the Inland Revenue has been to want to get the tax system absolutely fair. As a result, it has at times been more complicated than perhaps it needed to be because of this desperate concern, which I admire, to get taxation.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>We were impressed with the evidence on the Government&#039;s improvements to the taxation of pensions. We felt that the clauses on tax avoidance were very important, but said that we thought that some of it was too complicated and led to a lot of uncertainty for taxpayers&#039; advisers. The Inland Revenue&#039;s revised regulations came out just before our report; it knew perfectly well what we would say in our report, and I think that we are entitled to take some credit for the fact that our discussions with it might have had a little influence in that direction.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>I do not think that I need to go on. The tax measures for small companies were a good example of where the Government should have said, &quot;Look, we got it wrong. We&#039;re just going to put it right&quot;. The complications that they have brought in to justify carrying on are a good example of additional complication which is really not necessary and which does not make that much difference.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>However, by and large, I hope that we were fair and reasonable about the proposals. We supported what the Government were trying to do and I hope that our contribution to the debate was useful to those who have to make the final decisions.

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="40720-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, it is a more than usual pleasure to speak in this debate. We always have these debates at the end of the Session, and I think it is fair to say that the participants increasingly fall into the category of &quot;the usual suspects&quot;. It is therefore a great delight to have not one but a hat-trick of maidens&#151;to mix my cricketing metaphors&#151;this evening. We have greatly enjoyed them all.

</p>

<a name="40720-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>I endorse the comments of the noble Lord, Lord   Bhattacharyya, about the regeneration of Birmingham. In a previous existence, I was involved in the early stages of the redevelopment of what is now Brindley Place. The change in central Birmingham in the past 20 years has been phenomenal. It has been a classic example of a public and private sector joint initiative in its various ways. I suppose that it is an early example of the third way, which I hope will please the noble Lord, Lord Giddens.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>All three maiden speeches were exceptionally erudite. It is slightly unusual, however, for Members of your Lordships&#039; House to use their maiden speeches effectively as auditions for their membership of the Economic Affairs Select Committee or its sub-committee on the Finance Bill, but we will let them off this time.

</p>

<a name="40720-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>I neither propose nor have time to make a speech on the general economic situation. I shall deal mainly with the report of the sub-committee. We on these Benches have major questions about the Government&#039;s ability to meet their efficiency targets. I am just glad that I am not in the shoes of Mr Oughton, who has the terrible responsibility of carrying them forward.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>The work of the sub-committee this year, like last year, has been concentrated, hard and detailed. We received a large number of expert submissions. We spoke to a number of expert witnesses, all of whom had devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to producing their evidence. The committee was absolutely in their debt, because it was dealing with very detailed matters, on which it is fair to say that none of us have great or immediate expertise. Our witnesses guided us through it and we felt that we ended up with a reasonable understanding of the issues. We are grateful to them, as we are to our advisers, our Clerks and our Chairman, who has taken us through the remarkably difficult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_202"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business of getting the sub-committee working. It was a difficulty not of his making, but one through which he guided us with his usual charm and persistence.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>I shall mention a number of issues that demonstrate some of our specific and more generic concerns about the measures and processes of the Finance Bill. On the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes, all members of the committee agreed that those provisions were sound in principle. The problems with which we and the experts were grappling were problems of definition. There was a lack of clarity about exactly what was going to be covered, or what the Inland Revenue wanted covered, by the disclosure provisions. Although achieving that clarity was going to be difficult, we felt that it was not impossible. Indeed, it will have to be achieved at some point. We felt that more work should have been done before the legislation was set in stone.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>There is a danger of over-reporting with the current provisions, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord   Peston, that it may be a temporary problem. It is a real concern, however, in the short term. Some of the detailed provisions&#151;for example, the five-day reporting period&#151;were simply silly. They should have been changed and, with more time, I think they would have been. The key question for this series of provisions is how effective they will prove to be, but only time will tell. We certainly wish them well.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>The non-corporate distribution of profits was a textbook case of the unintended consequences of a tax change undertaken for perfectly understandable and good reasons. However, having got it wrong, we feel that the simpler thing might have been simply to reverse it, rather than to end up with this rather complicated scheme under which a certain proportion of profits, if undistributed, are not taxable. We had great fun thinking about the owner of the milk float or the taxi who would save his profits to invest in this new piece of capital equipment. At the end of the day, the argument that capital allowances might be a more effective way of dealing with that won out. The general principle demonstrated was an unwillingness on the part of the Treasury to admit, except through the most gritted of teeth, that it had made a mistake, to own up to it and reverse it.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>The final specific issues to which I should like to refer both demonstrate the case for taking a bit more time. On stamp duty and land tax, we asked people, having looked at them, how they had fared over the winter when they were introduced. The general impression was that they had just about muddled through. However, there should have been no need just to muddle through, if a bit more time and care had been taken. The strain that muddling through put on both business and the Revenue was, in my view, unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>As a number of noble Lords have already explained, the starting point of the issue of duty stamps for sprits&#151;namely, the scale of tax evasion that the measure was seeking to counter&#151;was completely in dispute. The answer to the question of whether this was a proportionate measure for dealing with the issue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_203"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

depended on whether you were looking at the bottom end or top end of the estimate scale. If the problem was at the bottom end of the scale, the measure was clearly disproportionate as it could cost the industry more per annum than the Revenue saved. My own guess&#151;for what it is worth, from causal observation and knowing a bit about the structure of the industry&#151;is that the reality is at the bottom end of the estimates. That makes me doubly sceptical about the measure.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>We were particularly concerned that the proposals that the Government had brought forward would hit smaller businesses in this sector particularly hard. We were also concerned that there appeared to have been little or no high-level consultation between Customs and Excise and the DTI.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>Finally, I was completely unimpressed by the argument that the industry was going to benefit by freezing the duty. Certainly since the days when I was a Customs and Excise official in the mid-1970s, there were arguments about the elasticity of demand for spirits. From time to time, there was a decision by the Chancellor to freeze duty on spirits, purely because the advice he received was that an increase in duty at that point would be counter-productive. I suspect that that is the advice that the Chancellor is getting now. Therefore, it is unsustainable to argue that this freeze is to help them deal with the problem.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>The Finance Bill failed the length and complexity test: it was too long and complicated. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, that there needs to be more exposure of drafts and a greater dialogue with all those concerned. I also agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, in his description of the deterioration of the Financial Statement and Budget Report from a short, clear, precise and purely factual document into a flaccid spun document that makes it very difficult to get to the reality of what is happening.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>Finally, there is the question of the role and attitude of the Treasury and the way in which it dealt with our queries. The report is, as always, very mild mannered and gentlemanly, as one would expect. By refusing to answer our questions fully, far less to come back to the committee, the Treasury showed a pig-headed and pathetic attitude. What is it scared of? What does it think the committee was going to do, other than to improve the quality of the legislation? That flows from a basic lack of understanding about the way in which the House of Lords and our committee work. As other noble Lords have said, we work in a non-partisan and meticulous way. That is the way in which the House of Lords works when it is at its best. A failure to understand what we are trying to do&#151;to improve the quality of legislation&#151;lies at the heart of the Treasury&#039;s difficulty.
</p>

<a name="40720-31_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>I hope that our work on the report has had some effect. For the first time our colleagues in the other place have referred to it, which suggests that at least somebody has read it. There is even a slight glimmer that one or two people in the Treasury may have noticed and responded to it. I therefore hope that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40720-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased to have this opportunity to wind up for these Benches. Like my noble friend Lady Noakes and others, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for introducing the report of the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee, and I pay tribute to noble Lords who worked on and produced this valuable report in the short timescale that was allowed. We have heard from many of those noble Lords tonight.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>To use a cricketing metaphor, three maidens bowled us over, as they say. It was marvellous to hear three maiden speeches this evening. It was particularly good to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, with whom I worked previously when I was chairman of the National Consumer Council. He condescended to come and join us and then beat us all to death for being so slow and lackadaisical. He was absolutely marvellous to work with. I am sure that if he continues as he started tonight in this House, he and the other noble Lords who spoke this evening will be a wonderful asset.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>Indeed, it is very nice for us to discuss a Finance Bill in this House and to have so many noble Lords speaking from the Labour Benches. We have sometimes had the Minister here all on his own. It is very nice indeed to have him here tonight with a bit of company.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>While your Lordships&#039; House is unable to scrutinise the legislative aspects of this Bill in its normal fashion, that does not prohibit noble Lords from passing on their expert thoughts and comments on its bulky content. As my noble friend Lady Noakes said, the sheer size and length of this year&#039;s Finance Bill will have had the alarm bells ringing throughout the land, from small businesses to the private investor&#151;individuals who are simply trying to earn a living in our already overburdened and overregulated business and corporate environment.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>I turn to some of the finer detail of the Bill. It does nothing but increase the complexity of compliance costs for taxpayers and their advisers. I am sure that we all agree that Finance Bills must strike an acceptable balance between the protection of revenue and the imposition of compliance costs on the taxpayer. Sadly, the Bill fails to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>Virtually all experts agree that the background to the Finance Bill is the Chancellor&#039;s need to raise taxation sooner or later in the face of a current structural deficit of some &#163;35 billion. In addition, there is a black hole of an estimated &#163;13 billion arising largely from what the Institute for Fiscal Studies assesses as over-optimistic projections for corporate tax revenues.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>The tax take is going up by nearly 8 per cent this year to &#163;31 billion, after a 6 per cent increase last year and before a further 8 per cent increase next year. Our country&#039;s people and businesses face major tax <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_205"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

increases now and if Labour were to win the next election, who knows how much more they will face afterwards? All this is before the detail of the Bill is unleashed on the unsuspecting taxpayer. Our taxes have been rising steadily under Labour even before this Bill. The net effect of the previous seven Budgets and Finance Bills equates to an extra &#163;5,000 per household per year. I wonder how many people believe that they would have got better value for money if they had kept that &#163;5,000 under their own control to spend on their families as they saw fit in the light of their own circumstances rather than having it forced on them by Nanny Brown Knows Best with 60 silent tax rises in seven Budgets and this year slipping in six more.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>In this Bill there is a new tax on small companies, a tax on UK businesses for transfer pricing, a tax rise on red diesel, a tax hike on other road fuels, a new tax on trusts, a tax on the whisky industry and a sixfold tax rise on company vans. Is that what the Chancellor has in mind when he talks about creating an enterprise economy?

</p>

<a name="40720-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>In this evening&#039;s debate there has been a number of powerful and constructive contributions. My noble and learned friend Lord Howe welcomed the simplification in the pension field, although regretted so far the lack of a tax structure review project. The noble Lord, Lord   Sheldon, was looking for wider consultation on the Finance Bill particularly as regards the whisky strip stamps on which I shall comment in a moment. My noble friend Lord Northbrook spoke about small business taxation incorporation. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, spoke about something rather revolutionary&#151;cultural change rather than so much regulatory change. I am with him on that. Corporate and social responsibility is very close to my heart. I set up and chaired the Corporate and   Social Responsibility Committee for Cadbury-Schweppes plc. We believe that it has not done anything to hurt our profits so far. We are very pleased at how it is performing. I would certainly encourage the Government to listen to the noble Lord and to encourage that in the future.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, spoke about a better and more knowledgeable Inland Revenue. My noble friend Lady Noakes and I were very pleased with that and had a little smile. It was not so many years ago that she and I were both co-opted on to the Inland Revenue with the new idea of non-executives to shake them up. So we were very delighted to hear that our noble friend believed that things had gone well. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, was concerned at the Government&#039;s ability to meet their efficiency targets. He spoke of tax avoidance and definition, undistributed profits and the mistake of the Inland Revenue. He commented on the whisky strip stamps.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>I shall quickly comment on those two areas myself, small business taxation and whisky strip stamps. The Government have introduced a 19 per cent minimum rate of corporation tax on distributed profits. In summary, the measure effectively withdraws the benefit of the zero-rate band from those small companies that pay all their profits to their shareholders. That typically includes the large <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

population of owner-managed companies where the owner is the sole shareholder and needs to withdraw most or all of the profit from the company in order to meet living expenses. This step will obviously be felt most keenly by small businesses who in many cases have to make do without expert tax assistance.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>Indeed, there is significant concern among the business community about the complexity of the new rules for the calculation of corporation tax. Estimates based on Inland Revenue data suggest that 40 per cent of small companies might be affected by this measure in any one year. That could equate to about 332,000 owner-managed companies who simply do not have the time or the resources to be able to manage with such added complexity.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>We have already referred to the whisky strip stamps. I fear that the idea that the introduction of pre-paid strip stamps on bottles of whisky is the most effective step in combating fraud is misguided, as the noble Lords, Lord Sheldon and Lord Newby, argued. To base a decision on the significantly conflicting evidence on the extent of the problem is a grave and worrying development. Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and   Excise put the figure of fraud at &#163;600 million in 2001&#150;02 and on an upward trend; the industry itself believes that the figure is between &#163;160 million and &#163;200 million with a downward trend. Noble Lords will be aware that the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee published a report on its own inquiry into this proposal. The report said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;The differences in the estimates of spirits fraud are so fundamental&#151;the estimates do not overlap even marginally at any point in their ranges&#151;that the Government cannot logically make such an important decision as the introduction of strip stamps based on figures which may be flawed . . .  the Government appears to be reacting in response to what is an unconfirmed level of fraud, with the possibility of major implications for the industry&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>That is a serious concern, and your Lordships will agree that there is no basis for making substantive policy decisions.
</p>

<a name="40720-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>Furthermore, how do we know whether that rather antiquated system&#151;or, as the Scottish Affairs Committee called it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>will actually work to combat fraud? I would have thought it a relatively easy operation to produce counterfeit stamps. Indeed, I hazard a guess that some ingenious person is more than likely working on it already.

</p>

<a name="40720-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>It has been a good debate. Unfortunately, we do not have time to explore many of the key aspects of the Bill. My noble friend Lady Noakes and I have tried briefly to highlight our remaining concerns. Much of what the Bill introduces will add more bureaucracy and complexity to a financial and business environment already groaning under this Chancellor&#039;s fixation with micro-management and regulation. Where the Government had a real opportunity to simplify, they have increased complexity; where they had a real opportunity to alleviate, they have burdened. That is a great failure of the Bill. As my noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_207"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

friend Lady Noakes said, the Bill is a monument to the intruder state and sadly produces no net benefit to the life of this country and the life of our people.

</p>

<a name="40720-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>I end by agreeing with the Labour Peer, the noble Lord, Lord Peston&#151;an economist and the distinguished chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee&#039;s sub-committee on the Bill&#151;who said that he feared that this might be the end. I fear he could very well be right.

<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40720-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I always enjoy these debates, but I enjoy them particularly when there is an opportunity for us to listen to three such distinguished maiden speakers as we have heard tonight. When the Prime Minister made his modest attempt to raise the proportion of Peers supporting the Government from 29 per cent to, I think, 31 per cent, there were the usual cries about stuffing the House of Lords with &quot;Tony&#039;s cronies&quot;. However, I hope that everyone here will agree that, in addition to the quantity, which we certainly needed, we have the highest quality that could conceivably be imagined. I am enormously grateful to all three noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, not only made a nonsense of the Tebbit rule on cricket, but brought expertise in manufacturing, as both a teacher and a practitioner. That will be of huge value to the House. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, brought us a rational approach to taxation that I found very refreshing. He rejected the dogmatism of the Left in favour of economic taxation designed to support economic dynamism and risk-taking. He rejected the dogmatism of the Right in defending the role of taxation for social protection and, above all, he offered us a moral basis for taxation and equated it with a civilised society. I agree very much with that, and am grateful to him for what he said. I do not know Luton   as well as some people, but the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, has distinction in local government and in accountancy. His contribution made the best of both those distinctions.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_573"></a>In one way, however, I am disappointed in the debate, because, in past years when I have occupied this position, I have had an opportunity to discuss wider issues in Finance Bills and in the economy. However, this year and last, it was decided by the usual channels that the Finance Bill would be debated together with the report of the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee of this House. I am not one to attack that decision, but the result has been that some pages of outline that I prepared for what I was going to say have been left blank. There has been no debate about public services this evening, and no debate about productivity or enterprise. I can simply remove those pages, put them away and save your Lordships&#039; time. However, I would like to have discussed those matters, because some things need to be said in more detail than I used in my opening speech.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_574"></a>Even on the basic issue of the state of the economy&#151;of macroeconomics as opposed to taxation policy&#151;very little was said. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

made a valiant attempt to attack the Government on their economic policy, but not by going so far as to say that it was not working. Instead she said that perhaps at some time in the future it might not work. That is a somewhat defensive position for her to take. I remember her making it clear to me that she was not criticising the economy in the short term but in the medium term. I have listened to these debates for seven years now. Rather than saying that there is no jam today people always say that there will be disaster tomorrow. It never happens. Let us see.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_575"></a>On the golden rule, the economy and the Chancellor are on track for both of the fiscal rules. The Budget calculations show an &#163;11 billion margin and there is a &#163;53 billion margin before we reach the 51 per cent under the sustainable investment rule. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said that there were over-optimistic projections of tax revenue. As is well known, the National Audit Office has audited the assumptions behind the Budget, which are reflected in last week&#039;s spending review statement, and it has approved them. Certainly, on any estimate from independent economists the projections are on the cautious side rather than in the other direction.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Noakes and Lady   Wilcox, both talked about the risk of tax rises in the future. The spending plans announced last week reflect the 2004 Budget public finance projections and they have been audited as being fully affordable.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, who also contributed to some extent to the debate on macroeconomic issues, talked about the decline in the savings ratio. I think that I have said this to him before, but I must point out that savings ratios are high at times of insecurity and high interest rates. The savings ratio has gone down because of low interest rates and a greater degree of security, but at the same time net assets have risen and household net worth has increased by 50 per cent since 1997. In terms of economic stability, that is an important point.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a>Points were made from the Opposition Front Bench about tax ratios&#151;what they call the tax burden. The tax ratio was lower in 2003 than it was in 1997&#150;98. It is expected to rise as the economy recovers from the recent global downturn, but it will still be lower than the heights reached in the early 1980s. It was 38.9 per cent, for example, in 1984&#150;85. This is a relatively lightly taxed economy. Our overall tax ratio is well below the average both for the EU 15 and for the EU 25.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>I turn now, since there is no further criticism on macroeconomic policy to defend, to the issues in the Finance Bill to which the committee referred. I must say before I go any further that the noble Lord, Lord   Peston, has achieved something in that every speaker who has referred to it has asked for the continuation of the committee that he chaired in future years. I think that he is well aware that the Treasury would not welcome that. It must be observed in fairness that he has secured the confidence of those who have spoken in the House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_209"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_580"></a>The first and most important issue is tax avoidance. That issue is one of those on which noble Lords&#151;I cannot remember which exactly&#151;said that they agreed with the Treasury&#039;s objectives on all of the five issues that the committee considered. Certainly, my noble friend Lord Peston referred to the size of the problem of tax avoidance. In fact, my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton beat me. I wrote down &quot;gilt strip&quot; and &quot;off-market swap&quot;, which are tax avoidance measures that I had never heard of. Clearly, we are learning something tonight.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_581"></a>It is an enormous problem, and it needed to be tackled. We recognise that there is a risk of over-reporting, a point made by my noble friends Lord   Peston and Lord Sheldon and by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. That is why we are working with business on the regulations and guidance that will give effect to the provisions in the Finance Bill on tax avoidance.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>My noble friend Lord Sheldon thought that there was something wrong with the five-day notification period. It is a notification period for products that are already on the market or are available to be sold or marketed. There is no reason why they should not be available for reporting within one day&#151;let alone five days&#151;of going on to the market. He criticised the lack of the affirmative resolution procedure for the prescribed descriptions orders. The prescribed descriptions order reduces the tests. In other words, it is limiting, whereas the VAT order, which is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, imposes additional requirements. That seems to be a reasonable balance.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, puzzled me by talking about a new tax on trusts. There is no new tax on trusts. The changes in trust legislation are designed to help small trusts; they are not an additional tax.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>On the issue of non-corporate distribution, my noble friend Lord Bhattacharyya went so far as to depart from the principle of non-contentiousness&#151;very, very marginally&#151;by saying that there was a degree of uncertainty about the Government&#039;s policy on the matter. I think that it is recognised that there has not, in fact, been a policy change. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, described it as a mistaken attempt, resulting from over-enthusiasm. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, went so far as to say that we should reverse the zero and 10 per cent starting rates. The zero and 10 per cent starting rates work. They have worked for a larger number of people than are affected by the 19 per cent charge on non-corporate distribution. The introduction of those starting rates was followed by Internet-based, mass-marketed incorporation schemes that were designed only for tax saving. It is those schemes that will be eliminated by the Finance Bill.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>Several noble Lords referred to the stamp duty land tax. Even the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in what was only a glancing reference, neglected to mention the fact that it has worked well since December 2003. I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_210"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 210</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

think that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, used the words &quot;muddling through&quot;, but there has not been any evidence of distortion in conveyancing markets. The vast majority of transactions have been unaffected by the changes. I agree with my noble friend Lord Peston that this is another example of outrageous tax avoidance via partnerships. I notice that the defence of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was not very robust.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, raised the issue of payable tax credits on ISAs. It was never intended that ISAs or their predecessors&#151;PEPs and TESSAs&#151;were going to continue for ever. There has been a reduction from &#163;7,000 to &#163;5,000, but it will take place in 2006 not in 2000 as originally intended. In any case there are so many additional offers, including child trust funds, stakeholder products and the advantages of pension simplification, that that criticism does not hold water.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>The references to spirit duty stamps puzzled me. My puzzlement is because I am also a statistician of a sort: a practical statistician rather than an academic statistician. The scale of evasion&#151;in other words of illegality, of fraud&#151;is by definition what we call an unknowable statistic. The calculations made are based on a comparison of the answers to the question in the general household survey, &quot;How much do you drink?&quot;, with the amount of spirits on which duty is paid. If we search our consciences, whether we are talking to a doctor or to an interviewer, any of us will tend to underestimate rather than overestimate the amount we drink and therefore the estimates of fraud are likely to be too low rather than too high. I am insulting noble Lords; I can see that everyone is very shocked.
</p>

<a name="40720-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>My noble friend Lord Sheldon and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that there had not been consultation on compliance costs. Consultation started in 2001 and took place on the options again in 2003; and a third set of consultations took place between last year&#039;s Pre-Budget Report and the Budget. With a central estimate of fraud at &#163;600 million and the highest estimate of compliance costs at &#163;50 million this strikes me as rather a good deal.

<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40720-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sheppard of Didgemere: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has either answered or dismissed many of the   questions that we asked the Treasury. Does that make it doubly sad that the Treasury could not give us the answers if they were so simple?
</p>




<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="40720-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I followed my noble friend Lord Peston, who refrained from the kind of debate we had last year about the Treasury&#039;s attitude towards the Select Committee. I thought that it would be an advantage to your Lordships if I did not enter that debate. I could say many things on the subject, going back to the Commons&#039; resolutions of 1671 and 1678, but if the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard, will forgive me, I am not going to do that this evening.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>I accept that the committee reported and that it is proper for me to respond to what it said, which is what I have been doing tonight. It would be better for all of us if we left it at that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_211"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column 211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>I turn to pensions. What the noble Baroness, Lady   Noakes, called so-called simplification did not meet with the agreement of other speakers. If 170 pages of text replace 350 pages of primary legislation and also replace many thousands of pages of guidance, that cannot be called so-called simplification; it is real simplification.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, described that as a legitimate alibi for a part&#151;I accept that it is only a part&#151;of the length of the Finance Bill. I rest my case on his remarks. The noble Baroness, Lady   Noakes, said that we were favouring public sector final salary pensions. I thought that the consensus was that the 20:1 factor had been accepted as being broadly accurate for both final salaries and defined contribution schemes and that any alternative put forward&#151;and there were alternatives put forward&#151;had been resisted as excessively complicated.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>The National Association of Pension Funds said that there had been a good consultation with the Revenue and the Association of British Insurers described it as a very thorough and constructive consultation process.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>So, on nearly all of the issues we have some worthwhile contributions from the committee, to which I have attempted to respond. I have discovered that it was the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, who said that he had no difficulty with the objectives of the five topics that were covered. Of course, legitimate points were made by those who gave evidence to the committee.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>I shall finish with a word about Finance Bills, particularly in response to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, to whom we all defer, because of his experience in the Treasury and as Chancellor and because of his sterling work on the revision of tax legislation. Yes, of course there has been an increase in the sheer volume of the Finance Bill. We can see it there on the Table. Yes, there has been an increase in the length of the Red Book. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, objected to what he called the self-congratulatory wording of the Red Book. I shall not attempt to give an aesthetic criticism of it, but I notice that the noble and learned Lord and other noble Lords have talked about the wording of it rather than attempting to rebut the facts in the Red Book.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>When this party was in opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, from the Opposition Front Bench used to take the Red Book every year and he would tear it apart. He would take it line by line, page by page, table by table until the Treasury spokesman for the Conservative government could hardly bear it. When we have an Opposition who are able to do that, when we have a Treasury which makes it possible by the degree of inaccuracy and over-optimism that was at <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>However, this evening it has been my privilege to listen to and congratulate three excellent maiden speakers.

<a name="40720-34_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Lord Haskel):  </b> As we rarely debate orders in Grand Committee, it may be helpful to say a word about the procedure for today&#039;s Grand Committee. Our proceedings are essentially the same as those of the House. Noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be reported in <i>Hansard</i>.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>As we are in Committee, Members may speak more than once on any Motion.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I should perhaps make it clear to noble Lords that this Committee is charged only to consider orders, not to approve or disapprove them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The main difference between our proceedings and the proceedings on the Floor of the House is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any Motion on which agreement cannot be reached should be withdrawn.
</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40720-34_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Budget (No.   2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>It is a matter of regret that this legislation is not being considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly, and we all hope that the ongoing review process will lead to a speedy restoration of the devolved institution. However, good government and the provision of public services in Northern Ireland must continue and therefore it falls to Parliament to consider the issue before us today.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The main purpose of the draft order is to authorise the balance of the 2004&#150;05 main estimates, which is in addition to the vote on account that was approved by Parliament in March. The vote on account, amounting to approximately 45 per cent of the total provision for the 2004&#150;05 financial year, enabled funds to continue to flow to public services for the early months of this financial year until the main estimates before us today could be presented and considered.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The balance of the 2004&#150;05 main estimates contained in the order amounts to some &#163;6 billion resources and &#163;5.5 billion cash. When added to the vote on account, it will take the total amount authorised for 2004&#150;05 to &#163;11.3 billion resources and &#163;9.9 billion cash. This reflects the outcome of the 2003 priorities and budget process announced by my honourable friend in another place on 13 January 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>That outcome evolves through a process involving widespread consultation with a range of local organisations including city and district councils, voluntary and community organisations, the business community and trade unions. In addition, as part of the consultation process, my honourable friend met with the main Northern Ireland political parties.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>I can therefore assure your Lordships that the spending plans before us today reflect the priorities of the local community in Northern Ireland. The order also seeks to authorise the excess resource amount in both the 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 financial years. The matters have been the subject of consideration and of subsequent report by the Public Accounts Committee. The report which was published on 25 May 2004 recommended that the excesses should be authorised by Parliament by means of excess votes.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Considerable detail regarding the sums sought is set out in the documents supporting the 2004&#150;05 main estimates and the statement of excess for 2001&#150;02 and for 2002&#150;03. Copies of these supporting documents have been placed in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="40720-34_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The introduction within each estimate provides a brief description of the nature of expenditure covered by the estimate, while the Part II subhead detail provides a breakdown of the proposed expenditure by functional area, with the associated cash requirement for the whole estimate. Comparative figures for the 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 financial years are also provided at Part II. I commend the order.

<a name="40720-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I am the first to admit my ignorance of the details of public accounting, and I shall leave that matter to others more expert than myself this afternoon. However, there are a number of issues to which I suggest Members of the Committee should pay attention when we discuss the draft Northern Ireland budget for the six-month period and onwards&#151;for the second time in the year.

</p>

<a name="40720-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>It is the duty of government to deliver competent and efficient administration to the part of the country or the nation for which it is responsible. This Government have been responsible for the administration of Northern Ireland for seven&#151;approaching eight&#151;years, I regret to say. They have had a number of complicated issues to face, over many of which we have been in agreement and support. However, we have now been without Stormont and the Assembly for nearly two years&#151;and I agree with the Minister when she regrets that. I regret it very much and believe that the situation would be very much more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

satisfactory were it to be being discussed by the Northern Ireland Assembly in Stormont. However, there is a duty of care on the Government.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>It is right to note, as my honourable friend David   Lidington pointed out in another place, that the Auditor General for Northern Ireland indicates that the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;quality of government services in Northern Ireland too often lets down the people who are using them and who are paying for them through their taxes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The system of public administration in Northern Ireland was described as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;disastrously fragmented. Almost every body in GB that carries out any function of government is duplicated on a tiny scale within Northern Ireland and that is an impediment to clarity and an enormous inefficiency&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, Northern Ireland Grand Committee, 8/7/04; col. 009.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>On a Starred Question from the noble Lord, Lord   Smith of Clifton, not long ago, I supported him and challenged the Government on this issue of wasted money. I believe that the Government are now guilty to a considerable extent of maladministration in terms of waste of public money in many different areas. Northern Ireland is grossly over-administered.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Government referred some time ago to a review of public administration, which was to set out plans to reduce the amount of administration in Northern Ireland&#151;hence, the costs&#151;to increase responsibilities on local authorities and to reduce the layers of government. If I am right, that was nearly two years ago, and we have still heard nothing from the Government on the matter.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Furthermore, we have had the situation of absenteeism, which has now grown disastrously in the Civil Service in Northern Ireland. I believe that the cost of absenteeism in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;39 million of public money. Would the Minister at some stage tell me what the costs for 2003&#150;04 are and whether anything has improved? I would also like to know where the reform of public administration has got to.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Another major issue affects this budget, on which I should also like answers&#151;that is, the NIPSA strike. The civil servants or any other employees normally go on strike only as a last resort. Having spent 30 years of my life in the manufacturing industry and having started on the shop floor and worked up through not the union but similar movements, I know the effect of poor leadership and low morale on the workforce. It leads to frustration and to wanting some way out and some form of recourse.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Northern Ireland Civil Service is in that situation, which is why we have the strike today. As I understand it, it is not getting any better; it is spreading and getting worse. Later today, we have an order regarding vehicle testing, which is bound to affect the overall budgets and finances of the Northern Ireland economy. We are an exporter. There are large hauliers hauling goods across Europe and bringing them back. Even if this order is accepted, it will cause huge difficulties on the continent if those hauliers are stopped regarding their necessary documentation. I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wonder how many of the officials in France and Germany will understand about an order passed today. That is the situation only for the hauliers.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We also have the farming community, which has suffered enough in the past few years. I declare an interest here: I have a farm with tenant farmers who are dependent on the grants that they are not being paid. At the end of June, the agricultural industry and the farmers were owed &#163;20 million. This weekend&#039;s Northern Ireland newspapers led me to understand that farmers are extending their borrowings with the banks, which is costing them more interest. Will the Government underwrite that interest and those loans? What recourse will the farmers have on account of the money that they will lose as a result of this strike?
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Finally, I do not wish to quip, but I could, about the efficiencies in the planning authority, which is also going on strike as of this week. That will affect the whole of the construction industry. It will affect future housing, future roads, future construction plans and a large amount of the cash flow and turnover in the Northern Ireland economy.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I am making a case today that the administration of Northern Ireland is far less than satisfactory. Once upon a time we had a health service of which we were very proud. Now, our health service is probably as poor as anywhere in this country with seriously ill people waiting to get beds, hanging about on trolleys in hospitals that are dirty and maladministered. We had an education system of which we were proud. Will the noble Baroness the Lord President give me an undertaking that she will not continue the move on the education system for the sake of some Labour Party dogma?
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>At this stage of the debate on the Northern Ireland budget, I put to noble Lords that the Government are doing a poor job, have done a poor that is getting worse and the effects of maladministration, which have now spread into a serious strike within the Northern Ireland Civil Service, will affect a very fragile economy very seriously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40720-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   In considering this budget order it necessary to put it in its context. In so doing, I shall echo some of the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. The condition of public finance in Northern Ireland is a cause for concern, while the infrastructure of the state apparatus is, in some respects, bloated, unwieldy and not fit for purpose. By contrast, since the Belfast agreement the private sector has seen a buoyant revival.

</p>

<a name="40720-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Compared with a decade ago, the city of Belfast has been transformed beyond recognition. If that economic development is to be sustained and further progressed, it requires to be complemented with a modernised government machine. In that regard, things have changed little in the past 10 years and in some respects may even have deteriorated.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>When I moved to Northern Ireland in 1991, it was essentially a public-sector economy and society. I described it as more collectivist than Stalinist Russia, more corporatist than Mussolini&#039;s Italy and more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC67</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

quangoised than the Britain of the two Harolds. Apart from the welcome resurgence of a prosperous private sector, little has altered in the mean time.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>For example, as this budget order shows, there is a massive underspend of some &#163;400 million of which &#163;220 million is for capital projects. A supercharged investment board was created a year ago to offer strategic guidance in that vital area. What has it been doing all year?

</p>

<a name="40720-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Another symptom of the bureaucratic malaise that infects government in Northern Ireland is seen in the recent Northern Ireland Audit Office report, to which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, alluded. It was a report on the excessive and growing recourse by government to commissioning outside consultants. The report identified an increase in expenditure from &#163;10 million to &#163;18.6   million during the past five years&#151;a rise of about 80 per cent. However, that seriously underestimates the situation, which is itself a grave cause for concern.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>As my noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland pointed out, the report presented a very incomplete picture. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;If one tries to piece together some of the evidence one cannot actually get to the actual expenditure on consultants&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>By way of illustration, my noble friend said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;In 2001&#150;02, it was certainly in excess of &#163;34 million . . .  but the worst element of all in this is that in 88 of the 100 cases studied in this report, there has been no proper evaluation about whether there was any benefit in these consultants being hired&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8/7/04; col. 915.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Thus, a double cause of concern is revealed by that NIAO report. On the one hand, it points to excessive reliance on outside consultants, poor procurement and a cavalier disregard for the DFP&#039;s guidance; while on the other, it shows up the inadequacy of the NAIO itself in being unable to come up with a comprehensive analysis of the full extent of the employment of consultants. Who will audit the auditors?
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Why are highly paid civil servants fearful of taking decisions that they are paid to take without calling in consultants to cover their backs? How has that lamentable state of affairs been allowed to come about? Has there been any attempt in Northern Ireland to undertake a Gershon-type efficiency saving exercise in the Civil Service, as there has in Great Britain?
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Northern Ireland, with 1.7 million people, is roughly the size of one and a half English counties, yet that budget far exceeds anything comparable in England and Wales. That is partly be due to the working of the Barnett formula, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, himself has repeatedly pointed out, is long past its shelf life and needs urgent reform. After all, happily, Northern Ireland is no longer the poorest region in the UK.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Secondly, the cost of security is disproportionately high for readily apparent reasons. However, even allowing for that, there can be no doubt that government costs are far too high. In that regard, I note that the costs of the moribund Assembly are estimated to rise from &#163;33.7 million to &#163;47.2 million per annum in the coming year. We hope that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Assembly will be restored in the autumn, because devolution should ultimately bring down the size of the budget. Initially, and not least because of the necessity to create no less than 11 government departments to accommodate the d&#039;Hondt formula for the allocation of ministerial portfolios, devolution increased costs. In the longer run, however, I believe that, as local Ministers have to make hard choices between competing demands and have perforce to prioritise public expenditure, costs will fall.
</p>

<a name="40720-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Under direct rule, Northern Ireland politicians of all shades, both here in Westminster and locally, are just part of the claimant culture to which, in its turn, the Civil Service and its mode of operation respond. It is an unhealthy situation, with totally inadequate political scrutiny and public accountability. Let us restore the devolved institutions and slim the budget and the bureaucracy.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040720/text/40720-36.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40720-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   Many Members of the Committee will recall that on 8 July, when the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, intervened on the Question of my noble friend Lord Smith about consultants, he gave us a sample of the literature that he had been receiving. Although I have taken the lectern, the sample, I have brought would have sufficed.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I do not complain about getting the literature because it proves to us what we are lacking with the Assembly not functioning. As we open the post day by day, all these letters from various departments in Northern Ireland are a steady reminder to us that the Assembly is not functioning and that it ought to be. Reference has been made to the possibility of a resumption in the autumn. If there is no resurrection of the Assembly in the autumn, I do not think that we can carry on scrutinising like this. I have been trying to scratch about as best I can and it is very difficult. There is a democratic deficit. The Minister has told us about the consultation that has taken place to put this budget together. But I cannot measure the quality of that consultation. I am sure that it is there but I cannot measure its depth and quality. If we are to be back again, we will have to find other ways of doing this.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>For a start, I find this document very difficult to fathom. I set about it by looking at the Barnett formula and seeing where that takes us in terms of the numbers because I cannot prove that it works. I cannot prove that what is in the document and what the Barnett formula produces match. I am not clear about what is paid for by UK taxpayers as a whole and is not covered under the devolved budget. I do not know how that fits with the Barnett formula. I also do not know how supplements from the European Union fit in. They are, to use the term, additionality. I cannot see how the big picture fits with what I see in this book. Indeed, in the book it is difficult to fathom what is different from A to B and occasionally C. It is designed to confuse. I would like to think that the starting point, the fundamentals, were clearer.

</p>

<a name="40720-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>When I spoke in March, I referred to an area that I know a little bit about, Northern Ireland railways. I said to myself, &quot;That&#039;s enough of that, pick something else to look at next time. See if you can get to something else in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

depth&quot;. But I regret to say that I must return to the railways because I referred then to a debate that appeared to be going on in Northern Ireland about the non-core railway, which was Whitehead to Larne and Ballymena and Londonderry.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>What I did not know then was that a book was to be produced by the Railways Review Group <i>A Position Report on the Future Investment Needs of Northern Ireland Railways. </i>It is the least glossy of any of the documents that have come out of Northern Ireland. It is only 30   pages. However, page 30 refers one to a consultants report, which is obtainable at www.translink.co.uk&#151;and all sorts of other things. That gives one another 220 pages from Booz Allen Hamilton. I have that in my paperwork here. Amazingly, there has also been a report on the railways in the Republic of Ireland by Booz Allen Hamilton. That report was over 400 pages. So there are well over 600 pages of consultants&#039; report on the railways of Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Sadly, however, this modest 30-pager talks of the closure of railway lines in Northern Ireland and yet&#151;this must be true because I read it in the consultants&#039; report&#151;Londonderry is the fourth city of Ireland. The railway line we are talking about would connect the second city of Ireland with its fourth city.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Looking at the report produced by the same consultants in the Republic, they talk about a feasibility study to look into the possibility of extending the railway from Londonderry to Letterkenny, which would be a costly venture. The consultants say that they have consulted with DETR Northern Ireland and Translink NIR, which suggests support. Yet those same folk are putting out these closure proposals. That is not joined-up government in any shape or form. It is time, as a piece of detail, for acts to be got together and acknowledge that the best option would be to return both of these railway lines. Indeed, the capital costs would be a mere fraction of what is to be carried forward in budget expenditure from last year to this. As I have said, that is an important piece of detail.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I know that some people are not too happy about cross-border bodies, but it is quite interesting to note, in terms of dual economy, that when we have Waterways Ireland, quite frankly it would make incredibly good sense to have &quot;railways Ireland&quot; as well. We should bear it in mind that the rail network in Northern Ireland is much smaller than that in the Republic, but they have so much in common when compared with anything in England, Scotland and Wales.

<a name="40720-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I want to talk next about European money. Several references are made to European funds from the various agencies throughout Europe in the budget document. What I cannot fathom is the approach to reconciliation. The last page of the yellow section of the book refers to the income coming from Europe in respect of the various funds while expenditure is set out on the red pages. It is impossible to reconcile the two figures, although that may well be quite proper given <br>&nbsp;<br>

the timing differences. But no attempt has been made to reconcile that. I cannot prove that the European moneys received will match the moneys paid out.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Several fortunate areas of European funding have grown out of the misfortune of Northern Ireland such as, for example, the Peace II EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation moneys. Much of that is spent on those people desperately searching for peace, many of them involved in voluntary and local community groups. Amazingly, peace money is also used to buy double decker buses in Belfast, but we shall let that pass by as one of those strange things that happens in government. I should have thought that the genuine expenditure of peace and reconciliation moneys is all about peace and reconciliation. However, I am worried about how the micro-economy that has built up over recent years will cope if, as a result of the addition of poorer states to the European Union, it is not possible to fund it in the same way. Questions arise over whether the peace and reconciliation funding programme will be slimmed down. There are concerns about that.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>On any basis, the figure of &#163;11,783 million is a large sum. I am concerned about best use of money. My noble friend Lord Smith has spoken about the various organisations in Northern Ireland, whose acronyms are NIA, NIB, NIC, NID, NIE, NIF, and so on, with the list going round several times because there are so many. Does every such outfit have human relations consultants, treasurers and staff to produce glossy books? Is there no possibility of economising on these establishment costs?

</p>

<a name="40720-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Perhaps we should consider benchmarking. The three largest counties in England are Essex, Kent and Hampshire, each with a population of around 1.2 or 1.3 million. The combined population of the neighbouring counties of Hampshire and Dorset is similar to that of Northern Ireland. The population of Hampshire and Dorset is around 1.63 million while that of Northern Ireland is around 1.69 million. The education budget for Hampshire and Dorset is &#163;803 million while Northern Ireland&#039;s is &#163;1,300 million. Of course, if a devolved government want to spend more money on education, they can, but I still wonder how those figures can be matched.

<a name="40720-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   Has the noble Lord looked at the difference in birth rates?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40720-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   I have not; I have looked only at the populations. Perhaps one can look at the figures in all sorts of ways. I accept that the comparison is totally imprecise. For example, the education budget of Northern Ireland includes libraries, but that constitutes quite a small proportion&#151;around 4 per cent of each school&#039;s budget. Even deducting the budget for libraries, there is a huge difference. Perhaps it will be possible to look at the numbers and reduce the difference, but I guess that the figure for Northern Ireland will still be substantially higher, and that may be right. But I want to know whether such matters are looked at.
</p>

<a name="40720-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>We are all concerned about due economy. Regardless of that, post enlargement there might be less European money. We should be looking at <br>&nbsp;<br>

opportunities to reduce expenditure in Northern Ireland, because an absence of European money would result in the collapse of certain areas of the Northern Ireland economy, particularly those paid for under the European Union Peace and Reconciliation Programme. Although the Assembly is in suspension, it is important that the matter is looked at carefully. By looking at some of the ways in which Northern Ireland is operated, with a view to sharing costs of producing glossy books, accountancy and treasury posts and clerkships of organisations, there could be due economy and money could be released to enable frontline work and essential voluntary and community work to continue.

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40720-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </b>   I agree almost entirely with what has been said already. Pending the possible reconstruction of the governance&#151;not government&#151;of Northern Ireland, a reduction in the vast number of departments and the thinning out of the number of curious bodies already referred to, which seem to be without visible means of support, we will remain in financial trouble. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has highlighted much of the wasteful expenditure. Unfortunately, the lack of clarity will be noted by other regions of the United Kingdom, which will cast envious glances across the Irish Sea and wonder how we have got away with it for so long. The inevitable result will be that Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury will start to pay heed to this drain on UK resources. We must be careful.

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I am not critical of civil servants as a body. They are bound to suffer from what I can only call the sheer stupidity and silliness of others. I implore Her Majesty&#039;s Government to institute a sound administrative structure for Northern Ireland on the grounds voted upon in 1979 by 14.5 million United Kingdom citizens. When some of us were bold enough to inquire why the structure was not proceeded with, the answer was, &quot;Because, Jim dear, it was not enough&quot;. Perhaps it was not enough and the United Kingdom electorate&#039;s appetite for constitutional government was not satisfied, but they should remember&#151;they probably now remember in hindsight&#151;that the alternative to &quot;not enough&quot; was bound to be nothing, which is precisely what we have now. We will continue to have nothing until we stop playing games that are designed mainly&#151;I have to say, perhaps uncharitably&#151;to keep the news industry happy. We must have summits, get-togethers, departmental heads and so forth, yet it all amounts to nothing. It is a con job, as the news industry knows well, although it exploits it and uses the fodder handed out to them&#151;who can blame them?

<a name="40720-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I implore Her Majesty&#039;s Government. They have exhibited a good deal of realism in their thinking on various other national and international policies. Surely, it is not asking too much for them to look again at what was voted upon by the United Kingdom electorate in 1979 but rejected because it did not go far enough, with the inevitable result that we got nothing.

I suggest that it is necessary and most desirable to have the maximum possible amount of exits and ways of leaving violence and terrorism which are open, available and can be used by those who want to do so. In brief, the object should be to deter the current rank and file of paramilitary groups and former offenders from moving into crime, as many already have done, and instead to help them in the direction of normal civilian employment.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>For some, perhaps only a tiny minority, emigration may provide a solution. For others there is the public sector, which is, after all, a very large employer in Northern Ireland, the commercial sector and numerous voluntary organisations and community associations. What are the Government doing about those possible lines of exit? Are incentives of any kind being provided for those who want to cease a life of violence? In general, what is the Government&#039;s policy and future intention?
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I wish to refer to integrated education, partly because the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council, in an Answer to a Written Question last month, told me that procedures are in place for transforming existing schools to integrated status. That in itself is good news, but have those procedures been used in recent years and what is the prospect of their being used more in the next year or two, given that there is strong parental demand for more schools providing integrated education? In view of the reducing, and already lower, numbers of pupils in secondary schools, some existing ones are functioning at about half-capacity. That surely gives scope for some move into an integrated mode. I look forward to the Government&#039;s response.

Further to the remarks of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Smith, I wish to draw attention to the fact that we have a Civic Forum in Northern Ireland, which was suspended along with the Assembly. Expenditure on the Civic Forum in the current year was &#163;176,000 compared to &#163;328,000 in 2002&#150;03. Estimates suggest that expenditure for 2004&#150;05 will increase to over &#163;0.5 million. One wonders how the costs of a body that is still suspended can increase threefold. It is a waste of money. When do the Government propose to disband the Civic Forum?

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The Government have said that they will refurbish or rebuild every secondary school in England and Wales to 21st century standards in the next 10 to 15 years. Will the Government confirm that they have the same plans for Northern Ireland schools, and if not, why? Will all mobile classrooms in Northern Ireland be replaced? If so, can the Government spell out exactly how they intend to do so? In my view, the only way to reform the schooling system is through public-private partnerships. What plans do the Government have to do that in Northern Ireland?

Why are the Government determined to implement Costello when all sections of society in Northern Ireland have indicated how ill suited it is? Grammar schools are not simply opposed to any change, as the Government claim. Representatives of grammar schools have been actively engaged in proposing workable changes as alternatives to the 11-plus, something that the Government have not managed to do in detail. What specifically are the Government&#039;s alternatives? What sort of system will emerge from the proposals? What will be the admissions criteria under the new system?

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I move on to a topic dealt with extremely well by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland: the problem of the funding of the railways. I am not sure that we want to be the only part of Europe where railways may be closed down. In every other part of Europe, railways are seen as part of the solution. They are being revamped and much capital funding has been going into them. I do not understand why little money has been spent on the non-core system&#151;the system that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, described. I cannot understand why there is such haste for the consultation on the document that the noble Lord discussed. I cannot understand why, despite a lot of prompting, no one has come up with a concept to promote, especially, the section of line from Coleraine to Londonderry, as a tourist attraction. I also cannot understand why, when we are on the verge of getting many millions of pounds worth of railway stock in Northern Ireland, closing the non-core section of the network is being considered before the stock has even had a chance to show what it can do on the railway system.

four and a half years, is the Ulster Scots Agency. The Government&#039;s understanding of its priorities is haywire and more in the realm of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> than of reality.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>For 2004, the desired budget for the Ulster-Scots Agency had &#163;600,000 removed from it that was specifically aimed at continuing a very successful policy of the agency in 2003. I want to be quite specific: it was removed without consultation, discussion or agreement. When I requested the minutes of meetings that the department says took place to discuss the matter, they were not available to me. Therefore, I can only conclude that there was no discussion; I know for a fact that there was no discussion.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Our policy, which is one in which I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, will be interested, was of replacing old-style murals depicting hooded gunmen and paramilitary imagery with murals celebrating historic themes such as scenes from the Great War and Ulster Scots language, culture and history. It was for the consignment of paramilitary flags to the past. It was for the organisation of family-friendly events on 11 July night, such as those organised by Mid-Armagh Community Network and the Schomburg Society of Kilkeel.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>It was for the provision of help, advice and financial support to those community leaders who want to effect positive change in their localities. It made funding available to pull the carpet from under the feet of those unsympathetic to change, by depriving them of one of their major arguments for maintaining the status quo. It was for the creation of new opportunities for Protestant and Unionist communities to explain and share their culture to and with their Roman Catholic and nationalist neighbours.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I cannot understand what is so wrong with that policy that it did not even warrant discussion or any form of agreement with us. We were never asked about the policy. The Ulster-Scots Agency successfully implemented the policy during 2003 but had to stop it this year because of lack of funding, the money being taken out. It seems to me that Her Majesty&#039;s Government are happy to pay police overtime and make compensation payments, but not to pay &#163;600,000 to the Ulster-Scots Agency, which, if it does not have the solution to the problem, at least has a solution. No one has told me any other solution to the problem of trying to put the society of Northern Ireland back on the rails, to deal with the paramilitaries and to try to take people out of their spheres of influence. Until someone tells me what is wrong with the Ulster- Scots Agency policy and gives me a better one, I think this is a disgrace.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>But the same department that looked after the activities of the language body also looks after Waterways Ireland. Waterways Ireland had a 40 per cent increase in its budget for 2004. It has never been able to spend its entire funding in any year to date and, as I understand it, has replaced as much as &#163;7 million in the central kitty. Yet it has had an increase of 40 per cent while we were deprived of a minute amount of money that would meet a social need in our Province.

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I cannot understand the decision-making process. Some people with a cultural view of Ulster-Scots activities went to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and asked to borrow &#163;100,000 for Ulster-Scots culture. After 11 months, a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and requests for rewrites, the request was turned down. I have here an Answer by the Minister to a Written Question on 14 June this year. It refers to funding for the West Belfast Festival, of which I am supportive. I have no difficulty with the festival being funded; it is not money lent, it is funding. The festival organisers submitted a request for over &#163;100,000 on 15 August 2003. What day was the request granted? On the very same day. Yet we asked for &#163;100,000 as a loan for Ulster-Scots culture and after 11 months it was turned down.

</p>

<a name="40720-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>What conclusion can we come to, except that the Ulster-Scots culture is not wanted on the island of Ireland? Things are slightly worse now. The North-South Ministerial Council, which has a specific remit, has been in discussions with both loyalist and republican paramilitaries. It has provided funding for an image consultant to provide a new image for Protestant paramilitary groups. I am not desperately opposed to that but this is the same organisation that presided over &#163;600,000 being taken out of our budget, which stopped us doing socially acceptable activities during 2004. Yet it has been organising and spending resources on promoting and helping loyalist and republican paramilitary groups, including the provision of an image consultant.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I have no doubt that the answer will be that this help is provided to the bank account that is run by the Government of the Republic of Ireland. But meetings are attended by officials of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. What remit has the Northern Ireland joint-secretary to the North-South Ministerial Council to exceed his authority and to talk to Protestant paramilitaries or to any paramilitary group? What remit has he to exceed his authority with regard to the North-South Ministerial Council, or was he acting on behalf of the North-South Ministerial Council? It is time that we had a total review, an inquiry, into exactly how these cross-border bodies have been funded and how they are totally unfair, simply interested in one side of the community and not the other.
</p>

<a name="40720-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I am not opposed to cross-border co-operation and I have discussed the matter with the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, on a number of occasions. I would support much of what he said. However, if there are going to be cross-border bodies, let them not be these bodies. Let them be bodies that are there on the basis of equity, fairness and providing funding and support on the basis of all-round need, not simply skewed to the request of the Irish Government.

As a one-time Minister, I have great sympathy for the noble Baroness today. She has to cover subject, after subject, after subject, the detail of which it would be difficult for her to understand. It is at present one of the most difficult portfolios to hold, particularly because of the way in which this budget is discussed in Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>There has been criticism of the Orders in Council, which is right, and there has of course been the confirmation that we have no Assembly in Northern Ireland due to the political situation within the Province. The process, for which the Minister is now responsible and must reply to, must be brought to an end. It is inadequate and unsatisfactory for everyone.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Therefore, we look towards September, the possible resolution of the political divisions in Northern Ireland and the return of democracy to Stormont. At the moment, that does not look hopeful. The people have voted for parties of the extremes and the likelihood of an agreement emerging in September is, in my opinion, unlikely.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>That being the case, we cannot continue with a suspended Assembly. One of the items in the budget is, of course, continued payments to Assembly Members and to their staff. I have defended them on previous occasions, but they have been made for the past two years. They are indefensible in future. If there is not agreement on an Assembly at Stormont, we must face up to the reality that devolution and the Belfast agreement have failed and that Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom will have to be governed from here in London on a more democratic basis, where the elected representatives are answerable for the decisions taken in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>There are hundreds of issues in the order, so the Minister cannot be expected to know them all. One of the more important is the reform of the rating system in Northern Ireland. I have spoken on the matter previously, and pointed out that Northern Ireland is in competition with southern Ireland to attract inward investment. Southern Ireland has always had, and still has, the advantage of a low corporation tax&#151;10 per cent. In Northern Ireland, although we had the high UK corporation tax, none the less, it was possible to point out to inward investors that we had derating for industrial premises.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>But now what have we? We have the Government saying, &quot;We are going to introduce rates for industrial premises. We are going to introduce rates for empty commercial and retail outlets&quot;. Incidentally, that move will deflate the property market in Northern Ireland as empty premises will now be sold rather than waiting for a potential tenant. So we are going to damage commercial property values in Northern Ireland and, at the same time, damage industrial investment.

</p>

<a name="40720-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The Government have said, &quot;While we introduce rates for industrial premises, at the same time we will initiate a reduction electricity prices for Northern Ireland&quot;. But recently the European Union, as it so often does, has rejected this initiative on the part of the Government. Thus the advantage of reduced electricity prices to balance the disadvantage of rates on industrial premises has now been lost. That being the case, since the Government&#039;s argument has now been undermined by the decision taken in Europe, I would suggest to Her Majesty&#039;s Government that this matter should be reviewed before any final decision is taken. If Northern Ireland is to be put at a disadvantage in comparison with southern Ireland&#151;not only on the issue of corporation tax, but also on energy prices and rates&#151;then that is bad news for the economy of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Having said that, I am not one of those who criticises the Government about everything in Northern Ireland, although there has been a lot of criticism today. Rather, I have to say that Northern Ireland is a wonderful place, even under the present Government. Things are going well. The population is increasing. I mentioned earlier the birth rate&#151;we are now 1.7 million. Our unemployment is falling and our employment is increasing. Tourism is prospering and house prices are soaring. There is good news from Northern Ireland as well, so let us in Northern Ireland not always be seen to be complaining and bellyaching.

</p>

<a name="40720-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Why is the population increasing? It is doing so because young people who left Northern Ireland during the 30 years of the Troubles are now coming back. In addition&#151;although the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, may be shocked by this&#151;many English people are coming to live in Northern Ireland, saying that the quality of life is far better than that to be found in many other parts of the United Kingdom. I can cite many examples of that in my own constituency because, as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I happen to be one of the rare species who is an elected representative in the House of Lords. In the constituency of Strangford, the census records that around 8 per cent of the population was born in Great Britain, not in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>One or two other issues have been mentioned. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, spoke of the cost of education. He was quite right to point out that the cost of education per head of the population of Northern Ireland is much higher than it is in England. I cite the higher birth rate as one reason for that. We have more children per family than is the case in England. But there are other burdens, one of which is supported by the noble Lord; that is, that we have different systems of education. We are financing three systems of education in Northern Ireland, not one. We finance the state system, the Roman Catholic system and, increasingly, we are financing the costly integrated system. The result of all that is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, pointed out, we now have schools which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

do not have sufficient pupils. That is because in each town we are sharing them out between different schools.

<a name="40720-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   Does the noble Lord agree that, because depopulation in some areas has resulted in insufficient pupils to support two forms of education, it presents a wonderful opportunity for another form of integrated education? In that way a small village can have at least one viable school rather than two non-viable schools.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40720-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   That is not practical in Northern Ireland. We have been through this throughout the history of Northern Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church requires its own education system and Unionist governments from 1921 onwards have supported that. The notion that that should be in some way removed and replaced with an integrated system is a political path which I will not go down.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40720-38_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Blood: </b>   What the noble Lord is saying is completely false. We have seven new schools coming through this year, two of which are transformed schools. We cannot keep up with the demand for integrated education. In small villages Protestant and Catholic schools are dying on their feet, so they come to us and ask for an integrated system.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The noble Lord referred to the fact that the British Government now support this move. They are supporting it after we sustained it for three years. We have had to prove the credibility of integrated education before it received government funding.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40720-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   That is partly correct.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40720-38_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Blood: </b>   It is not partly correct, it is correct.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40720-38_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   No, that is only partly correct. I know the situation in the different towns in Northern Ireland, and we are beginning to finance three systems. I am correct in saying that, not incorrect. Those three systems are the state system, the Roman Catholic system and now an integrated system. The Government are supporting all three. That means that three types of schools are competing for children in each town and each village. In smaller villages, there is no way in which there can be three schools. It was bad enough having two. In England, there would be only one, and it would be a viable unit.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>At the moment, it is not practical politics to suggest that the Roman Catholic Church should in some way close down its schools. That will remain a separate system in Northern Ireland, and I caution anyone to suggest that we should take on the Church to close down its school system in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>On the question of roads, I must compliment the Government on the new bypasses that have been built in places such as Newtonstewart, Strabane and Omagh. However, I suggest that some thought be given to provision in Cookstown, which is one of the worst towns to get through when travelling to the west of the Province. I see many Members of the Committee nodding their heads in agreement. That requires <br>&nbsp;<br>

priority attention, but it does not seem to be mentioned very often. Likewise, the road from Ballymena to Coleraine needs attention. We hear so much about the roads to Newry or Dublin, but the road to Larne, for example, carries twice as many cars as the road to Dublin. Why should the road to Dublin get priority from the noble Lord, Lord Shutt? That priority should be given to the road to Larne, which carries 16,000 vehicles per day. The Roads Service needs to give more thought to the road from Ballymena to Coleraine, and to a bypass at Cookstown.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, on the issue of railways. He mentioned something of which I was not aware and was interested to hear: that the same consultants were employed by both the southern Irish regime and the Northern Ireland Office. Interestingly, as a result of the southern Ireland part of it, the railway system is going to be expanded, whereas we in Northern Ireland are considering curtailing it. I hope that further thought will be given to the matter. The railway system from Ballymena up to Coleraine and Londonderry is vital for the second city in Northern Ireland. As road traffic increases, it is important that we have the alternative of the railway system, and I hope that no decision will be made to close that particular railway line.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I want to see some savings in the budget. In particular, I suggest that the Civic Forum should be done away with immediately&#151;not pending some future reorganisation of public services or government in Northern Ireland. The Civic Forum has been an absolute disaster and a total waste of money, and it is astounding that while it is suspended it is going to cost us more in the forthcoming year. That is ridiculous. It is simply a talking shop and served no purpose whatever, even when the Assembly was in session.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Another move that could save money&#151;the cost of a bypass somewhere, or &#163;4 million to &#163;5 million a year&#151;would be the removal of the area health and social service councils, which serve no purpose whatever in Northern Ireland. We already have area health boards, and we do not need the social service councils.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Planning is important. The NIPSA strike has been mentioned. That is a serious matter. Planning is bad enough in Northern Ireland without having a strike. People who are investing and coming into Northern Ireland will tell you that planning decisions take much longer in Northern Ireland than they do for similar projects in Great Britain. Retail outlets are horrified at the time it takes to invest in Northern Ireland, due to the delays in the planning system, which lacks resources.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Recently I saw a case of a planning application in Armagh city to convert a room into an office. It was accepted in February, but six months later no decision has been made because of lack of resources. Now it may not be made for another few months, if there is going to be a strike. So there needs to be further investment in the planning service in Northern Ireland.

<a name="40720-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>One project that is coming to some parts of Ireland is the Ikea store. It has difficulties in going to the Republic of Ireland because there is a restriction on the size of stores there. It could come to Northern Ireland if we had a proactive planning service in Northern Ireland and a proactive approach by the Government. The Government&#039;s attitude is that they do not want to speak to Ikea because they do not support stores. However, there are different ways and means in which to encourage a store of that nature. People go in their hundreds and perhaps their thousands from Northern Ireland to Scotland to go to the Ikea store. It would be a very popular store to have in the island of Ireland&#151;and one hopes in Northern Ireland. But that requires the Government to show an interest and not just sit back and take no action.
</p>

<a name="40720-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Finally, I conclude on European Union money and the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and others. The noble Lord said that he could not understand how much money was coming from Europe and how much was being spent in Northern Ireland. However, he failed to ask the third vital question&#151;how much in the first instance Northern Ireland is sending to European Union, before the EU sends money back and before we then spend it. The bad news is that we send more to the European Union than we get back.

<a name="40720-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   I should like to make a few brief comments. However, before I do, I should like to respond to a few things that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew1"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Kilclooney!
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   I do apologise, but I have known the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, a long time and old habits die hard.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The noble Lord said that it would be a shock to me to know that the population was expanding in Northern Ireland and that people from England were moving there. Not at all. Northern Ireland is a wonderful place and I am not at all surprised that people want to live there, now that the environment is more peaceful&#151;although not peaceful enough&#151;and with the economy doing well. Equally, I understand about living standards there. Other costs are lower, certainly than in the south-east of England, people&#039;s disposable income is higher and therefore their living standards are higher. That does not shock me at all.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The noble Lord referred to integrated education. He said that there were three different systems of schools and that he could not support them. First, every integrated school in Northern Ireland is full, and I understand that most are heavily oversubscribed. There is not a single integrated school in the history of Northern Ireland that has ever failed; they are incredibly successful and parents want them. I should have thought that it was right, in a democratic society, that when parents wanted the choice of a particular form of school for their children, that approach should be supported fully by the Government.

</p>

<a name="40720-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Some of us in the All-Party Group on Integrated Education in Northern Ireland had a meeting with an Education Minister recently and put those various points to him. Although there is progress on integrated education, it is not moving as quickly as some of us would wish. But I dissent from the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, when he talked about integrated schools being a burden. Indeed, they are not a burden but economically successful because they are full and over subscribed. If other schools are less popular, that is not an argument for denying parents the choice of an integrated school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   I must explain, because I believe that there has been a misunderstanding. I did not say that those schools were a burden; I said that the Government in Northern Ireland has to finance three systems of education there&#151;the state system, the integrated system and the Roman Catholic system, whereas in England there is only the one system. I never used the word &quot;burden&quot;. I am saying that we have to finance more than they have to in England, which is the simple explanation why education costs are so much higher in Northern Ireland than they are in England.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   I understand what the noble Lord is saying, although I should have thought that the reason why education costs are higher in Northern Ireland could only very slightly be attributed to integrated education. If one considers the benefits of integrated education, on which we should not spend too much time in a debate on the budget, I would say that the benefit to the society of Northern Ireland was out of all proportion to the costs of integrated schools.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>One further point about integrated education is that the Government are paying for teacher training. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom in which teacher training is segregated on grounds of religion&#151;not on a tripartite system, but with a Catholic teacher training establishment and a Protestant one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   That is not quite true. Teacher training in the University of Ulster, over which I have the honour to preside, is integrated.

</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   That is welcome. However, with the exception of the example given by the noble Lord, most teacher-training in Northern Ireland is segregated. It seems contrary to the principles of higher education that there should be religious segregation&#151;all the more so because some of those teachers will teach in integrated schools. Such a division seems wrong, and the Government fund it. All that I am saying is that, if the Government fund a system, they have a little leverage on the powers that be to make some progress. That is my plea.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>My comments on the railways will be much more popular, as I agree very much with what was said. In Britain we are still suffering from the vandalism <br>&nbsp;<br>

perpetrated by the Beeching cuts. There are many areas of the country where people would dearly wish to restore the railways, although they are not always able to, as some have disappeared altogether. They can be restored more economically than the old system that they replaced.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I would hate to see the lovely railway system along the north coast of Northern Ireland closed down and destroyed. It is an asset in terms of tourism, the economy and links between the two main cities in Northern Ireland. It would be most unfortunate if the Government did not feel able to continue that system. I only wish that they would say, &quot;Yes, we will keep them and modernise them&quot;. The superb modernised system between Belfast and Dublin is one of the best railways not only in Ireland but also in Britain. If we can have a good system there, I do not see why we cannot have a decent, modern, effective and economic railway system linking the two main cities in Northern Ireland. I hope that the Government will reconsider their approach, as evidenced by the consultation documents, of thinking of closing it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40720-39_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   I had not intended to speak on this order, but some of the matters raised have encouraged me to do so. There has been debate on the extent to which education costs derive from the fact that we have three parallel systems. We accept that having three systems increases the cost of delivering education; we live with that.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The education system endeavours to cater for all children right across the board, which it does with considerable success. I declare an interest as a former primary school principal, but Northern Ireland compares favourably with the rest of the United Kingdom in its delivery of education. Despite that, we are now having the Costello report imposed on us. I do not have time to go into the detail of what it entails and its impact on the education system, nor is this the place for me to do so. But it is significant that when I asked what sort of infrastructure audit had been carried out of the current education provision, from which the Costello report would have to be implemented, I was told bluntly that there had been no infrastructural audit.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>My reason for rising to my feet is that it is absolutely intolerable that we have the sort of disruption that Costello will bring to the education system in Northern Ireland. We are being told that there has been no infrastructure audit and no real thought has been given to how Costello can gel with what is currently a fairly successful system. If that is the basis on which educational planning is being carried forward by this Government, how can we have any hope of proper financial planning or use of the finite resources that are available? I shall be particularly interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that. My question derives from the statement to the effect that there has been no infrastructure audit of educational facilities in Northern Ireland. How can one make changes without having assessed one&#039;s starting point?

<a name="40720-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>My one other point relates to the issue of autism, raised by my colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Laird. There is a gap left where the Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety between them fail autistic children. A great deal of emphasis has been placed on early intervention, and I have personal experience of how that can be successful. Early intervention is working fairly well within Northern Ireland. But there is a gap, because not all children are diagnosed&#151;identified may be a better word&#151;at an early age. With nine to 18 year-olds, to chose an arbitrary period, there is a huge gap.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Young people in the home, with parents who want to do the best for them, may have such behavioural problems that it is an exceedingly difficult task. There is no one for children at that age to whom the parents can turn. There are no properly trained nurses to go out to the homes to give on the spot advice on how those young people can be catered for. That is a very sad and trying situation for families who encounter that difficulty. Will the Minister indicate where, within the budgetary facilities that are being discussed here today, there is planning to provide resources to fill that gap for the nine to 18 year-old autistic young people who have been missed out in the past?

We come back here every year and say the same things or a variation on the same things, and, to be honest, I have not seen one single major benefit come out of our long discussions. That is not just because the Government do not listen. We inevitably get changes in Ministers and changes of emphasis, and we are always waiting for the next step forward&#151;for September, when we either will or will not get an Assembly back.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>There has been far too much inactivity through the Ministers, who are the only people who can action anything. I am not accusing them of being useless, or of anything like that. We have had some excellent Ministers; in fact, the more excellent they are, the quicker they are moved, which is also a problem. We seriously need somebody to get a grip on the infrastructure, as the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, was saying. That is not simple, but someone must get a grip on it, stop talking about it and stop looking at it as if it were something to be handed back next week or next month. I wish those issues could have been handed back so quickly, but we were talking about &quot;next week or next month&quot; in 1971 and 1972, and we are still talking about it.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, referred to the region being as big as Hampshire or Dorset&#151;and there are other very big counties in England. The Committee should consider the number of health boards, education boards and cross-border groups&#151;which I am not against; it should consider the number of cross-border organisations, such as Waterways Ireland, the Rivers Agency, the Loughs Agency and so on. I shall tell the Committee where the cost goes: it goes because nobody has settled down, got a grip on things and made a decision.

<a name="40720-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>There have been numerous consultations about what to do with the health service, with regard to the boards, and what to do with the number of education and library boards. We even had one on the water system, considering the issue of fluoride. To be honest, the options have been there, and the governments of the day&#151;and this happened with the Conservatives, too, so the issue is not about Labour&#151;have simply sidelined the issues. While they continue to do that, we will be back next year with exactly the same problem.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>With Waterways Ireland and the Rivers Agency, for example, things are in a complete muddle. I can tell Members of the Committee that, because there is an incidence of that confusion down on Lough Erne. People do not know where the dividing line is between the two bodies. I was not going to mention this matter, but now I shall: there is a jetty at the Share Centre for handicapped people, on public ground. It was put up about 20 years ago, and it is now too dangerous to use. I have been on to Waterways Ireland, which has &#163;7 million that it did not spend, but it absolutely refuses to move on the matter. I know that that body will say that it is consulting, because it told me that, and I have goodness knows how many letters. I have been on to the Rivers Agency, which said that the matter was nothing to do with it.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>That is bureaucracy of the highest order. With Waterways Ireland in Fermanagh in particular, I know a lot of people working in that region who say that the body is simply not allowed to produce policy within the system under their present leadership. That leadership has no interest whatever in being in Fermanagh&#151;it was moved from Dublin.
</p>

<a name="40720-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I can promise the Committee that the expenditure that we are discussing today is controlled by bureaucracy because nobody will get a grip on things. The sooner that someone gets a grip on things, the sooner we can sort things out.

</p>

<a name="40720-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I used the example of education because it was easier to get hold of the figure. There is a &#163;1,300 million spend on it in Northern Ireland.

<a name="40720-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fitt: </b>   I rise briefly to support the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, in his expression of optimism in relation to Northern Ireland. Prior to his speaking, I heard voices from the past, since the Northern Ireland state came into being. When the state came into being, there have been people in charge of affairs who always want to wear the mantle of victimhood. There was someone always against them.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I have sat in previous Northern Ireland parliaments and there was a time when the Catholic minority, the nationalist minority, felt that they were the victims. Now that that has been changed, to a large extent the Unionist Party feels that it is the victim. As I have listened today, I have felt like supporting the Government in what they decide to do in Northern Ireland. The state that exists there now has not been brought about by the British Government; it has been brought about by the Northern Ireland electorate, electing people they supported. For example, no one cast a vote to send all of us here today. Those who were politicians may have been voted for, but no one cast a vote to send us here. I know that in Northern Ireland, as in other parts of the United Kingdom, there is a revulsion at the very existence of this place.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was right when a few weeks ago he put all the Northern Ireland orders he had received that morning on the Dispatch Box. I find it absolutely impossible to contend with all the paraphernalia that we receive from the Northern Ireland Office. No one, and particularly an individual such as myself, could possibly deal with every aspect of the legislation contained therein. It is different for the Unionist Party. Members of the Ulster Unionist Party here have secretarial assistance.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>We criticise many aspects of what the Government are doing in relation to legislation in Northern Ireland; for example, these orders. We have a half-time Assembly in Northern Ireland. Before these orders were printed, did the Northern Ireland Office have discussions with the elected representatives to the Northern Ireland Assembly? Did it ask for their opinion? The representatives are on some sort of a wage and they can say that they were the latest people to have felt the support of the Northern Ireland electorate.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The orders have been drawn up possibly by civil servants. In the absence of an Assembly and the opinions of the Members, it must be left to civil servants. There is no other way of legislating for every-day happenings in Northern Ireland. By the way, I think that the Anti-social Behaviour Order and the Dangerous Wild Animals Order could be combined.

They can say that they sought the opinions of the electors. The two main political parties in control of Northern Ireland are not represented here.

Now, to translate that into language that we understand, how does one get a grip on things? We have an Assembly in Northern Ireland that does not want to get a grip on anything. The members of the Assembly will be the people who should be taking decisions on these orders and will be, we hope, in September.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Again, I can hear voices from the past, particularly that of the noble Lord, Lord Laird. The political developments that have taken place in the wake of the   Good Friday Agreement&#151;the cross-border agreements&#151;are not to the taste of everybody in Northern Ireland. Quite a lot of people in Northern Ireland see the cross-border agreements as being some form of concession to Sinn Fein, to the total exclusion of the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>So what should we concentrate on before we begin to unravel and understand most of this? I think we should concentrate on trying to get the Assembly in Northern Ireland re-established. The people to talk to are not us. We have no influence in the streets and byways of Northern Ireland. The groups who should be talked to, if we can talk to them, are Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party. They hold the key to political progress in Northern Ireland. Aside from all the talking that we do here and the well-intentioned remarks that we make, it is those two political parties.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>By the way, did the Government talk to the SDLP or any other political party in Northern Ireland on these orders before they put them into print? If they did not, they should have. I do not believe that any criticism of the Northern Ireland Civil Service is justified. We have a civil service that has served the community in Northern Ireland well over many troublesome years. They are in this position now because there is no one else to accept the responsibility that they have to accept in relation to the promulgation of these orders. I can only advise the Leader of the House, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40720-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   The noble Lord referred to me in his speech. I wish to make the point that it is not that I, as an Ulster Unionist, am opposed to cross-border bodies, because it is quite something to have had a chairman of a cross-border body from the Ulster Unionist party. It is not that. It is that the cross-border bodies do not operate fairly. If they operated fairly, I would be totally in support of them. I am not a voice from the past. I am a great supporter and admirer of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, and his acumen for explaining things. However, I wish to clarify my position for the Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40720-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I could not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, more about relieving all of us of the burden of considering these orders in the detail that we must. I entirely agree with the sentiments that have been expressed in Grand Committee this afternoon and I share the regret that has been expressed by noble Lords that we have to consider these orders this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Members of the Committee will be well aware that we have been focusing on trying to reach agreement. We have urged the party to maintain its engagement over the summer. The Committee will also be aware that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have said that efforts need to be made to step up the dialogue and discussions so that we can try to come to a resolution.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I thank Members of the Committee for recognising that responding to today&#039;s debate will be something of a Herculean task. I shall do my best. The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, asked questions about whether political parties had been consulted on the budget order. I can assure him that they were consulted.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I shall start by addressing some of the more general points that have been made before moving on to the specific points. I shall start with some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, with respect to the Barnett formula and so forth, before going on to some of the issues about efficiency that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and others.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The Barnett formula represents the mechanism for determining changes to the devolved budget. Thus, there is no difference between the resources that come through Barnett and other resources that are allocated to local ministries in order to address spending priorities in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord   Shutt, raised some specific points about the detail of the estimates, particularly the additionality of EU funds. The allocation of EU funds is factored into the sums set out in the estimates. The additionality of funds is validated by the Treasury to ensure that the full draw down is achieved.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Regarding EU moneys more generally, it is important to appreciate that those estimates are a financial statement. The allocations made by various <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

EU bodies are fully reported on in the various EU monitoring committee reports that are produced annually. Of course, that is a requirement by the European Commission auditors.

</p>

<a name="40720-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, spoke about efficiency duplication, the efficiency review and bureaucracy in some detail, but it was also raised by the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Molyneaux and others. On the efficiency review, we are committed to at least matching the efficiency targets. In numerical terms, that means achieving efficiency gains in excess of &#163;500 million by 2007&#150;08. In addition, administration costs will be held at the 2005&#150;06 levels for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08.

</p>

<a name="40720-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Some initial work has been undertaken. Members of the Committee will be pleased to learn that the rationalisation of back-office functions, such as finance and personnel, is a key area where savings can be delivered. The ongoing review of public administration addresses the relative costs of running Northern Ireland,   which is an issue raised particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough. The work includes benchmarking the costs of producing health and education with comparable areas in England and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The use of consultants exercises the noble Lord, Lord   Smith of Clifton. The recent audit office report into the employment of consultants by Northern Ireland departments of course identified some shortcomings in procedures and recording systems. But the report also acknowledged the significant pressures that exist with the introduction of devolution, the creation of the four new departments and the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting. As I think that I made clear to the noble Lord when this was raised on the Floor of the House in a Starred Question, we are of course looking at the recommendations in that report in order to put them into effect.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, raised the broader question of consultation and the quality of that consultation, and more general concerns were raised by Members of the Committee. We carry out consultation precisely because it is important that we find out and understand what communities want. But Members of the Committee also need to recognise that we have a statutory requirement, under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, to carry out consultation. So it is something that the Government think is important, but it is also a statutory requirement.

<a name="40720-40_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The issue of public administration was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. The review was launched in 2002 and the noble Lord was concerned about where we have got to with it. It is the most far-reaching examination ever of how public services in Northern Ireland are organised and delivered and aims to deliver a more effective and efficient system of public administration to the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para21"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC89</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the proposed reform will inevitably require a lengthy implementation phase, which will allow sufficient time for a return to devolution and for the local executive to influence the final outcome. Yesterday, my honourable friend Ian Pearson announced his view that a reduction in the number of district councils and health bodies would be appropriate. That, of course, will be a key issue for the consultation process.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, also raised absenteeism. As a result of a recent PAC report, DFP has issued to all departments a new circular that puts in place a robust monitoring system which will address the problem at a much earlier stage through a trigger-point system. That will bring about a measurable improvement. The noble Lord also asked for the statistics relating to 2003&#150;04. Those statistics are not yet available, but when they are I shall ensure that the noble Lord has a copy of them.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>As regards the pay dispute, I recognise that the dispute is having an impact on particular key services and is causing not only inconvenience but also some hardship to the public. We are working hard to secure an early settlement in order to return public services to their usual high standard. Last week, the management side presented a number of proposals to the trade union in an effort to break the deadlock. For its part, the trade union also tabled some proposals, which are being considered by the management side.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>However, talks between management of the Civil Service and representatives of the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance were adjourned by the trade union at lunchtime last Friday. That was because the trade union indicated that it did not believe that it could reach a settlement of the dispute on the basis of the overall pay remit set by the Government for the negotiations. The trade union has now sought an early meeting with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to seek to have the pay remit figure increased for the Northern Ireland Civil Service. That request is now being considered and an early response will be sent to the trade union.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>On the more specific point of the impact that that dispute is having on the payments of subsidies and grants, NIPSA called a strike for administrative staff   in payments branch, Orchard House, Derry/Londonderry. While the strike started on 12 March, on 6 July more than half of the staff taking part in the industrial action returned to work. The return to work of those staff will help the departments concentrate on priority work areas and, in particular, those cases where payments have been delayed due to queries.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Despite the strike action, the Department for Agricultural and Rural Development has made many of the subsidy balance payments now due. The amount of subsidy processed since 12 May stands at &#163;39.8   million. Around &#163;20 million remains to be paid. That largely reflects query and penalty cases that have failed the automated cross-checks. Action is in hand to process those cases so that the majority of the still outstanding payments can be processed over the coming days.

<a name="40720-40_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, also raised concerns about what is happening to the health service in Northern Ireland. There is a regional programme of work being taken forward in 2004&#150;05 to examine how pressures on hospitals can be eased.
</p>

<a name="40720-40_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>A number of Members of the Committee raised questions about education. The noble Lords, Lord Glentoran, Lord Laird and Lord Maginnis, asked specific questions in relation to the review of post-primary education. I know that there are very strongly held and diverse views about academic selection in Northern Ireland. However, change is unavoidable. There are weaknesses in our current arrangements that must be addressed. The decline in pupil numbers cannot be ignored.

</p>

<a name="40720-40_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The Government&#039;s review of post-primary education will build on the strengths of the current system offering both choice and flexibility and will provide all pupils with education that they see as relevant to their needs. All schools, including grammar schools, can have a place under the new arrangements. But those offering a traditional academic emphasis must also offer people access to a guaranteed minimum number of vocational courses.

<a name="40720-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Does she not find it somewhat strange that at a time when this new Labour Government have abandoned the idea of turning grammar schools in Great Britain into comprehensive schools and have declared that they have no further ambition in that direction, they now seek to undermine the element within education in Northern Ireland that has been a huge success over so many years?
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Is it not inappropriate that the Government have no idea of the number of teacher or pupil hours that would be involved in moving children or teachers from one school to another? They just have not bothered to find out the impact of the Costello report. That is the difficulty we have. We believe that our educational system can stand on its own feet because it is a good system, but it is being destroyed without any pre-planning.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I do not agree with the noble Lord. He is not right when he talks about the Government abandoning plans in England and Wales where they have made absolutely clear that they want to achieve a balance between flexibility and choice, which is what they want to achieve in Northern Ireland as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   That means nothing.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   No, I do not agree with that. It does not mean nothing. It means that the Government are seeking to ensure that we have a system that puts excellence at the heart but which, at the same time, meets the needs of all pupils. To do that, we recognise that we must have a range of provisions. In my earlier comments, I made absolutely clear that all schools,   including grammar schools, can have a place under the new arrangements. Those schools offering a traditional academic emphasis will also need to offer a guaranteed minimum number of vocational courses.

</p>

<a name="40720-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>If the noble Lord has looked at the education system in England and Wales he will know that in seeking to encourage specialisation in city academies some 10 per cent of pupils are drawn through selection. That is part of the method to enhance excellence and to draw people in from a wider area while, at the same, encouraging excellence in a local school. That mix of choice, flexibility and excellence is precisely what we would also like to see in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>As regards the Department for Education provision, the budget includes &#163;3.2 million for the review of post-primary education in order to provide for ongoing groundwork to support implementation of revised arrangements. The questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, with respect to the   knowledge that we have of what currently exists will be picked up through that review. But it will not be possible to estimate the total cost of those arrangements until decisions begin to emerge at a local level.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The issue of integrated education was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Kilclooney, and my noble friend Lord Dubs. The noble Baroness, Lady   Blood, made her view of what is happening at a local level absolutely clear. Integrated education is accorded the highest priority, but long-term planning of schools infrastructure needs to consider factors, such as rapidly-falling birth rates. Such factors have significant influences on school building provision.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Regarding the specific question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Laird, about works for the schools estate, the order contains a specific provision of &#163;26 million for minor works to improve the schools estate, including the removal of temporary classrooms and improved access for those with disabilities. That is in addition to the already substantial planned investment in the schools estate. On 27 April my honourable friend Barry Gardiner announced an investment programme covering 43 schools, including the funding of 12 schools through public/private partnership.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, asked about children with autistic spectrum disorder and the noble Lord, Lord Laird, mentioned a specific case which, of course, I cannot address here. I understand that there will be an additional &#163;0.5 million allocated to develop diagnostic assessment and early support services in 2004&#150;05. The establishment of multi-disciplinary diagnostic and assessment teams will reduce waiting times for diagnosis and provide initial support for parents.

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>DHSSPS is working closely with the Department for Education to implement the recommendations in the task group report on the education of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorder and on the establishment of a centre of excellence in autism at Middletown.

<a name="40720-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about the student numbers cap. Currently, the Department for Employment and Learning is carrying out a public consultation exercise on the Higher Education Bill. The Minister with responsibility for employment and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC92"></a>

learning will wish to consider the issue of removing any cap on student numbers as part of that consultation exercise.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to planning. I fully appreciate the concerns raised by Members of the Committee on that issue. I would also point out that the planning service is now in its second   year of a three-year programme to deliver fundamental reforms to the planning system. A number of key issues have already been addressed. Further significant progress will be achieved over the next six months.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. I only made the point in relation to the strike. Had I been making some points about the planning service, I would have had to have declared an interest: I have had an application in for two-and-a-half years. That is why I stayed away from that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for that clarification. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, raised some concerns about the underspend in certain programmes and the Strategic Investment Board. Of &#163;220 million of departmental underspend, some &#163;157   million relates to slippage in capital programmes. I know that raises some bigger questions about why there has been that degree of slippage in capital programmes, but all of us will recognise that it is very unusual for a capital programme not to experience slippage.

<a name="40720-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The Strategic Investment Board was established in April last year to facilitate the development of key infrastructure programmes.

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I turn to the railways, an issue which I know is of concern to many noble Lords. It was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Shutt, Lord Laird and Lord Kilclooney, and my noble friend Lord Dubs. Closure of the railways on the non-core lines is only one option which is still out for consultation. Ministers need to take on board all the options and consider the economic, social and environmental impact in the wider budgetary context. Noble Lords will recognise that we need to address a number of pressing issues. The consultation exercise follows a statutory requirement and will conclude on 23 July. We will of course have to ensure that we achieve maximum value for money.

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>On the issue of investment in the roads, a matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, the funding allocated to the road service as part of the regional transportation strategy will see significant improvements on the major roads mentioned by the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Concerns were also expressed by the noble Lords, Lord Laird and Lord Kilclooney, about the cost of the civic forum. The provision in the order is for the full-year costs of the body. The figure quoted for previous <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

years reflects actual costs during suspension, hence the apparent increase. We all hope that suspension will cease, so the approach we have taken in the budget is consistent with our wish for an early restoration of devolution. In the event that the resources are not needed by the civic forum, they will be reallocated to other priority areas. So I can reassure noble Lords that the money will not simply be allocated and then not spent. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, also spoke of the wider role of the civic forum. That will form part of the review and of the talks.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about funding for the North/South bodies. Indeed, the noble Lord has written to me on many occasions about this matter. All budgets for North/South bodies are agreed jointly by the government of both the North and the South. The 2004 budgets for each of the bodies have now been jointly agreed. Under current arrangements, North/South bodies are required to operate on a care and maintenance basis only and, in this context, budget proposals should not include any substantive development costs. I am well aware of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, about the level of the budget allocated for the Ulster Scots Agency in 2004. He has tabled a number of Written Questions on the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40720-41_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   When the noble Baroness says that the budgets have been &quot;agreed&quot;, with whom have they been agreed? One of the planks of the current political process in Northern Ireland is consultation. I believe in consultation since I will talk to anyone about almost anything. But no discussion or agreement has taken place between the agency, the implementation bodies, the language body and both governments. That is the point I cannot understand.
</p>

<a name="40720-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>As for care and maintenance, the language body seems to be the only one to suffer this business of care and maintenance. Waterways Ireland is to have a 40   per cent increase in its budget for the year 2004. It seems rather unfair that we should be the only body to suffer from care and maintenance. It is not a case of taking new territories. The Ulster Scots Agency was seeking to continue with a policy which it has now had to stop.

<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40720-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I think that the noble Lord and I will have to agree to disagree on this point. I have written to the noble Lord on a number of occasions setting out the consultation which has taken place and the fact that the relevant sponsoring departments have agreed this budget. I am aware that the noble Lord then requested the minutes of meetings which were held. I have explained to the noble Lord in the form of a Written Answer that under data protection legislation it is not possible to supply those minutes. Given that, I think that we will have to disagree. Although I have written to the noble Lord a number of times, it is clear that he does not accept the explanations I have given.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Perhaps I may repeat that the relevant sponsoring departments have agreed that the current budget allocation is an appropriate amount to meet the agency&#039;s basic care and maintenance needs for 2004.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40720-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   Again, agreed with whom? As a former chairman of the body, not to get access to minutes to prove that there was consultation seems somewhat unusual. There was no consultation in the sense of a discussion about policy. There was a telephone call to tell the agency what would be its budget and what had been agreed with the Irish. In my opinion, that does not constitute consultation, discussion or agreement. I cannot understand why, when policies were working successfully last year, they were not allowed to continue. If there was a good reason for their not being allowed to continue, if someone had a better policy, we should have liked to have heard about it. But to do that without discussion, consultation or agreement is crass in the extreme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40720-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   Perhaps I can remind the noble Lord that no money was taken away from the Ulster-Scots Agency. The agency received a year-on-year increase. It was not as high as the agency wanted, but many organisations find themselves in that situation. When they receive a year-on-year increase, they make decisions about their priorities. That is all that I can tell the Committee at this point. I am happy to maintain my correspondence with the noble Lord on that point, but I must tell him that I can add nothing further to what I have already said.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a> On the issue of minutes, again, I made clear to the noble Lord in a Written Answer on 23 April that, under Part 2, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which covers internal discussion and advice, it would be inappropriate for the Government to disclose documentation relating to discussions on the budget for the language body.

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40720-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   Perhaps I am slow on the uptake, but I should like the Minister to explain in more detail because I genuinely fail to understand how access to minutes of a public body can come under the scope of data protection to the extent that the democratic process can be undermined so that public representatives in this and another place do not have access to the minutes relating to the functioning of a public body. I fail to understand.

If there is an internal discussion between the body and its parent department&#151;Members of the Committee who have operated in public bodies will understand this&#151;that is a matter of internal discussion and advice, which then goes to Ministers and is not in the public domain. There is no problem here. There is no other body in which that is recognised as being a problem.

Research Group. Staff from the secretariat, acting in their capacity as officials of the Irish Government and OFMDFM, have helped to facilitate meetings between members of the Ulster Political Research Group as part of the overall policy of community engagement endorsed by the British and Irish Governments. No other support or funding has been provided by the Government.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a> The noble Lord also raised the issue of funding for festivals. Review of funding for festivals has been undertaken to inform future strategy for government support of festivals. The report has been considered by Ministers and a policy and guidance framework based on the report&#039;s recommendations is being developed.

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked specifically about the removal of industrial derating. We have discussed the topic before in Grand Committee. I remind the noble Lord that firms will have had more than eight years from when the policy decision to remove industrial derating was first announced to prepare for the payment of full rates.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a> Finally, two other matters were raised. The first was the issue of economic inequalities between the north and the south, also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney. The Republic of Ireland economy has indeed grown dramatically during the past decade but it was starting from a very low base. It has also had fiscal and monetary autonomy, which Northern Ireland does not have, but the main economic indicators in both north and south are still heading in the same, favourable direction. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised the specific issue of working to help those who want to cease a life of violence. I shall have to write to him on that.

<a name="40720-42_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Anti-social Behaviour (Northern Ireland) Order 2004</h3>

<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="40720-42_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40720-42_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Anti-social Behaviour (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The proposals contained in the draft Anti-social Behaviour (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 represent measures to protect the public from behaviour which causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. The proposals focus on the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders. They form part of a wider range of measures, including restorative and rehabilitative responses, with the aim of ensuring that the justice system responds appropriately to behaviour which can blight communities and that people in Northern Ireland can enjoy a quality of life that is not ruined by fear of anti-social behaviour.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Anti-social behaviour is a matter of concern to the people of Northern Ireland. The 2001 Northern Ireland Crime Survey reported that more than half of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those who responded felt that anti-social behaviour had increased in their area in the previous two years. Fear can have a very disabling effect, particularly for those who are older or more vulnerable, but it is important to note that in this survey younger respondents felt anti-social behaviour to be even more of a problem than those who were older.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The Government fully believe that we must now address the issue legislatively. That decision is informed by findings in Northern Ireland and evidence from practice elsewhere. In June last year, an anti-social behaviour count day in Northern Ireland recorded 3,150 incidents of anti-social behaviour.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>In a study commissioned by the Scottish Executive to monitor the use of ASBOs, 62 per cent of local authorities who responded reported a perceived improvement in the behaviour of those given ASBOs. In Manchester, available evidence shows that 60 per cent of those who have ASBOs have not been prosecuted at all, either for breach or for any other offence.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Innovative ways of using ASBOs in England and Wales&#151;for example, in dealing with the blight of illegal advertising&#151;have been recognised in a recent survey by the environmental group, Tidy Northern Ireland, which identified areas where graffiti and illegal advertising were a significant problem.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Anti-social behaviour orders were introduced in England and Wales in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The provisions were added to by the Police Reform Act 2002, which gave criminal courts the power to issue an ASBO on conviction of a criminal offence and increased the number of bodies that could make application, and, most recently, by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. Among other things, it provided that on ASBOs made on conviction, evidence used does not have to have been admissible in the proceedings in which the offender was convicted.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>In April 2002, a consultation paper was published by the then Secretary of State on community safety in Northern Ireland. Issues identified that needed to be addressed included street violence, low-level neighbourhood disorder and anti-social behaviour. The resultant Community Safety Strategy published in March 2003 identified that anti-social behaviour legislation in England and Wales needed to be examined to see if it was appropriate for Northern Ireland. In the context of the findings in Northern Ireland and evidence from elsewhere, this draft legislation is brought forward.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Most respondents supported what the Government aimed to do. There were concerns from organisations involved with children. The points that they made were considered very carefully, and, as a result of the consultations, the Government included in the draft order the provision for courts to have discretion with regard to reporting restrictions for young people. The wording of the legislation clarifies that, where reporting restrictions are applied, they cover the whole application from start to finish.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40720-42_time1"></a><h5>5.45 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="40720-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The Government concluded that, in the interests of the protection of all in the community, it was necessary to bring forward this legislation for consideration. It is worth noting that an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the consultation and the process that the Government followed, brought by the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, was refused. Indeed, the High Court found &quot;no arguable case&quot; for any of the arguments put before it.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>It is essential in Northern Ireland that there is a partnership approach to dealing with anti-social behaviour. The draft order allows initially for three partners: the police, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and district councils. Partnership involving the Housing Executive allows the use of ASBOs without conviction to deal with anti-social behaviour in housing estates where the Housing Executive is the major landlord. Partnership involving district councils will allow anti-social behaviour relating to noise pollution, enforcement of byelaws and licensing laws to be targeted. It may be possible for other bodies to become partners in future, just as the range of partner bodies in England and Wales has expanded.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The draft order provides for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders as a statutory measure in Northern Ireland. It provides that where there is no associated conviction, the police, the relevant district council or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive would be able to seek an ASBO on application to a magistrates&#039; court in respect of anti-social behaviour. It also provides that ASBOs may be made on conviction in criminal proceedings where the court is satisfied that the convicted person has acted in an anti-social manner and that an ASBO is necessary to protect persons within Northern Ireland from further anti-social acts by him. It further provides that breach of an ASBO would be a criminal offence subject to a penalty of up to five years&#039; imprisonment or a fine or both.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The proposals will form part of the wider range of tools to deal with this kind of behaviour and it is important to note that the Criminal Justice Review proposed a range of restorative and rehabilitative responses to low level crime which are being implemented, including youth conferencing and the police&#039;s youth diversion scheme, which involves restorative cautioning for young people under 17.
</p>

<a name="40720-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The measures proposed here do not aim to replace existing measures but to complement them. It is essential that the Government send a clear message that anti-social behaviour is not acceptable and that there are effective sanctions if people choose to act in this way. The Government&#039;s aim is to continue to build a safe and tolerant society for all the people of Northern Ireland. I commend the draft order to the Grand Committee.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40720-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council for so clearly laying out the order. In passing, I thank her for her patience and clarity in responding to our previous debate.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Reading <i>Hansard</i> from another place, I noticed that David Trimble said that he was surprised that Northern Ireland had waited six years for ASBOs. First, I want to make it quite clear that my party welcomes ASBOs as another weapon in the judicial armoury. There are many areas and occasions in Northern Ireland when ASBOs will be of value.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>However, I am concerned that it could take up to three months from application to the delivery an order. Given how I see ASBOs being used in Northern Ireland, with younger people and in relation to unruliness in accommodation, and so on, the need is pretty urgent when such situations arise. Indeed, a certain friend of mine was having a terrible time with the people above him in a Housing Executive apartment, with banging, thumping and crashing at night causing a huge amount of noise. He could not get anyone, including the Housing Executive, to do anything, and ultimately went to the paramilitaries. That was very successful; it only took a few weeks. That is rather like the cynical, sad story that on the Shankill and Falls roads at one time you could get a divorce for &#163;250.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I hope that the efficiency of delivery of ASBOs will be better than three months from the time of request. I should also like reassurance from the noble Baroness that the order will bring Northern Ireland up to date and in line with the legislation in Great Britain: the Police Reform Act 2002 and the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. I hope that the order incorporates the 1998, 2002 and 2003 Acts.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>On a slightly more negative note&#151;although I do not mean to be negative about ASBOs&#151;I should like some information about what the attendant bureaucracy will cost in sterling, but more importantly in time, especially police time. I should not like to think that this is going to be another heavy bureaucratic load on the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could enlighten me a little on that, especially as I know that the Government are continually looking for reasons to reduce policing in Northern Ireland. We do not want to introduce another heavy bureaucratic load on the police service when we are talking about having to reduce the level of policing.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>However, on the whole, my party welcomes ASBOs. We hope that the Northern Ireland system will allow them to be delivered and used far more effectively than, I understand, they have been in other parts of the United Kingdom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40720-43_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I, too, thank the noble Baroness for setting out the parameters of ASBOs. We, too, accept that there is increasing cause for concern because of the fear that loutish behaviour can <br>&nbsp;<br>

cause. I have seen a great improvement in the environment in Northern Ireland since I was last there five years ago. I am sure that that helps to counter the worst forms of anti-social behaviour. If people have a nice environment, they tend to behave better.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>As we have heard, we have had legislation in England since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and it has taken a long time for that to be initiated in Ireland. Groups in Northern Ireland have significant funds distributed to them of about &#163;3.3 million to solve locally the problems of anti-social behaviour. Of course, there are ways of dealing with anti-social behaviour other than slapping on orders, and I shall refer to them in a moment. Indeed, the Criminal Justice Review talked of other measures, such as restorative justice, as a means of dealing more productively with low-level crime.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The preference on our Benches would be to implement acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) before dashing for an ASBO. They have been a success in places such as Islington. If the Committee will allow me, I shall give it an idea of how they have worked there. ABCs, as I shall call them, are voluntary agreements between young people, their parents or carer, and the agencies involved&#151;perhaps landlords, the police, schools, social worker and so on&#151;that certain behaviour is unacceptable and that the young person will stop it.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Their behaviour is monitored over six months and, if the ABC is breached, there are a number of possibilities, from moving to a notice seeking possession of the home, to an ASBO or extending the ABC to some other measure, such as referral to a youth offending team. They are highly effective, quick and cheap to implement, and they involve the community around the young people, supporting them to reform, rather than labelling them as bad.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The good points about ABCs as opposed to ASBOs are that they do not involve the courts, so they are a more practical option for local authorities that want to take quick, cost-effective action, and they are not a step on the criminal justice ladder for the young person involved. They require agencies to work together, which is essential in tackling the issues surrounding anti-social behaviour. As ABCs are voluntary and offender-centred, they require the young person to take responsibility for, and to tackle, their behaviour, and get them appropriate support. Different solutions are found in each case rather than taking a blanket approach&#151;for example, curfews may not be the right answer if the problem is noise from within the home. As ABCs are voluntary, they need to be imposed, so no evidence chain is required. They can be used to nip trouble in the bud rather than waiting for the serious offending that requires an ASBO.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Part of the acceptable behaviour contract is monitoring by appropriate agencies, such as the police, landlords and schools, which can itself be the   evidence-gathering necessary for an ASBO, should the ABC fail. Even if people favour ASBOs, they can use ABCs in the interim. Far from being a soft option on anti-social behaviour, the ABC initiative <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shows that the contracts work. They have been endorsed by the Home Office as a national model. I wonder whether this will be part of the proposals that the Government have in mind. Perhaps the Minister will consider extending the scheme to Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Minister has explained how ASBOs will be delivered in Northern Ireland. Will the police become involved only with orders in relation to formal criminal prosecutions? Will the Housing Executive become involved only in relation to activities within public housing estates? Will district councils become involved with ASBOs only in relation to their own property, such as parks, or as part of their jurisdiction on noise pollution?
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The Liberal Democrats do not oppose ASBOs in principle, but we have some concerns about the circumstances in which they can be used and the level of seriousness of offence before an order is made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40720-43_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Blood: </b>   I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this order. First, let me say that nobody in Northern Ireland is opposed to a measure that will bring some form of law and order to our Province. Lawlessness is rife in Northern Ireland; it must be looked at and attended to with great urgency. But I have some concerns with the order in its present form in Northern Ireland. I want to raise six points, on which I will be as brief as possible.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The noble Baroness has already referred to the judicial case involving the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People. That raises some concerns. The commissioner&#039;s office was approached by almost all the leading children&#039;s organisations in Northern Ireland. They expressed concerns about the speed with which the measures were introduced in Northern Ireland and the fact that there was inadequate consultation. To my mind, the issues raised by the commissioner&#039;s office have not been responded to satisfactorily by the Government. I received an e-mail yesterday from the Northern Ireland Rights Commission, which has received no response to date, about which it is very disappointed.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I have a major concern that the ability in Northern Ireland to &quot;name and shame&quot; children raises many issues. It makes them very vulnerable to paramilitary punishment beatings. As many noble Lords know, I have worked in this area for many years. I would be very concerned that a measure such as an ASBO would be used against a child, whose name would become public knowledge, with the result that they would be the victim of paramilitarism or displaced to another area.

</p>

<a name="40720-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>As we have already discussed, public housing in Northern Ireland is mainly provided by one body: the Housing Executive. We all know that housing in Northern Ireland is split along sectarian lines. I travelled to America two years ago to look at how displacement was dealt with there. They had a displacement policy whereby if someone in a neighbourhood was bad, they were moved on to the next one. That is fine if there are more than 100 neighbourhoods. But in the area in which I live, there are six neighbourhoods. I would be very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerned if an order was made against a young person and he was moved on. I cannot see that working. I raised the matter with the Minister in the other place and he assured me that it would work. From my knowledge on the ground, I cannot see how it would work, because if a young person is named and shamed and has to move on, that would probably mean that his entire family would have to move on.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I am a member of a health and social services health board. We have had paramilitary people circulating the names of young people who have had to be taken into our facilities for safekeeping. I am really worried that this aspect of the ASBO legislation raises the issue of putting the names of children over the age of 10 into the public domain. That could mean the destruction of their education and of the whole family in the housing. I am talking mainly about Housing Executive estates.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>One of my biggest concerns is the question of who will police this. We are continually told that the PSNI is stretched to capacity. I am inundated by people ringing me to say that they called the police to be told that there was no manpower and that no one was available, and who were asked whether they could wait. I have had pensioners ring me about burglaries where they have had to wait three days for a response. I wonder who will be the leading light who will come in and scoop up all these young people. There is a real problem with young people on the streets of some of the big cities in Northern Ireland who are causing major concerns. I am worried about who will police it.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>In Northern Ireland, as in the United Kingdom, it is a criminal offence to drop litter. We have signs all over the place and yet we have a huge litter problem. I drove through the main parade area on 12 July and my car felt like a tank, it was pushing so much litter in front of it. Hundreds of tonnes of litter were dropped and I do not know of anyone who was charged. If one goes around Belfast one will see why it is getting a name as a dirty city. Litter is being dropped everywhere, even though we have huge signs saying that offenders can be prosecuted. But, to my knowledge, no one has ever been charged. Similarly, we have a byelaw in Northern Ireland saying that people cannot drink in certain public places. That law is flouted daily, sometimes within sight of the PSNI. I have seen it myself. But no charges have ever been made.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>My main concern about this order is naming and shaming children and bringing their names into the public domain. In Northern Ireland that can be an extremely dangerous thing to do. We are doing a lot of work within our communities on restorative justice and are trying to bring children and young people in and give them a different outlook on life. I am worried that they will be criminalised by this.
</p>

<a name="40720-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>My other big problem with this order is who is going to police it. We are told that the police are already stretched. Are we going to recruit some of the community police that we heard about yesterday? In the United Kingdom, 20,000 community police are to be recruited. If that is the case, it is grand. I am all for patrols going round my area taking up the people who are causing all the trouble.

<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40720-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Fitt: </b>   I associate myself with the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Blood. I made some facetious reference to this order earlier. On reading it today, I think that it will be very difficult to implement it in certain areas and estates in Northern Ireland. Let us take the example of a young boy who is creating mayhem in an estate such as Ballymurphy or Turf Lodge, defying the wishes of the people on that estate, and whose father is a member of a paramilitary organisation. Is there any way in which an order can be implemented against the wishes of his father?
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Recently, the Northern Ireland papers were full of stories of the INLA, a paramilitary organisation, which had taken it upon itself to police Ardoyne. It was beating up young people in the area and accusing them of anti-social behaviour. Two or three of the young boys were so badly beaten up, terrified and harassed that they hanged themselves. The Northern Ireland papers were full of reports on the issue. The paramilitaries in those areas have taken it upon themselves to decide what types of activity will be permitted in the area.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, said that she feels that the legislation has come far too quickly given the situation in Northern Ireland. I wonder whether adequate discussion took place with the PSNI. Was it asked whether it was prepared to police this order and to deal with all its possible side effects? I cannot see members of the PSNI going into estates under the control of paramilitaries, some of which are loyalist and some of which are republican. It is a fact of life in Northern Ireland that the PSNI is totally excluded from those areas.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I noticed a detail about young boys harassing neighbours. The neighbours are at risk as well. If a young boy&#039;s mother complains to the local authority or the police, they can find themselves in extreme danger. The answer given to this is the same as all other times when we have discussed these matters: that there should be no &quot;no go&quot; areas in Northern Ireland. But we have to face the fact that there are &quot;no go&quot; areas in Northern Ireland. Young hooligans in them can get away with effective murder: seven young boys were beaten up by a paramilitary organisation, the INLA, in the Ardoyne area.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The noble Baroness asked for further discussion on the order before it is implemented. I support her expression of concern. I hope that it is possible to have further discussion that will make this order in any way acceptable in Northern Ireland.
</p>

noble friend that there would be much merit in postponing the implementation of the order until some of the detailed problems can be sorted out. There are three problems that I wish to mention.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned the time required to obtain an order. Perhaps there may be a solution to that in that I hope that an interim order can be obtained much more quickly than the full-blown one. Secondly, how will these orders relate to restorative justice? By that, I do not simply mean police cautioning. I am referring to matters such as voluntary agreements that have already been mentioned and the relationship between the person complained of and the youth offending team. Under the heading of restorative justice, it would be very good if some of those who have behaved in an anti-social way were involved in repairing the damage that they had done; for example, removing graffiti that they had put up. If they could also be brought to sufficient consideration of their behaviour, they would become willing to apologise to those who have suffered from it. Those are all forms of repairing and restoring the damage that individuals have caused.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Lastly, on matters relating to breaches of orders, I notice that these can involve imprisonment for up to six months. I question the effect of that in practice. It is a relatively short sentence and it is bound to disrupt the schooling of those who are still, in theory at least, attending school. What will be the impact on people aged 10 to 16? Will they be placed in youth custody centres? Have the Government thought through the question of the breach of orders?

<a name="40720-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I had prepared a question for the Minister about how ASBOs would be policed in paramilitary controlled areas. I did not put it because, while I am a great admirer of the noble Baroness, Lady   Blood, and have taken her advice on a number of occasions and will continue to do so, the whole of Northern Ireland is not a paramilitary area. There are many urban areas of Northern Ireland where ASBOs could be a useful adjunct to the judicial system. Of course, all members of the Committee understand that ASBOs would be almost impossible to use in certain areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40720-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I welcome the draft Anti-social Behaviour Order. I firmly support the measures taken against anti-social behaviour to restore stability to communities. The Ulster Unionist Party supports the protection of the human rights of young people, families and elderly people in communities throughout Northern Ireland whose lives have been blighted by anti-social behaviour. The Government must be less complacent about the problem of anti-social behaviour in Northern Ireland than it has been in the past six years. They must keep the working of the ASBOs in constant view and make promptly any changes that are required.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para6"></a>

example, an anti-social behaviour unit at the NIO as there is at the Home Office? I welcome the draft order. I consider it a step in the right direction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40720-44_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I thank the noble Lords who have spoken and welcome the positive comments that have been made about the need for anti-social behaviour orders, while recognising the concerns expressed.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, raised the issue of why this has taken so long. Members of the Committee will know that local authorities in England and Wales had powers in relation to housing, education, policing and other areas within their control that did not apply to district councils in Northern Ireland. It was therefore difficult to see how provisions in the 1998 order could map on to the Northern Ireland position. There was also a desire to see how these provisions operated in England and Wales. Picking up the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Laird, we wanted to learn from the experience of England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Changes have been made to the 1998 legislation by the Police Reform Act 2002 and, most recently, by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. In the light of these changes, the success of ASBOs in England and Wales and the fact that the community safety strategy that was published in March last year identified that the legislation in England and Wales needed to be examined to see whether it was appropriate for Northern Ireland, it was decided to bring forward legislation for Northern Ireland now to replicate the provisions for England and Wales in a form that reflects Northern Ireland&#039;s housing and local government structures.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="40720-44_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40720-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>It is important to note that in England and Wales practioners&#039; funding costs have gone down as they have gained experience in relation to anti-social behaviour orders. It is important to strike the right balance, avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy and having a robust process in place.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>On the issues around the difficulty of implementing this order in Northern Ireland&#151;the noble Lord, Lord   Fitt, and other Members of the Committee spoke about this&#151;an anti-social behaviour order does not require the consent of a child&#039;s parent for an order to be made. If a child who is the subject of an ASBO breaches the order, he or she would be liable for prosecution anywhere in Northern Ireland. The police in Northern Ireland are fully engaged in this process and are involved in the planning. All three partners can enforce an anti-social behaviour order.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about the use of police resources. Other Members of the Committee were also concerned about the impact of this on the PSNI. ASBOs can save police time, much of which is spent catching persistent offenders or, more particularly, dealing with the offences that they commit. Many offenders come to court with 100   appearances against their names. Taking those people out of their offending patterns, taking them out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the areas where they regularly commit offences, will enable the police to take action against them simply for being in an area or undertaking an activity from which they are barred. The police will not have to catch them committing an offence. That will save substantial amounts of police time and enable them to focus on driving down crime. In a recent survey, the PSNI found that 85 per cent of burglaries in south Belfast were carried out by 15 individuals. Dealing with those people and those patterns of behaviour will start to make a real change to the figures and to the crimes that add up to a host of human tragedies.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, was particularly concerned about the issue of enforcement, which was also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. It is not our view that we should not deal with anti-social behaviour because doing so would highlight the activities of youngsters who would gain unwelcome attention from paramilitaries. The argument that convictions highlight people&#039;s criminal activities could be made against the entire criminal code but it does not follow that we should abandon the criminal code. However, as a result of the consultation, we took on board the fact that, when appropriate, the court should be able to impose reporting restrictions in order to achieve an appropriate response to provide some degree of protection. I hope that that demonstrates that the consultation processes are valid.
</p>

<a name="40720-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady   Harris, about ABCs, they are written voluntary agreements between people involved in anti-social behaviour and authorities such as the police and housing departments. They were introduced in December 1999 in the Borough of Islington so they are a comparatively recent development. They are now widespread throughout police force areas in England and Wales. They are designed to complement ASBOs but have an attendant flexibility due to being voluntary. They do not require legislation. We hope that they will be taken on board with ASBOs rather than it being a matter of there being one or the other.
</p>

<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40720-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way. The point is that if ABCs are used in the first instance one does not have to put an ASBO on a bit later. I would prefer the encouragement of those being implemented rather than going the full stretch to an ASBO.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40720-45_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I recognise the point being made by the noble Baroness. It may be that in the case of the 15 individuals who I mentioned earlier, who are persistent offenders, ABCs are not appropriate. However, as a degree of prevention before young people get to the point where one has to use an ASBO, an ABC is appropriate. The point is that there are a number of tools in the armoury. There is a degree of flexibility, and a certain judgment is required about which is most appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I remind the Committee that these are civil orders, not criminal orders, although a breach of the order is a criminal offence. On the specific questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, the Housing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC106"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Executive will be able to use the orders against tenants and against private owners in areas where it is the chief landlord. District councils will be able to use them where there is anti-social behaviour in their areas.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, also asked whether councils would only get orders regarding their own properties. A council can apply if a property of an adjoining council is a problem. An ASBO can apply throughout the whole of Northern Ireland. In seeking an ASBO, identification will be made at that point about where it will apply. It can apply to the whole of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, raised a series of very important questions. Indeed, I would like to thank her for recognising that it is not an easy environment in which to work. That is why a number of noble Lords have welcomed what is being proposed here, despite the concerns that are being expressed. On the issue of the Human Rights Commission, I understand that it has had a meeting with officials on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>On the specific points raised by the noble Baroness, first, in relation to the challenge made by the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, I am, of course, aware that he sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Minister&#039;s decision to put this draft order before Parliament for approval. Both the applicant and the Government presented arguments. The commissioner failed to persuade Mr   Justice Girvan that there was an arguable case in any of the issues raised in support of the application for leave. This included the issues raised in relation to consultation. The issues raised were fully dealt with by Mr Justice Girvan in his judgment in the application for leave to apply for judicial review. In relation to consultation, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;A decision by the Minister to consult in the way in which he did could not be considered irrational or unlawful&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>On the issue of civil procedure, with its lesser safeguards, this is not the case. In a case, <i>Clingham and McCann</i>, the House of Lords accepted the justification and good sense of ASBOs, which are intended to protect the fundamental rights of the community that suffers from anti-social behaviour. ASBO procedures are subject to due process in court and the anti-social behaviour must be proven to the criminal standard, which was held by the House of Lords in <i>McCann.</i> Any proceedings for breach of an ASBO will be criminal proceedings.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>In relation to possible imprisonment in Northern Ireland, if a child breaches an ASBO and goes to court, he or she will be offered a youth conference. Youth conferencing was introduced as part of the Criminal Justice Review and involves the child and its family and the victim, if the victim wishes it. The aim is that a plan will be drawn up and taken through, which can involve reparation and restitution.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>On the issue of the naming and shaming, about which the noble Baroness is clearly very concerned, the order gives the court discretion to impose reporting restrictions when making an ASBO against a child, as I have already mentioned. The wording of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC107"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC107</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation is clear that the whole of the proceedings is covered. The restrictions cover television and radio broadcasts as well as newspaper reports, which goes beyond the position in England and Wales. Courts will not act carelessly and will be in a position to make a decision on a case-by-case basis. The Government are providing a statutory measure with all of the safeguards in law so that people do not turn to those who would mete out paramilitary-style justice.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>On the provision of public housing and the sectarian split, an ASBO can be used to stop someone being in an area where he has been acting in an anti-social way and the court decides that an order is necessary for the protection of persons from further anti-social behaviour. However, the sanctions must be reasonable and proportionate, and the court, as a public body, must interpret the order in a way that is human rights compliant.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>On the issue of whether an ASBO might result in homelessness, it is not inconceivable but highly unlikely that a court applying the proportionality test would conclude that a person should be excluded from their home, though if alternative accommodation was available that might be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I believe that I have dealt with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, in relation to the Police Service of Northern Ireland being stretched. But I underline the fact that the approach is multi-agency and that the applying partner will have the power to enforce an ASBO.

</p>

<a name="40720-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised the issue of interim ASBOs, which will enable a court to order an immediate stop to anti-social behaviour. That protects the public more quickly and reduces the scope for witness intimidation, sending a clear message to the community that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated. It removes the opportunity for the behaviour to continue while the application is being processed.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>On the issue of the order being tailor-made, I made it clear that this was a matter of learning from what has happened in England and Wales. The measures have been consulted on, and they do not set aside restorative justice orders. I repeat&#151;measures must be reasonable and proportionate.

</p>

<a name="40720-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I have answered the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Laird, on lesson learning. As for the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about whether we shall have more young people going to prison, I hope that that will not be the case. It is important to emphasise that in Northern Ireland, if a child breaches an ASBO and goes to court, he or she will be given the option of a youth conference&#151;as I said, in relation to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady   Blood. If it becomes a matter of custody, the place of custody would be a juvenile centre for 10 to 17 year-olds. But I should like Members of the Committee to remember the availability of the youth conference, which was one of the recommendations of the criminal justice review.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40720-45_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The draft order makes proposals for new legislation in two areas of concern&#151;&quot;hate crime&quot; and &quot;car crime&quot;. Hate crime deals with crimes motivated or aggravated by hatred of race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Car crime deals with the specific and often misnamed area of &quot;joyriding&quot;. Hate crime has seen worrying increases in Northern Ireland in recent times&#151;a quadrupling of numbers in the last five years&#151;and joyriding has frequently been a plague on the lives of some communities.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Racist attacks have increased from 93 in 1998&#150;99 to 453 in 2003&#150;04. Alongside what has become regular reportage of racist incidents in Northern Ireland is the fact that the rate of racial incidents per head of the minority ethnic population is estimated as being almost double that in England and Wales. There have also been worrying increases in attacks against the gay community. A recent attack in Northern Ireland ended in the horrific murder of a completely innocent man, Mr Ian Flanagan, for which the perpetrators quite rightly received life sentences. The disabled have also been increasingly victimised. Attacks based on religion will also be covered by our proposals.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>On car crime, the offence of taking a motor vehicle without the owner&#039;s consent, the nearest current approximation to the offence we are now targeting, has been between 2,000 and 3,000 over the past two years. Dangerous driving offences have increased by 44 per cent in the past year.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Hate crime and car crime are areas of pressing concern for Northern Ireland. Incidents have been seen across Northern Ireland. They are issues which cross boundaries and are faced by all communities. The time is right to legislate.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>On &quot;hate crime&quot;, the draft order will provide courts with powers to impose heavier sentences when an offence is aggravated by hostility based on the victim&#039;s actual or presumed religion, race, disability or sexual orientation. When there has been such aggravation, the proposals will require sentencers to state that in court and to treat this as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The maximum penalties which can be imposed in what are, by and large, crimes of violence are being increased across the board. For example, sentences for grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and putting someone in fear of violence will increase from five to seven years, common assault from one year to two years&#039; imprisonment, harassment from six months to two years&#039; imprisonment, and criminal damage from 10 to l4 years&#039; imprisonment. The draft order also adds sexual orientation and disability to the list of groups currently protected under public order legislation. In <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC109"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

many respects, the &quot;hate crime&quot; provisions are bringing Northern Ireland&#039;s laws up to the same level as is already the case in England and Wales.

</p>

<a name="40720-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The draft order creates an offence of aggravated vehicle taking based on the taking of a vehicle without consent, and it then being driven dangerously, or causing an accident which results in injury, damage to property, or damage to the vehicle. The maximum penalty will be up to five years&#039; imprisonment. The draft order also creates an offence of causing death or grievous bodily injury when committed as part of the new offence of aggravated vehicle taking. The maximum penalty will be up to 14 years&#039; imprisonment. The draft order also increases the maximum penalty for dangerous driving from two to five years&#039; imprisonment. Again, the creation of these offences brings Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The form in which the draft proposals are presented to the Grand Committee today have been influenced by public consultation. The Government undertook three consultation exercises in developing this legislation. Two separate policy consultations were held on race and sectarian crime legislation in Northern Ireland, and one on road traffic offences and penalties. These were then brought together into a single piece of draft legislation, which was consulted upon between February and April of this year.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>As part of the consultations, the proposals were extended to include protections based on sexual orientation and disability. As part of its inquiry into hate crime in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee was particularly influential in the decision to include disability. In relation to our initial road traffic proposals, we listened to some of the representations made and increased our proposed penalties for dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking. These have been increased from two to five years.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The police and the justice system as a whole must be able to respond to criminal behaviour firmly and appropriately. It is essential that the police, the prosecutors and courts have the tools available to them to deal with such behaviour. Our aim is to continue to build a safe and tolerant society for all in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-45_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I commend the order to the Committee.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40720-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the Minister for presenting the order so clearly. Really, I can only support it. I believe that I am right in saying that the Attorney-General has already in recent times appealed a sentence relating to joyriding given by a judge in Northern Ireland as being too light, and won the appeal, some time in the past 12 months.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>My concern about the order derives from the prison population in Northern Ireland and the effect that it might have on it. I do not suppose that we know any <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

specific numbers, and I am not up to date with the present situation, but prisons are fairly crowded in Northern Ireland. I am concerned that the two separate offences in the order, if they do not act as a deterrent, could lead to severe pressure on the Northern Ireland prison system. However, in principle we support the order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40720-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   My contribution will be a little more lengthy than that of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. However, I want to say at the outset how much we welcome the order. We are very pleased to see that the Government have included crimes against disabled people in particular. The Minister will recall that we called for that a long time ago. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 asking the Government to do what they are proposing in this order. So we are pleased to see it included on this occasion, even though the Government objected to the amendment at the time. I am tempted to complain at length about the time taken to accept what we proposed, but I shall resist the urge to do so. This is too important and serious a measure on which to score trivial political points.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Since 1996 the police have been keeping statistics on racially motivated crimes. It was seen as enough of a problem at the time for the police to act to tackle hate crimes, and I shall leave it at that. The legislation is welcome, but I believe it is essential that the police are given proper resources to implement their powers. A few weeks ago I visited the Police Service of Northern Ireland. At this point I should like to record my congratulations to the Chief Constable and his staff, and in particular the DCUs, on their strenuous efforts to engage with members of the ethnic minority communities.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>An example of that is in Dungannon, where an interpreter facilitates communication between the police and Portuguese residents. Another example is in Foyle, where crime prevention leaflets are now being printed in Chinese. I am sure that there are many other excellent examples of good practice. I am also sure that the police could make even deeper inroads into combating these pernicious crimes if they had the resources to do so.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I was delighted to see the Opportunity India campaign recently launched in Belfast, to which senior executives from around 60 companies contributed. The campaign was held to promote trade and investment links between India and Northern Ireland. It was organised by Invest Northern Ireland and facilitated by the noble Lord, Lord Rana. It was indicated that,

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>This legislation will encourage and enable the people of Northern Ireland to welcome the trade and investment coming their way as the economy continues to thrive.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The Royal National Institute for the Blind has asked me to raise some particular issues with the Minister, which I shall do with pleasure. I ask her to consider a number of other measures, including the collection of statistics on disability hate crimes and voice identity parades, in order to maximise the benefit of this order.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The introduction of a requirement for the courts to treat disability hatred as an aggravating factor when sentencing is welcome. While statistics are not collected on disability hate crimes, a number of cases have been reported, of which I shall give one example. One guide dog owner was consistently taunted for being blind and then had firecrackers thrown over the garden wall at her guard dog. In a survey carried out by the Northern Ireland Deaf Youth Association, 36   per cent of young deaf people reported that personal safety was an issue. The same proportion of respondents identified bullying as a concern.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>A survey produced by Dr Sean Kelly from the University of Ulster School of Nursing on the abuse of people with long-term mental illness in Northern Ireland found that 60 per cent of those surveyed had been subject to serious victimisation or harassment. Mencap&#039;s research has found that almost nine in 10   people with learning difficulties have experienced bullying or harassment.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>It would help if the fact that people were disabled, together with their access needs, was included in the data when a person&#039;s details are entered on to the police computer as a victim or perpetrator. I wonder whether the Minister would look at that issue.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>On voice identity parades, we need to see a strong focus on crimes based on prejudice since these types of hate crime are particularly pernicious and damaging to society. The requirement to demonstrate hostility during the committing of a crime or immediately before or after in Section 146 of the Criminal Justice Act, which is being carried over into the draft order, makes a clear distinction. Other tactics such as the use of voice identity parades can and should be employed to deal with crimes based on perceived vulnerability.

</p>

<a name="40720-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The evidence suggests that this is possible. The first ever conviction for murder based on a voice identity parade was secured at the Old Bailey in December 2002. A linguistics expert from Cambridge university was used to make sure that the process was sound, and the detective in the case was commended by the judge for his work. Indeed, the Home Secretary said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;I am firmly of the view that voice recognition is feasible and I have asked my officials and scientific advisers to reconsider this area urgently to see what steps we can take to further encourage the use of voice recognition by police and criminal justice agencies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The Home Secretary has gone on to issue Home Office Circular 57/2003 to police forces on the use of voice identity parades. Will a similar circular be issued by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC112</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Northern Ireland Office adopting the results of the Home Office research? If so, that would be extremely helpful.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I want to quote from a BBC news bulletin issued today which discussed homophobic attacks, in particular those in Derry, which are becoming increasingly vicious. Sean Morrin from the Rainbow Project was speaking after a gay man was attacked and bitten in the face outside a chip shop in the Waterside area on Sunday evening. He was taken to hospital where he received five stitches to his face. Over a period of seven weeks during April and May there were eight homophobic attacks in the Foyle area, while there have been 17 homophobic incidents this year. A police spokesman said that the latter figure equalled the total number of attacks for the previous year. Clearly this is something that needs to be taken seriously.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>All members of society have a duty to tackle bigotry in whatever form it raises its head. The integrated education movement in Northern Ireland has led the way in this respect. Its ethos is to bring all members of society together and the schools to teach their pupils the value of everyone as an individual and not as a member of any particular group. That, too, is our responsibility. By passing this order we shall go some way towards realising our goal of stamping out the evil of racially motivated crime.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40720-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rogan: </b>   Noble Lords know only too well, over many years, the tensions between our two communities in Northern Ireland that unfortunately arise under the name of religion. Perhaps this has disguised a latent or hidden hostility towards our ethnic minority groups in Northern Ireland, groups that I warmly welcome to our Province. Hostility towards ethnic minority groups has become more evident over the past two to three years. Only recently I mentioned in particular the attacks on Filipino nurses in Craigavon.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Equally, several parts of Northern Ireland, in particular certain areas of West Belfast, have for years been plagued by so-called &quot;joyriding&quot;. As the Minister pointed out, that crime is wrongly named. Perhaps it should be called &quot;car crime&quot; or &quot;car hijacking&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I broadly welcome the order because it contains many of the recommendations that my party has put to Her Majesty&#039;s Government over the years. Hate crime, crimes based on hostility towards race, sectarianism and sexual orientation and directed towards any group is totally abhorrent in a civilised society.

</p>

<a name="40720-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>As I have mentioned, crime motivated by race is a growing problem in Northern Ireland. The Government&#039;s own figures show that the rate of racial incidents in Northern Ireland in 2001&#150;02 was 12.9 per 1,000 of the minority ethnic population compared with 6.7 per 1,000 in England and Wales. The PSNI statistics show that the number of racist and homophobic incidents recorded has more than doubled from 226 and 35   respectively in 2002&#150;03 to 453 and 71 in 2003&#150;04. Those figures, shocking enough in themselves, are undoubtedly modest. They do not reflect the high <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC113"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC113</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

number of these crimes that go unreported every day. Even more worrying is the low prosecution rate. In 2002&#150;03 there were only seven prosecutions arising from the 226 racial incidents recorded by the PSNI.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I also welcome the introduction of the new offence of aggravated vehicle taking. Joyriding, or car hijacking as I prefer to call it, is a major problem in Northern Ireland. During the Report stage of the Criminal Justice Bill in another place, my right honourable friend and colleague David Trimble asked the Home Secretary to extend that part of the legislation which dealt with car crime/joyriding to Northern Ireland. It has taken over a year to impress the importance of such a move upon the Northern Ireland Office. For over a year now we have been sending out the wrong message to our young people who are tempted to take cars in this manner.
</p>

<a name="40720-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Car hijacking is simply not tolerated in England and Wales, but apparently it is in Northern Ireland. I therefore welcome this provision, which will bring us into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.

<a name="40720-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I thank all noble Lords for welcoming the order and for the recognition that we all want to see hate crime stamped out.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked specifically about the impact on the prison population. We think that we will see some increase in the length of sentences since we are giving the courts extra powers, but we do not envisage the prison population soaring. However, sentencing is a matter for the courts.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>On the issue of police resourcing, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris&#151;I should say first that I thank her for her positive comments about the Police Service of Northern Ireland following her visit, and in the spirit of Northern Ireland business debated in Grand Committee I thank her for not scoring political points today&#151;we are fully committed to ensuring that the Chief Constable is sufficiently resourced to deliver an efficient and effective policing service. As the noble Baroness is aware, in the current financial year some &#163;726.3 million has been made available to maintain the day-to-day policing service in Northern Ireland. While the level of resources available is crucial to effective policing, so too is ensuring that the best use is made of those resources.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The Police Service of Northern Ireland workforce plan, launched in 2002, is currently under review. It addresses a number of key issues where changes and improvements are making a significant contribution to better policing. The police were involved in the consultation on this and did not indicate that they thought that additional resources would be required.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I turn to the issues raised by the noble Baroness in respect of disability. As the noble Baroness is aware, racial and homophobic incidents are already being monitored. Attacks on the disabled and those motivated by religious hatred will be recorded in line with the commencement of the legislation in September.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The recording of hate crime involving hostility towards victims because of their disability will follow the guidelines that came out of the review as a result of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, so crimes will be recorded as disability hate crimes if they are perceived as such by victims or by any other person. The victim&#039;s disability will also be recorded.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Voice recognition can already form part of evidence which can be used to secure convictions. The Police Service of Northern Ireland will consider a range of measures when implementing hate crime legislation. The police are supportive of practices and initiatives that help and protect vulnerable people.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, questioned the number of prosecutions. The Chief Constable has increased patrols in relevant areas and has taken steps to ensure that victims are more ready and able to come forward. That high visibility patrolling is aimed at both reducing incidents and improving contact with local communities. That is because the police need community support if they are to be able to address crime in all its forms. The Government have already introduced special direction measures, including live video links, by way of the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 to protect vulnerable or intimidated witnesses.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>On the timing of the introduction of these provisions, this is our first appropriate legislative opportunity after the consultation. We are going further than in England and Wales by proposing penalties of five years&#039; imprisonment for aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving, which is in direct response to our public consultation. I hope that I have addressed all the points that have been raised.

<a name="40720-47_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40720-47_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Dangerous Wild Animals (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>This order would introduce provisions broadly in line with those already in force in Great Britain by the enactment of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, as modified by the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 (Modification) Order 1984. The main purpose of the order is to address public safety and animal welfare concerns through the introduction of a licensing, inspection and enforcement scheme to regulate the keeping of dangerous wild animals by private individuals. The scheme will be centrally administered by the Department of the Environment.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The main provisions of the order will require any person wishing to keep a dangerous wild animal as defined in the schedule to the order to obtain a licence from the department prior to taking ownership of the animal. A licence will be valid for a period of 12 months or such longer period as the department <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC115"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shall determine. The keeping of a dangerous wild animal without a licence will be an offence and persons under 18 years of age will not be able to apply for a licence.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>It will require the department to perform a range of checks on all applications. These checks will relate to the applicant, the accommodation and the conditions in which the animal will be kept. In addition, the department will also be required to receive a report from a veterinary surgeon or other person deemed suitably competent by it.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>It will require the department to set a number of mandatory conditions for any licence it may grant. These will relate to matters such as the welfare of the animal, the person or persons entitled to keep the animal, the number or type of animal that can be kept and the place where the animal is to be kept. The department will also be free to apply other conditions as it sees fit.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The order provides applicants with a right of appeal to a magistrates&#039; court against any decision by the department to refuse a licence or against any conditions imposed on the grant of a licence. It will create an offence where the requirements of a licence are not complied with. It will also give the department powers of entry and inspection for the purposes of assessing an application or determining if the requirements of the legislation or of an existing licence are being complied with.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The order will give the department powers to seize any animal where the requirements of the legislation or of a licence are not being complied with. The department will also be given powers to destroy a seized animal, under veterinary supervision, or otherwise dispose of it. It will give owners the right of appeal within 21 days to a magistrates&#039; court against seizure and prohibit the department destroying or otherwise disposing of a seized animal before the appeal has been determined. It establishes penalties for any person found guilty of not complying with the requirements of the legislation. Courts will be given power to cancel existing licences or disqualify any such person from keeping dangerous wild animals.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>It will provide transitional arrangements for existing owners to make arrangements to apply for a licence. It will also provide for the legislation to come into operation by way of a commencement order so that all supporting administrative arrangements are in place to ensure public safety. It will give the department the power to modify the schedule that defines dangerous wild animals.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>Following strong representations from key respondents during the consultation process, two provisions not included in the original draft order have now been added. These additional provisions are set out in Article 8, which makes it an offence to give or sell a dangerous wild animal to any person who has not produced a valid licence to keep the animal in question, and paragraphs (4) to (15) of Article 9, which provide for a transitional voluntary surrender scheme for existing animals for a period of three months after the coming into operation of the main provisions of the order.

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>This draft order fills an important gap in the Northern Ireland statute book in relation to both public safety and the welfare of dangerous wild animals in private collections. It will provide a robust licensing and enforcement regime to control the keeping of these animals. It will also bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom while including other provisions which reflect the particular needs and circumstances of Northern Ireland.

</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40720-47_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, we have nothing inherently against this order. However, it is a detailed and heavy-duty order that encompasses a lot of restrictions and rules. I wonder, therefore, and challenge gently the proof of the need for this legislation&#151;other than in zoos and so forth, which I think I am right in saying already have their own licensing and regulatory regimes. I am concerned that we are perhaps legislating for the sake of legislating. I accept the need to protect the public and the necessity to protect animals of any type, let alone wild and dangerous ones, so I find it strange that at this particular juncture in time someone has thought that we need this legislation.
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I have only two questions. I imagine that if someone wants a licence to look after a dangerous wild animal, they will have to pay something for it. Has that been considered and what might be the cost of such a licence? Do the Government anticipate making a profit? Against that, I wonder what will be the cost of administering the order. Is it possible that the Government will find themselves landed with considerable extra costs?
</p>

<a name="40720-47_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Aside from those queries, I have no particular feelings about this order.
</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   As we have heard, there have been controls on the keeping of wild animals in all parts of the UK except Northern Ireland since 1976. I understand that at the time it was felt that such legislation was not needed in Northern Ireland. But, with the passage of time, it appears that it might now be necessary. I understand that large cats have been sighted and that they have affected livestock, so perhaps it is now necessary to introduce legislation for Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I too have only a few brief questions. The order will require the department to perform a range of checks on all those who apply for a licence. Will a vet undertake those checks? What is meant in Article 3(5)(a) by &quot;other person authorised&quot;? Also, are the Government satisfied that the age of 18 is appropriate, given that we are considering reducing the age of consent in many areas? The age of 16 would appear to be more appropriate. I wonder why the age of 18 was chosen. Finally, can the Government be more specific about the cost of the licence?
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Other than those queries, we think that the order is acceptable and we are happy to support it.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   I welcome the order. When I was a Member in the other place, in my constituency of Strangford we had a gentleman who took a lion out for a walk every evening at five o&#039;clock. It certainly was not the appropriate time to go canvassing because everyone cleared off the streets. I had many complaints from constituents that on this matter Northern Ireland was out of line with the rest of the UK. It is ridiculous that you can keep a pet corgi and must have a &#163;5 licence, but you can have a lion and need not pay a licence fee whatever.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I have one question. What happens to these wild animals when they are seized? Are they put down? Does the USPCA keep them until they die naturally? Are they handed over to the zoos for proper care and attention?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rogan: </b>   I, too, welcome the order. It has been a long time coming. Criminal legislation for Great Britain has been in place since 1976. The Northern Ireland Assembly was consulting on the matter when it was suspended in the autumn of 2002.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I have one question. The schedule names pure breeds, but what about cross breeding? I am reminded that a few years ago someone bred a wolf and an Alsatian. One of them killed many sheep in County Fermanagh, including some on the estate of my noble friend Lord Brookeborough. There was also great fear for humans in the county.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>People who mistreat animals or release exotic pets into the wild need to be made culpable under the law and the order is therefore greatly welcomed by us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   I am grateful that the Minister has found time to allow us to debate this matter. I did not think that I would get back from a visit to the Farnborough air show in time. I was invited to examine this and another order. When I looked at the explanatory memorandum to this order I was startled to find on page 1, paragraph 5, the statement,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;a continuing trend for keeping DWAs as pets&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>That may be.

</p>

<a name="40720-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I then looked in the schedule. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, will be equally sad to discover that under Article 2 the Department of the Environment is responsible. I am sure that the Minister will know that during my time and that of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, animal health was one of the prime concerns of the so-called Department of Agriculture.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I looked at the animals listed in the schedule. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, mentioned a lion and I thought of cats and other domestic creatures. The Minister will not necessarily have scanned pages 12 to 15, but when reading them one or two things came to my mind.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Pages 14 and 15 list reptiles. Mole vipers and certain venomous snakes are mentioned. We then see listed Elapidae and Viperidae, including certain front-fanged venomous snakes, including cobras, adders, fer-de-lance, rattlesnakes and vipers. I suppose that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one has to be comprehensive with such legislation, but I was astounded that such a list appears in the schedule.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>One thing concerns me; that although such animals might be kept in a pet shop under adequate conditions, suppose that they get out. If there is a problem, what will be the result? Suppose that someone is bitten?
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I was glancing at the exemptions and see that Article 7(3)(b) states that Article 3(1) shall not apply to a dangerous wild animal,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;which is kept for the production of food, wool, skin, hair or feathers or for such other purpose as the Department may by order prescribe&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40720-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>I also saw in Article 5(12) various measures which might relate to one of the lovely creatures listed on page 15. If one of them escaped, would someone be able to retain it and extract serum&#151;anti-snake-bite serum? I hope that the order will allow whichever department is responsible to get hold of these lovely creatures and extract the serum so that treatment can be available in a hospital. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, wondered what happened to these happy creatures if the department finds them&#151;including some of the Sydney funnel-web spiders or their close relatives? Are they destroyed or what?
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I commend the noble Baroness on the thoroughness of the order, but I am astounded by the vast array of creatures. I hope that it is replicated in Great Britain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, that I have read all the pages in the schedule, which make very interesting reading. When I read them, I was glad that I did not recognise most of the species listed.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I also say to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, with respect to his getting here on time, he is obviously not a regular in the consideration of Northern Ireland business. We are extremely thorough in our consideration of Northern Ireland business, which is why we are still here.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked why the legislation is required. In the absence of regulation, the department cannot be certain about the number and species of animals presently being kept by private individuals. The absence of this baseline information makes it difficult to respond to reports of sightings; for example, by checking for escapees.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Reports of incidents or nuisance caused by dangerous wild animals continues to be rare, although there have been a number of recent reported sightings, plus reports of injuries to livestock. However, each reported incident, no matter how minor, tends to attract significant public concern about the potential risk to public safety and the draft order addresses this concern by introducing a suitable regulatory regime.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>On the cost, the draft order provides for the department to recoup the full costs of administering the scheme by charging licence fees. Fees will be set to recover all direct and indirect costs incurred as a result of a licence application and not with the intention of deterring ownership of dangerous wild animals or as a means of raising revenue. So at this point in time it is <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40720-48_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. We need an undertaking that the cost of the licence is highly unlikely to become a deterrent to those wishing to keep certain species. They may be unable to afford the licence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40720-48_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I repeat that we will be setting fees to recover all direct and indirect costs, but not with the intention of deterring ownership of dangerous wild animals and certainly not as a means of raising revenue. I can assure the Committee on that.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The department may also incur costs in accommodating and caring for animals voluntarily surrendered. The extent of these costs will depend on the number of animals involved and rare species.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The cost of a licence will be broken down in four elements: the department&#039;s administrative costs in processing applications; the costs for inspection by a suitably competent person; the costs of obtaining suitable insurance against liability for any damage which may be caused by an animal; and any costs associated with upgrading accommodation to comply with all the licence requirements.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>On the specific point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, on the departmental discretion to appoint a suitably qualified person, we are thinking of those with experience of zoos. It may not be a vet, but a person who has extensive experience having worked in a zoo.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked specifically about hybrids, in particular wolf hybrids. They are an increasing source of concern to the public and some respondents to consultation in the draft order have recommended that wolf hybrids should be included in the schedule of animals which will come within the remit of the legislation. However, the definition is complex both from a scientific and administrative viewpoint. It is generally recognised that there are no scientifically proven methods which will withstand legal challenge to differentiate wolf hybrids from other canines. This inability scientifically to isolate wolf hybrids makes breed specification difficult, if not impossible, to administer effectively and equitably. It is an issue that many other countries also face.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The Defra consultation paper on changes to the 1976 Act proposes to define hybrids in the schedule as animals which have 8 per cent or more of the pure listed animal DNA. Should this definition be adopted in Great Britain, we intend to amend the schedules to the draft order accordingly. This can be done by subordinate legislation.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked what happens to seized animals. The animal will be passed to a designated person or body to keep on behalf of the department. The department has the power to dispose of or destroy the animals 21 days after the seizure date or until the outcome of an appeal.

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked which department would be responsible. I note his views about it being environment or agriculture, but the most important point is that the regulatory regime should be effective.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>As regards serum and snake bites, even with regulation, venomous snakes can still pose a risk, not least to their owners. There has been at least one such incident in Northern Ireland. The Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast has procedures in place for dealing with snake bites, including measures to minimise venom absorption, and the availability of expert advice on the need for anti-venom administration and access to anti-venom stocks which are held in Liverpool and in London.
</p>

<a name="40720-48_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I recognise that the recent review in Great Britain raised concerns about the effective control over venomous snakes and I also recognise the dangers posed by these animals which, by their very nature, are easily transported and concealed. But I believe that the proposals in the draft order will provide an effective regulatory regime for venomous snakes, as for other dangerous wild animals. I hope I have addressed the points.

<a name="40720-49_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40720-49_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Vehicle Testing (Temporary Exemptions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The order would enable the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to make regulations to provide for the issue of certificates for temporary exemption, exempting private cars and motor cycles from the requirements of normal testing for a specified temporary period and to permit such certificates to be acceptable documentary evidence for the purpose of obtaining vehicle excise licences.

</p>

<a name="40720-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Certificates of temporary exemption will be issued as an alternative to vehicle test certificates in exceptional circumstances. &quot;Exceptional circumstances&quot; means a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

failure in the supply of essential services or other unexpected happenings such as a fire, accident or industrial action.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The power to issue certificates already exists for goods vehicles, but no such contingency arrangements are available for private cars and motorcycles. The order will regularise that position. The order will alleviate some of the pressures created as a result of the industrial action which is currently having an impact on the capacity of the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency in Northern Ireland to deliver normal vehicle testing services. This has resulted in many drivers being unable to use their vehicles legally on the roads or to get vehicle excise licences. It is also impacting adversely on the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The issue of certificates of temporary exemption would temporarily remove some vehicles from the testing cycle. This would free up capacity to allow the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency to focus on other vehicles such as buses, taxis and goods vehicles used on international journeys. It would also enable the agency to manage the backlog of work that will still remain when the industrial action ends. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Vehicle Testing (Temporary Exemptions) (Northern Ireland) Order   2004.&#151;(<i>Baroness Amos</i>.)
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40720-49_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for bringing this order before us at the end of a long series. It is good for us to spend a whole day on Northern Ireland matters, particularly in such detail, because we are refreshed on what is happening on the ground.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>We talked earlier today about the problems of the strike, so I will not mention it again. Obviously, I support the order, understanding the reason for its being brought to your Lordships&#039; House. I am concerned about the adequacy of the length of time the order will be in place. One does not want to be too pessimistic, but as we have had a lengthy stoppage and the strike continues, there will be a serious backlog. That will affect our hauliers in Europe, and some European countries will not necessarily at first accept the fact that some of the vehicles were not tested on time.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>However, I am more concerned that the hauliers will be expected to maintain the level of inspection of their vehicles were the MoT system in place. I do not know, but I suspect that the hauliers&#039; depots are not equipped to the same extent for vehicle inspection as are the MoT centres. Funnily enough, I have never had an MoT test in Northern Ireland or in England, I only had them in Spain. However, the set-up in an MoT centre for heavy goods vehicles and for motor cars requires a certain amount of specialist equipment to ensure that all the settings comply with EU rules and regulations.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>I am concerned that Northern Ireland hauliers will not be equipped to carry out the necessary checks on their vehicles, which by now might be a month or so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

overdue, and that they will let them run on for a while. I suppose that we could be talking of checks on heavy goods vehicles being delayed for up to six months.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I am also concerned about the effect on the insurance policies of hauliers and private vehicle owners. While I was doing some homework on this subject, I read that many insurance policies depend on MoTs being up to date. I wonder what Her Majesty&#039;s Government have done in talking to the insurance industry. The longer it lasts the bigger the problem will become.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>It is all very well to say that there will be an extension in time, but an insurance company may say that its policy states that the MoT has to be done on a given date and that if it is not done and a driver has an accident or something goes wrong the driver is not insured. That is an area on which I should like some encouragement.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>Lastly, as regards hauliers, it seems that if there is a significant backlog&#151;such as six months&#151;and the haulage industry has to incur increased costs, we should look to the Government and the department to cover at least a part of those costs. With those riders, I support the order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="40720-49_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I, too, thank the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council for the very full, clear and gracious responses that she has made today to the points raised on the orders. As we have heard, this order is the result of industrial action by civil servants in Northern Ireland, which is impacting on the ability of the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency to grant vehicle excise licences or MoTs.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The Government have known about this difficulty for a long time. Why have they taken so long to do anything about it? I understand that the exemption applies only within the UK. What happens if someone wants to take a car abroad from Northern Ireland? How can we be assured that cars coming over from Northern Ireland are safe on the roads of the rest of the UK? What happens if a car is involved in a road accident? That is a real concern, particularly for people who are going abroad.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>It is difficult for us to oppose this order because law-abiding citizens will do their best to get their vehicles covered and in good order. But I have considerable concern supporting something that appears to condone the driving of unroadworthy vehicles. I am sure that most of the people of Northern Ireland are sensible enough not to want to drive cars that are in bad condition, but it is a dilemma. We can only hope that it will be resolved quickly for the safety of all the road users in Northern Ireland. We support the order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40720-49_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   I suppose that it would be unwise of me to be controversial at this hour of the evening. Hence, I shall content myself by saying that of all the Orders in Council that I have seen brought before Parliament, this surely must be one of the most irresponsible that I have seen for a long time. In bringing forward this order, the Government have abdicated their responsibility.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40720-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>My figures may be wrong, but can the Minister tell me whether at present there is somewhere in the region of 87,000 vehicles overdue for MoT testing? Is it the case that normally at the stage when vehicles go for an MoT test&#151;after the owners have taken the trouble to try to get them up to standard&#151;on average 22 per cent are turned down at the first time of testing? If that is so and my mathematics are right, there are something like 19,140 vehicles currently on the road that are unroadworthy, plus those vehicles that are currently unroadworthy but which, if they were tested, would be brought up to standard. Surely, that is a huge problem for people in Northern Ireland. We must find out the truth behind what is happening in this sector. I notice that in another place the Minister, Angela Smith, said that she would like to dispel the myth that the order was just a response to industrial action. But if it is not just, or not mainly, a response to industrial action, why is there such a backlog?
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Is it not the fact that something like &#163;17 million has been spent in updating the testing centres in Northern Ireland? It would be interesting to see a breakdown of that figure and to know how much of that figure involved the updating of equipment and how much was involved in provision of software. Is it because of the arrangement, whereby that &#163;17 million was spent and the Government have a contract with the people who provided the equipment and software, that they cannot do what should be done in any sensible situation&#151;to contract out to our main agents, the garages in Northern Ireland, the responsibility for doing MoTs.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I know that at the moment, as Minister Smith indicated, the MoT fee in Northern Ireland is &#163;28, whereas in GB it is &#163;40.75. However, I and most of us know that major garages in Northern Ireland actually buy a package to send vehicles over to Scotland&#151;a package that costs &#163;90 for transport and testing in Scotland&#151;after which they bring them back again to turn them over as second-hand vehicles. Why, then, are ordinary car drivers not allowed to avail themselves of the equipment that most major garages have, which they could use very quickly and efficiently to bring vehicles up to the standard?
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>We are creating this permission to drive unfit vehicles on the road, while the Government cannot afford to privatise the system. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether the efficiency of those involved in MoT testing up until recently has been as efficient as it should be, given the new equipment that is available. I am told that the testing of vehicles is taking around three times as long as it should. But if, for whatever financial reason, we are unable to privatise the system, surely there should be an interim measure to secure roadworthy vehicles in Northern Ireland. We might even have had pilot programmes to see whether such a move would work; here was an opportunity to see whether private garages could provide the service more efficiently than is being done presently. But no&#151;that opportunity has been lost.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Minister Smith said that car drivers will still be required to keep the car in a roadworthy condition at all times. What an opportunity that is for them! Do <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we really believe that all people will keep their cars in good condition, unless there is legislation being enforced? If that is the case, we do not need MoT testing in the first place.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The point raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Glentoran, on insurance certificates was even more important. The Minister in another place said that most insurance certificates do not say that the driver must have an MoT certificate. Of course they do not, but they insist that drivers keep their car in a roadworthy condition. In other words, they must ensure that the tyres, brakes and steering are in good order. With this exemption we can be sure that there will be vehicles on the road that are not in good order in those respects.
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>If that is the case, what happens not when someone has a bang resulting in a &#163;500 or even &#163;5,000 claim, but when someone is seriously disabled for life and there is a claim for tens of thousands of pounds? Will the insurance companies say, &quot;We have an arrangement with government; they will make up the deficit?&quot;. I am certain that the insurance companies will not pay. Have government an arrangement with the insurance companies to fulfil any shortfall for which the companies would under other circumstances be liable?
</p>

<a name="40720-49_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>This Order in Council is a death sentence on people in Northern Ireland. I hope that I am not given to exaggeration, but currently there are 19,000 vehicles on the road that should be MoT tested but are not. In addition, there will be all the other vehicles coming on stream plus those that would have been brought up to standard. It strikes me that there is a carelessness regarding the welfare of car drivers and other road users in Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney: </b>   MoT testing in Northern Ireland is now in disarray; that is why this order has been brought before the Committee. We all recognise that it is in disarray mainly because of the strike; therefore the Government are right to bring forward the order. I am only sorry that it was not brought forward earlier.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>My one question relates to the term &quot;temporary exemptions&quot;. How long does a temporary exemption last&#151;one month, one year? That has not been spelt out.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>I can never understand why Northern Ireland has a different MoT testing system from the one in the rest of the United Kingdom. Obviously, it should be in private hands. The Government should consider giving those currently employed in MoT centres the opportunity to buy out the system so that it is privatised from here on, leaving us in the same position as England, Scotland and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Since there is disarray in MoT testing with the result that we need temporary exemptions, now that there is to be a planning services strike, can we get temporary exemptions from obtaining planning permission?
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   The Minister in another place mentioned that 90,000&#151;the noble Lord, Lord   Maginnis, referred to 87,000&#151;cases were waiting, as reported at column 12 of <i>Hansard</i>. Can the noble Baroness indicate what proportion it is of all <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

annual testing, should it be going on, and how long will it take to clear the backlog? My noble friend Lord Glentoran thought that it would take approximately six months.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Earlier in her speech in another place the Minister said that 5,700 driving tests had been cancelled. I presume that they were cancelled because of this dispute, although it is probably not relevant to the order.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I agree with what many Members of the Committee said concerning drivers being stopped. Whether or not they have had an accident, it could be difficult if they do not have the relevant certificate or piece of paper&#151;even if the insurance and so forth is in order. When drivers come to Great Britain, I suspect that they will generally be all right, but it could be extremely difficult if they go abroad.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>That said, this seems to be the best and quickest way to ensure that Northern Ireland motorists drive safely and are able to keep death off the road. However, it is interesting that on average 22 per cent of vehicles fail the MoT; so there are approximately 20,000 people still on the road who perhaps should not be. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for her patience.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I shall try to address the points raised in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked when we propose to stop issuing certificates of temporary exemption. In the current climate of industrial action, the period of time during which certificates will be issued will depend on how long the dispute continues. They are seen as a tool for enabling the department to manage the workload when the strike comes to an end. We intend to continue using temporary exemptions until the waiting time has returned to an acceptable level. In future, they will be a useful tool for dealing with emergency situations such as fire or a failure in the supply of essential services. A temporary exemption can last for any period up to a maximum of six months.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>As regards hauliers maintaining their vehicles to the same standard, there will be no change to the   arrangements for maintaining vehicles. The exemptions affect only testing. That applies also to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, with whom I do not agree. The majority of us who have a car that requires an MoT do not wait until after the MoT to determine whether our vehicle needs work on it, but will have a regular maintenance regime with a garage to ensure that the vehicle is kept roadworthy. We see that as an individual responsibility.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Of course, there is the annual testing regime for an MoT, but it is important to recognise that roadworthiness is the responsibility of the individual. It is not the responsibility of the state. I accept that having to get an MoT concentrates the mind, but I do not agree with the noble Lord that the majority of people would not keep their cars in good condition. I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column GC126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

think that the opposite is true. A car is an investment. It is in the individual&#039;s interests to keep it in a roadworthy condition.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My experience of going through an MoT test annually in Spain is that there are specific regulations for which specific equipment is needed. For example, a gauge can be obtained that will indicate when a tyre is illegal. As regards the steering wheel an inch&#039;s play or whatever is allowed, but, again, there is a specific piece of measuring equipment that will indicate whether it is legal. It is the same for the light settings, handbrake, and so forth.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The average driver will not be aware of that sort of detail. Although I have spent my life with vehicles and was in charge of a great number at one time, I have still taken a vehicle for an MoT and been told that one of my tyres needs changing. That sort of detail will not be available. People will be driving &quot;illegally&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I take that point, but I also recognise that most individuals have some kind of service regime for their cars. The majority of garages are able to give that kind of information. I am not saying that there is not an issue here that needs to be addressed. All I am saying is that there is a degree of responsibility that rests with individuals with respect to roadworthiness that we need to accept.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   With the greatest respect, the Minister must live in a different world from the one in which I live. The majority of people who service their vehicles regularly are those who have vehicles that are less than three years old&#151;people who have new vehicles and want to keep them in good order. The older the vehicle is, the less it is serviced, for the simple reason that it becomes a very costly operation.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>In Northern Ireland&#151;and I am sure that it is the same in other places&#151;we see vehicles driven until they literally fall apart on the side of the road and are abandoned there. Young people then pick them up and use them as runabouts. It would be interesting for Members of the Committee to know the number of accidents caused by uninsured, unlicensed drivers running about with those broken-down abandoned cars. That is the sequence of my experience of motor cars in Northern Ireland. I hope that the Minister takes my point seriously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40720-50_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   The noble Lord has entirely made my point for me. He referred to uninsured, unlicensed drivers; even with an MoT regime, they do not go and get their cars MoTed, because they are driving without insurance, licences and MoTs. That is a completely different group of people to the one that I hope we are talking about&#151;the majority of individuals, who want to operate within the law. We have a specific problem that we need to address in relation to the strike, so I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, has just made my point for me.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I go back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Glentoran, who was concerned about the possibility of increased costs for hauling. The proposed order would not impose additional costs on the haulage industry. On the issue of insurance, which many Members of the Committee mentioned, we have advised motorists to check with their insurance provider that having a temporary exemption rather than a vehicle test certificate does not invalidate their insurance policy. The practice varies between insurance companies. The insurance policies require vehicles to be roadworthy, and some companies use the test certificate as a guarantee of that. But they do not all do that, so it is important for motorists to check with individual companies&#151;and the Police Service of Northern Ireland has an awareness-raising campaign in that regard.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>I take the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady   Harris, that the temporary exemptions appear to fly in the face of what we are trying to do about road safety. I cannot pretend that temporary exemptions are an adequate replacement for the normal regime of vehicle testing and roadside enforcement. But I remind the noble Baroness and the rest of the Committee that temporary exemptions are meant to be a short-term measure, as the name implies, designed to meet the exigencies of a particularly difficult situation that is adversely affecting businesses and ordinary motorists. In order to maintain the focus on road safety and ensure that motorists are fully aware of their responsibilities, we are stepping up publicity in that regard. In issuing the temporary exemptions, we shall try to ensure that those who must go abroad or have a particular need are given a degree of priority when the tests restart. A temporary exemption order will allow a vehicle to be driven legally on the road and <br>&nbsp;<br>

to be registered and taxed. They do not remove the requirement for motorists to keep their vehicles in a roadworthy condition.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>On the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Maginnis, of whether the process might be contracted out, that has been considered many times. Each time it has been considered, the conclusion has been that the existing system best meets the needs of the people of Northern Ireland. Of course, the approach in Great Britain has much to commend it, but there is an issue of consistency. Many garages in England and Wales do only six MoT tests a week, and concerns have been raised that the way in which the tests are carried out by individual garages means that a degree of inconsistency is creeping into the system. On the other hand, in Northern Ireland, which has been widely regarded as a model of best practice, the fact that the tests are concentrated means that independence, consistency and objectivity are at the heart of the system. The proposals advanced by the noble Lord have been considered on many occasions.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Temporary exemptions represent a helpful contingency for the long term but obviously the strike is creating a particularly difficult situation, which is why the backlog is at such a high level.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, mentioned the efficiency of vehicle testing with the new equipment. I understand that tests now take roughly the same amount of time as they did before, but we hope that, as a result of the introduction of the new equipment and the upgrading, the new system will be more efficient in the longer term. Indeed, as the noble Lord indicated, tests are much cheaper in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales. The department carries out about 500,000 tests a year. The length of time that it will take to clear the backlog will depend on how soon the strike comes to an end.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.
</p>

<a name="40720-50_para16"></a>
<p>The Grand Committee adjourned at thirteen minutes before eight o&#039;clock.

<a name="40720-51_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland Independent Monitoring Commission</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40720-51_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos): </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="40720-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>On 20 April 2004 I formally requested the Independent Monitoring Commission to prepare a security normalisation report under Article 5(2) of the International Agreement between the British and Irish Governments.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>Article 5(2) enables the British Government to commission the IMC to prepare a report on security normalisation activity undertaken over a specified period. I asked the IMC to report on all normalisation activities which have taken place since December 1999 up to the present time. The activities are set out in Article 5(1)(a)(i) to (v) of the International Agreement. The IMC report also takes account of views on the effects of normalisation on the ground and the programme of reform to deliver a community based policing environment in Northern Ireland. It is distinct from the monitoring of the programme of normalisation included in the Joint Declaration which is yet to be commenced.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>I am most grateful to the commission for its thorough report. The report is helpful in identifying the extent of steps that have been taken to reduce the security profile in Northern Ireland. The report also recognises that further steps are being taken, but that these must be measured against the prevailing assessment of the security threat. I have placed copies of the second report of the Independent Monitoring Commission in the Libraries of both Houses.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="40720-51_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses copies of <i>Taking Action: The UK&#039;s Strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, </i>which I published today.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>This paper is being published by the Department for International Development (DfID) but the following government Departments worked with DfID to help to produce it: the Department of Health, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, HM Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Patent Office, the Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>AIDS is one of the greatest threats to eradicating poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. Over the past 25 years the number of people affected by HIV has risen dramatically, from the first AIDS cases identified in the 1980s to the 38 million who are living with HIV and AIDS today. Over 20   million people have died. Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered the severest impact: over 25 million people are currently living with HIV and AIDS and 12 million children have been orphaned by AIDS. By 2010 the number of orphans who will have lost parents to AIDS may rise to 18 million. In Asia and Eastern Europe, there is a serious risk of a generalised epidemic unless action is taken now. In all regions, women and young people are particularly vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The UK Government are committed to fighting AIDS and reversing the spread of HIV. The challenges facing the world were set out in the <i>UK&#039;s Call for Action on HIV/AIDS</i>,<i> </i>published on World AIDS Day last year. <i>Taking Action: The UK&#039;s strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world </i>sets out how the UK will respond to the challenges by: promoting a comprehensive response to tackle prevention, treatment and care as well as addressing the social impact of AIDS; prioritising the needs of women, <br>&nbsp;<br>

young people, including orphans and other children; focusing on human rights, stigma and discrimination; and ensuring that action on AIDS is sustainable in the long term as well as responsive to immediate needs.
</p>

<a name="40720-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>As announced in the spending review, the UK Government will commit at least &#163;1.5 billion over the next three years to tackle AIDS in the developing world. Of this, at least &#163;150 million will be dedicated to helping orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS, especially in Africa. We will also be doubling our contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria with an additional &#163;77   million over the next three years. This is in addition to extra money for UNAIDS and UNFPA announced in my Written Statement of 6 July.

</p>

<a name="40720-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>We are pleased to announce the new chapter to the Strategic Defence Review set out the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to significantly improve operational effectiveness. UAVs will be a key contributor to network enabled capability and their ability to provide persistent surveillance of the battlefield or theatre of operations, without putting lives at risk has been demonstrated recently by US operations in Afghanistan and coalition operations in Iraq.

</p>

<a name="40720-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The central element of the UK&#039;s current plans for acquiring UAVs is the Watchkeeper programme, which will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery. Watchkeeper will be an advanced system integrating air vehicles, sensor payloads and ground control facilities. It will be joined to the wider command and control network through communication systems such as Bowman, allowing information to be passed quickly, providing commanders with an improved understanding of the battle space and shortening sensor to shooter times.

<a name="40720-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The competition for entry into the final stage of the Watchkeeper programme has been run between two industrial teams led by Northrop Grumman and Thales Defence Ltd. Both submitted bids reflecting an understanding of the programme requirements, the technical complexities, the project management requirements and UK industrial participation. Following detailed consideration of the proposals, on the basis of value for money and demonstration of the best potential to deliver the required capability, the selection of the team led by Thales Defence Ltd will be announced as the preferred bidder for the Watchkeeper demonstration and manufacturing phase by the Secretary of State for Defence at the Farnborough International Airshow today. Further negotiations will be required before the project is ready to pass its main investment decision. It is planned to start these negotiations immediately. Depending on the outcome of that work, we aim to make the main gate decision on Watchkeeper later this year. The intention remains to bring Watchkeeper into service as soon as possible with capability beginning around the end of 2006.

<a name="40720-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister will publish for public consultation on 30 July a paper on park home implied terms and written statement.
</p>

<a name="40720-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The Housing Bill includes several clauses that improve the rights of park home owners. These include two powers allowing the appropriate national authority (Secretary of State for England and National Assembly for Wales in relation to Wales) to make secondary legislation relating to the implied terms and the written statement.
</p>

<a name="40720-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>Provision has been made for the first exercise of the power to specify new implied terms, and to amend and delete existing ones, to have retrospective effect. It is therefore vital that we address all the important issues in the first exercise of the power. An affirmative resolution approving the order from both Houses of Parliament will be necessary.

</p>

<a name="40720-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>In the consultation paper we have proposed 22 changes to the implied terms on which we have already consulted informally. We propose, for example, amendments on, among other things, further tightening of the resale process, increased transparency in the payment system and more residents&#039; rights through the quiet enjoyment of the pitch.

<a name="40720-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The Housing Bill contains a re-enactment of the power of the appropriate national authority to prescribe requirements with which written statements must comply.

</p>

<a name="40720-53_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>I have received the annual reports for the year 2003 from the five recognised supervisory bodies for company auditors: a combined report from the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and one each from the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants. Copies of the reports have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>Schedule 11 to the Companies Act 1989 sets out the requirements which a body must meet to be eligible for recognised supervisory body status. These include requirements to have adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with its rules relating to membership and eligibility&#151;for example, holding an appropriate qualification, being a fit and proper person, working to technical and ethical standards, maintaining competence&#151;discipline and investigation of complaints. In these reports, the recognised bodies inform the Government about their activities in relation to these arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>In January 2003 I announced a number of changes to the regulatory regime of the accountancy and audit professions, including the establishment of a new independent inspection unit, located within the Financial Reporting Council, and a professional oversight board for accountancy (POBA), to take over, from this department, my functions under Part II of the Companies Act 1989 in respect of the recognised supervisory bodies. I am pleased to report that these bodies are now established and in operation. The delegation of these powers is dependent on provisions in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill currently before the House and so for the time being my department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the recognised supervisory bodies.

<a name="40720-53_head2"></a><h3 align=center>BBC Charter Review</h3>








<p><a name="wms_st_21"></a>


<a name="wms_st_22"></a>
<a name="40720-53_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:


</p>

<a name="40720-53_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>On 11 December 2003, I announced the first phase of BBC Charter review with the launch of a major public consultation. The consultation was supported by a programme of survey research, visits to different parts of the country to hear the views of people in the media industry and the public first hand, and a series of events for children and young people to hear what they had to say.

</p>

<a name="40720-53_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>By the time the consultation closed on 31 March 2004 we had received over 5,000 written responses and there had been over 25,000 unique visitors to the charter review website. We published the responses on the Internet as the consultation proceeded. The research fieldwork we commissioned was completed in June this year.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>Today, I am publishing the results of this consultation and research. The report we are publishing&#151;<i>What You Said About the BBC</i>&#151;summarises the main points that were put to us. It does not capture every single one of the many hundreds of issues raised, which is why I am also publishing in full the reports of research and consultation on which <i>What You Said . . . </i> is based. These documents, together with the consultation responses I have already published, should be seen as a complementary package and taken together give a comprehensive picture of the views received.
<a name="wms_st_23"></a></p>

<a name="40720-53_para7"></a>
<p><i>What You Said . . .  </i>contains both praise and criticism. Most people indicated that they value the BBC and hold it in high esteem, but a significant minority disagreed. To those who like the BBC it was generally seen as the best broadcaster for news, documentaries and features about personal interests. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS18"></a>

<b>20 Jul 2004 : Column WS18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

But even to many supporters it is seen as being by no means perfect. Although satisfaction levels are high, most people want to see changes. However, there is a clear view that the BBC should continue to remain independent of government, parliamentary and commercial pressures.


</p>

<a name="40720-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>People believe the BBC should keep up with developments in new technology and should be a leading partner in new markets&#151;this will be particularly relevant as we make the journey towards full switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>Contributors clearly felt that there was room for improvement in the way the BBC is governed and regulated, although there is more debate to be had about exactly what changes are needed. And on the question of how we should pay for the BBC, the licence fee was widely considered to be the best&#151;or rather the &quot;least worst&quot;&#151;method for the time being, although other options were put forward and questions were raised about how the licence fee is set, collected and distributed.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>The findings contained in this report will feed directly into the review of the BBC&#039;s charter. As I have said on numerous occasions, the only certain outcome of charter review will be a strong BBC, independent of government.
</p>

<a name="40720-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>I have placed copies of <i>What You Said . . .  </i>and the supporting research in the Library of the House. Further copies are available from the charter review web site: www.bbccharterreview.org.uk.

<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="40720w01_wqn0"></a><b> Baroness Gale </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What assessment they have made of the relationship between the millennium development target to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds and similar targets for halving the proportion of people without safe water or basic sanitation.  [HL3490]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="40720w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  The millennium targets to reduce under-five mortality and to reduce the proportion of people without safe water and basic sanitation are very closely linked. Unsafe water and poor sanitation causes high rates of diarrhoeal disease. Use of powdered milk and unsafe water instead of breastfeeding contributes to diarrhoeal disease in infants.
</p>

<a name="40720w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>Diarrhoeal disease is a major contributor to child mortality globally and also to high levels of under-nutrition. Provision of effective healthcare, whether in the home, the community or through formal health institutions (adequate rehydration and specific drug treatment where indicated) can treat the problem and prevent death from diarrhoea. However, it does not address the direct cause of diarrhoea. Significant progress in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal disease will only be achieved through the integrated provision of safe water, in or as near to the house as possible, sanitation and hygiene promotion.

<a name="40720w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  Skills for Life caters for the literacy and numeracy skills needs of post-16 learners; that is, those who are no longer in compulsory education. The national strategy has an initial target to improve the skills of 750,000 adults by 2004. Individuals count towards the target if they improve their skills evidenced by achieving a relevant national qualification, including key skills in communication and application of number at Levels 1 and 2, and GCSEs in English and maths.

Our aim is to ensure that all Sure Start local programmes develop into children&#039;s centres and work effectively with their local authorities to share their good practice, including around parental engagement. Local authorities have been given specific responsibility to ensure that parents are consulted about the services they need, and for their delivery through children&#039;s centres. The Sure Start Unit is working closely with local authorities and will continue to promote the need for children&#039;s centres to consult regularly with parents, and review service provision as their needs change.

because many parents apply for places at more than one school and it is not clear which is their first preference.

<br>

<br>

Figures for 2002&#150;03 are not directly comparable with those for earlier years. A new method of allocating students to subject groups was introduced in 2002&#150;03, the effect of which was to decrease the number of students in the &quot;combined&quot; categories and increase those who were allocated to specific subjects. This means that the figures for 2002&#150;03 are not directly comparable with those for earlier years.<br>

To meet the forecast increase in calls in January this year DVLA initially added 60 extra lines to the existing 160 on the vehicle service. The success of the continuous registration led to a far greater than expected demand. As a result DVLA added a further 35 lines in May. This now gives a total of 255 lines for vehicle services.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_56"></a>Whether an audit has been undertaken on the number of accredited recreational facilities on the River Thames and the funding committed to their maintenance and upkeep in each year since 2000.  [HL3706]
</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_48"></a>
<a name="40720w06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   As far as we are aware, no central audit has been undertaken of accredited recreational facilities on the River Thames but the Environment Agency has provided information on the number of locks and the costs of maintaining them.
</p>

<a name="40720w06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a>There are 44 locks on the River Thames. Expenditure on their maintenance and improvement since 2000 has been as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_2"></a>2000&#150;01:   &#163;2.76 million

<p><a name="wa_qn_48"></a>
<a name="40720w06_wqn3"></a><b> Lord Moynihan </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_57"></a>What is their best estimate of the net financial contribution to the economy of leisure activity on the River Thames.  [HL3708]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_49"></a>
<a name="40720w06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   An economic assessment carried out by independent consultants in 2001 estimated that, in that year, boating-related activity on the non-tidal Thames employed 17,000 people and generated a spend of &#163;85 million. Other leisure activity and tourism in the riverside wards of the non-tidal river employed 55,000 people and generated a further spend of &#163;119 million.

<p><a name="wa_qn_49"></a>
<a name="40720w06_wqn4"></a><b> Lord Moynihan </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_58"></a>What plans they have to increase participation in sport and recreation on the rivers and waterways of the United Kingdom.  [HL3710]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_50"></a>
<a name="40720w06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   The Government gave a commitment to increase access to water in <i>Working for the Essentials of Life,</i> published in 2002. We also commissioned a study from Brighton University study to establish what recreational opportunities are currently available. The report of that study, <i>Water-based sport and recreation: the Facts</i> was published in 2001.
</p>

<a name="40720w06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a>The Brighton study found that supply and demand for water-based recreation is broadly in balance but it identified some unmet demand for white water and long distance routes for canoeists in some parts of the country.
</p>

<a name="40720w06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a>In light of these findings, my right honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality asked the Countryside Agency to undertake a feasibility study into improving access for canoeists by voluntary agreement. The study <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA43"></a>

focused on four pilot areas and the findings indicate that voluntary agreements can be made to work in certain circumstances. My right honourable friend is now considering the report&#039;s recommendations that agreements be completed in the pilot areas.
</p>

<a name="40720w06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a>In addition, the Environment Agency has embarked on a programme of developing regional strategies for water-based sport and recreation and its annual conservation, access and recreation reports made <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40720w06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a>The Environment Agency is also leading on the development of strategic partnerships and alliances which include public, commercial and voluntary sectors to upgrade facilities on the agencies&#039; navigable rivers which are backed by marketing and promotion initiatives.
