<A NAME="30408-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Barnett </B>  asked the Leader of the House:
<P>
<P>

<a name="30408-01_para3"></a>What would be a reasonable time between publication of a Select Committee report and a debate on the report on the Floor of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, what is a reasonable interval varies case by case. It depends on various factors, including when the Government's written response is issued, whether the debate is to take place before or after that response and the point in the Session at which the report is published. It also depends on chairmen's requirements, including whether they try to insist on prime time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, not being chairman of any particular committee, I am not sure what my noble and learned friend is talking about. I know his interest is at the heart of all this and government priorities obviously matter. On the other hand, is he aware that the Select Committee on Economic Affairs has produced a major report on globalisation that was published on 18th November and no date has yet even been proposed? Will my noble and learned friend accept&#151;knowing what an agreeable man he is, I am sure that he will&#151;that the work of Select Committees is effectively destroyed if there is such a long delay between the publication of a report and its debate? If he agrees with that, as I am sure he will, what does he propose to do about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend said that I am always agreeable and that is, in fact, true. I am about to demonstrate that by partly agreeing with him. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, will wish me to recount the facts. The EAC published that report on globalisation on 17th January. The <P>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government responded on 21st March. We offered a debate in prime time on Monday 17th March. That was not acceptable. We offered a three-and-a-half-hour debate on Thursday 10th April. That was not acceptable. If the esteemed chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee wished to have a debate on a Friday, we could have accommodated him at very short notice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House agree that it is slightly ironic that this House has probably the most respected system of reporting on European Union affairs in the form of written reports, and probably the most dilatory provisions for debating them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and I have been in contact on this. We are looking forward to the debate on 9th May. His committee may have the answer to the problem, which is to have debates in prime time in Grand Committee&#151;that is one possibility&#151;or to have debates in the Unstarred Question time for an hour and a half.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, as the esteemed chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee&#151;although, unlike my noble and learned friend, I am extremely disagreeable&#151;I ask him to recognise that for once he has not quite got his facts right. I was offered four or five dates at different times. What they all had in common was that every time I accepted one it was then taken away from me, including the two that my noble and learned friend mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30408-01_para4"></a>To be constructive, will my noble and learned friend bear two things in mind? First, some reports, such as another one from the committee that I chair to do with the present state of the economy, have value only if they are debated fairly soon after they appear. Otherwise, it is a complete waste of time. The second thought that noble Lords generally might like to consider is whether we could add your Lordships' Select Committees to the group who can have debates on Wednesday afternoons. We could also expand the capacity of Wednesday afternoons by having three two-and-a-half-hour debates that day. One could take one's chances on whether one was first, second or third. That way, we could increase our ability to debate these topics and allow the Select Committees to have as good a chance as the political parties and others.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the esteemed chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee said that he was disagreeable. He was offered three hours' prime time on Monday 17th March, but he did not wish to accept that. We offered three and a half hours on Thursday 10th April and he did not want to accept that. As far as Wednesday is concerned, subject to the recommendations of the Procedure Committee, I would be very content to try to accommodate. However, we have a heavy legislative programme&#151;an appropriately heavy one&#151;and we have legitimate <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>demands for Statements on Iraq, for instance, which rightly take up our time. There is the alternative, which we shall look at on 9th May, of having debates in Grand Committee. There is no reason apart from inertia and the fact that it has never been done before&#151;neither of which qualifies as a reason&#151;why we should not do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord not think that there is every reason why we should not do it? The whole purpose of a debate is to have the whole House. We do not want to go into a little committee room and have a debate there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is not a little committee room. It is the Moses Room, which has been admirably refurbished under the direction of Black Rod. It is hardly a lurch from the Chamber. In fact, if one actually comes to debates very often, as I frequently do, one will know that the House is by no means filled to over-capacity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House is to be congratulated on his suggestion of the Moses Room. It shows his skills. If we did have any debate there it could not possibly do any harm because no one can hear a word that is said there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I therefore understand the merits of the Moses Room. The noble Lord is for once quite wrong. Had he been to the Moses Room recently, he would know that it is perfectly easy to hear what all the contributions have to offer. Whether that is an advance I leave to your Lordships. However, it is perfectly easy to understand everyone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Jopling: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House understand that very many noble Lords feel that if these reports are shuffled off to a Grand Committee and downgraded in that way the press, who take little enough interest in our affairs anyway, will take even less interest?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, what we have done on this particular report on globalisation is to offer two periods of prime time&#151;Fridays in the Chamber where all noble Lords who have an interest can attend. What I am trying to do is to accommodate the reasonable request of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, to have debates reasonably promptly after the reports are published. With the best will in the world, if your Lordships are not willing to sit in the morning&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord about his rather bizarre suggestion that these debates on Select Committees should take place on Wednesdays, which are days set <P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aside for debates for the different political parties? I hope that he will not assume that his suggestion would be generally acceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the suggestion may or may not have been bizarre, but I was not its father. The paternity belongs to my noble friend Lord Peston.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend is being very generous with time, which is not generally welcome. Is he flexible enough to agree that better use could be made of the time that is available to us? For example, I understand that, next week, we shall debate North Atlantic salmon&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew15"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Perhaps the debate is tomorrow, my Lords. I am sure that noble Lords are fascinated with the subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew17"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Yes!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   I am sure that they are, my Lords. However, I hope that my noble and learned friend will accept that globalisation is a rather bigger issue than Atlantic salmon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew19"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, have we spent only six minutes on this Question or has the clock stopped? May we have a few minutes more to discuss Atlantic salmon or globalisation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, if we are having a debate on North Atlantic salmon next week, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, will be the only one present.
<P>

<a name="30408-01_para5"></a>Your Lordships cannot endlessly have the penny and the bun. If we wish to sit truncated hours, as we do, then something has to give. There is no real reason why we should not work on Fridays or in the morning.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that a large cause of the problem of pressure in your Lordships' House is the abominable state in which most of the Bills arrive in this House from the other end?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not, actually. I think that we have had a very improved experience, and government amendments have fallen significantly in number. The real answer, I feel, with important legislation, is always to start it in this House so that it is in perfect form by the time that it goes to the Commons for their scrutiny.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Byford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<a name="30408-02_para0"></a>What provisions are in place to deal with fallen stock.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, discussions on the fallen stock issue are continuing with the industries concerned. However, the Government have been prepared to make an initial contribution to an industry-operated voluntary subscription scheme for the collection and disposal of fallen stock. There are a number of other ways in which farmers can comply with the new rules, including the use of incinerators, knackers' yards and rendering plants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response. Is he not concerned that some of the proposals will increase the risk of spreading infection? Does he agree that burial on site, which has been going on for many years, is in fact the best way of dealing with fallen stock? Does he also agree that the whole push of the Animal Health Bill was to tighten security and prevent the spread of disease? One of the options to which he referred, involving the transport of diseased animals around the countryside, is in fact likely to cause the spread of disease.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Baroness. The new European regulations are a recognition that the burial of stock, particularly in areas close to watercourses and in much other land, can cause long-remaining disease and other problems. Certainly it is necessary for all farmers and transporters to observe tight biosecurity both on the farm and in the transportation of live and dead stock. That would remain the case and the necessity under any of these options.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister realise that he has every livestock farmer in the United Kingdom up in arms over the Government's failure to come to a solution with the National Farmers Union of each country? Does he further agree that Scottish Ministers have given an extension from 1st May until the issue is resolved? Why cannot that be done in England?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, far be it from me to interpret exactly what the Scottish Executive has done within its own powers, but effectively it cannot alter the date of the application. Although it has indicated that the rules may not be enforced as substantially from day one, because of uncertainty, there are issues relating to how they will be enforced initially. There has been failure to establish an adequate collection service because, despite many meetings with the NFU and the farming unions, we have not agreed a satisfactory contribution. The farming unions have <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>declined to accept any system that involves the industry itself making a contribution to a national collection scheme. Therefore, we are left to fall back on individual farmers making individual arrangements with transporters and disposal operatives. That is not a sensible solution. It may be a solution in certain circumstances but it is not a sensible solution for everyone. I am glad to say that we have now returned to constructive relations and discussions with both the farmers' unions and the disposal and transport industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, as he probably read in Farmers Weekly, many trading standards officers regard the directives as unenforceable and that one-third of farmers in Wales are more than 100 kilometres from a rendering plant, which makes things extremely difficult? Does he also agree that five EU countries do not charge their farmers for such a collection service? Why is that not the case here?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, at least nine other EU countries are charging farmers to some degree. Unlike the noble Lord, I do not necessarily believe every word in Farmers Weekly. Clearly a question arises as to how we are to enforce the system, but trading standards operatives will have to get used to it, as will farmers and disposal units. However, the whole point is that we have the necessary capacity in this country in terms of both transportation and rendering, and other methods are available, as I have outlined. This system could be made to work but some of the cost must fall on the industry itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, what is the situation with regard to islands? For example, is there still an abattoir on the Isle of Wight? If an animal breaks a leg, is there an alternative, apart from having to cart the animal in pain in a boat to the mainland to have it put down? What is the position? There must be many islands around the UK where matters will become very tricky if farmers are not allowed to deal with the situation themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, so far as concerns the situation to which the noble Baroness refers, rendering capacity, incineration and vets still exist on the Isle of Wight. As I understand it, there is not a fully commercial abattoir, although I shall correct that if I am wrong. Only the remotest areas are exempt from the rules under European legislation. Those areas will include some of the Scottish islands and highlands but not normally the Isle of Wight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the sentence for an offence under these regulations is a maximum of two years' imprisonment? Does he anticipate that the sentence will be applied per lamb, so that a person burying two dead lambs will be liable for four years' imprisonment, and so on? How can the system work?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, they are maximum sentences, and clearly each individual case will be a <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter for the court. The Government's aim is to put in place a system which works and which will require relatively light enforcement. I believe that, once we agree the nature of the system with the industry, that will be deliverable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Kimball: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the Cottesmore Hunt, which is listed as a collection point for fallen stock. Does the Minister realise that, as from 1st May, no renderer will come to pick up stock? I have rung the whole lot in the East Midlands area but none will come. It would cost us more than &pound;40 to take a dead sheep from the collection point to the renderers. That is more than it is worth to the farmer and most farmers would not pay. Will the Minister give careful consideration to extending the existing scheme for cattle over 30 months so that all livestock delivered to a collection point can be taken to the renderer with a payment for rendering and transport?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, obviously I cannot comment on the particular circumstances that the noble Lord described. However, the whole point of the Government's offer to set up a collection and disposal system is that the scheme available for cattle over the age of 30 months should be extended to deal with fallen stock. The scheme covers the country and can deal with the collection of animals and species that are fallen stock other than 30 month-old cattle. That offer then needs to be supplemented by a contribution from the industry, either directly or in the form of a levy. It is hoped that we can reach agreement on the system with the NFU within the next few days.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, what advice would the noble Lord give to a farmer who, say, lives and works in the Pennines? When the new regulations come into being, if that farmer goes on to the hill and finds that perhaps half a dozen sheep have been suffocated in a snowstorm during the night, will he be expected to bring them all the way back? Can I further suggest to the noble Lord that he and some of his officials visit that type of countryside to see what it is like for themselves? They would then realise how utterly daft these regulations are.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, given the scientific and geological information that we have, the alternative suggested by the noble Earl is that we leave or bury animals on the hillside. However, that could pollute our water courses and so forth. Clearly we need to make practical arrangements in order to gather up and dispose of such stock. Some will be dealt with in farm incinerators and some through transportation. We need transportation and we probably need a collection and disposal system of the type that the Government are now discussing with the NFU. But let there be no doubt that this is ultimately a public health and environmental problem. The alternative is to allow the potential threat to persist.

<a name="30408-02_para1"></a>Whether prisoners of war taken in Iraq will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030408/text/30408-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, the Government have long made plain that they will act in conformity with international law. The taking of prisoners of war is a recognised and legitimate means of reducing an enemy's strength and fighting capacity. Iraqi military personnel who fall into the hands of United Kingdom forces are prisoners of war and therefore will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for that reply from the Minister. However, perhaps I may ask him about the position of those who are known as &quot;unlawful combatants" and who may be paramilitaries of one form or another. Does the Minister agree that those people fall under Article 5 of the third Geneva Convention, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, and should therefore, as in the first Gulf War, be brought before a competent tribunal to determine their status? Can the Minister assure us that neither POWs nor this group of people will in any circumstances be sent to Guantanamo Bay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, if such people are taken into the custody of the United Kingdom forces, they will be treated under the terms of humanitarian law and will of course be looked after both humanely and safely. If they are passed on to another coalition partner&#151;for example, the United States&#151;to be guarded, then an arrangement is in place between the coalition forces that the following will happen. First, there will be no transfer outside the borders of Iraq without the consent of the detaining power, which will in those circumstances be the United Kingdom. Secondly, jurisdiction will be exclusive to the detaining power&#151;at least for events that occurred before their first detention. Thirdly, as the noble Baroness suggests, where there is any doubt about their status&#151;sometimes there may be no doubt about it either way&#151;the United Kingdom may well have to convene tribunals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House how many Iraqi prisoners of war are being detained by British forces and how long it will take to process them and to record their relevant details in accordance with the Geneva Conventions? In addition, how many British troops are required to guard and protect them and what amount of food, water and medical supplies are allocated to them in accordance with the Geneva Conventions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, as of this morning, the United Kingdom forces were guarding more than 6,500 coalition prisoners. They are being held in the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>United Kingdom divisional compound in Iraq, and UK forces are deployed to guard the prisoners of war. The numbers depend on the circumstances in force at the time. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will understand if I do not give more precise details.
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para0"></a>We are processing the prisoners as fast as possible; the Red Crescent is content with the action that we are taking in that regard. Prisoners are of course being given sufficient food, water and access to the medical facilities that they require.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all views about the war, whether favourable or critical, converge in pressing for every aspect of the Geneva Convention to be applied. Does the Minister agree that it is vital at this stage of the war that we are seen to be applying every aspect of the convention to all prisoners of war, regardless of various grey shades of identity? Does he further agree that the recent response of the Secretary of State for Defence to a question on &quot;Newsnight"&#151;

is, although understandable in the circumstances, perhaps less than satisfactory?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, with great respect to the right reverend Prelate, I do not agree that that is unsatisfactory. We are still considering the issues concerning prisoners of war and others; that needs extremely delicate handling. Of course, if they are within our jurisdiction, as it were, they will remain so and we will make the decisions about them.
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para2"></a>Of course we hope that the conflict will end sooner rather than later and that prisoners of war can return to their homes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, the other day the Minister gave in his Statement a figure of 9,000 prisoners of war. Today's figure is 6,500. Will he explain the discrepancy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving me that opportunity. It is clear that the response that I gave did not contain the right figure; there was confusion about that. As soon as that came to my notice, I wrote to the relevant Front-Benchers on all sides of the House, and to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and placed a copy in the Library of the House containing the true figures. I apologise for having given that figure last Thursday but, of course, the figures change every day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, will the Government give some priority to Kuwaiti prisoners of war and those missing in action since the previous Gulf War?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that that question has been asked, because it is one matter about which the Iraqi regime has been asked ever since the first Gulf War ended. I believe that there are 600 Kuwaiti prisoners whose whereabouts are completely <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unknown. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iraqi regime has done absolutely nothing to assist the Kuwaiti authorities on that matter. We shall certainly be looking into that as matters develop.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that it would be contrary to international law for coalition forces to imprison unarmed civilians merely because they happen to belong to a certain political party?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, merely because they happen to belong to a particular political party? Yes, of course that would be unlawful. But we have the power to capture and detain combatants and others who pose a direct threat to United Kingdom forces or whose continued liberty poses a threat to our overall mission. If one or other of those requirements is met, we are entitled under international law to detain them.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para3"></a>How they intend to ensure that Parliament is fully consulted on the conclusions of the European Union Convention on the Future of Europe before the start of the proposed intergovernmental conference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, the Government have made clear the importance that we attach to full parliamentary consultation on the conclusions of the Convention on the Future of Europe before the start of the intergovernmental conference. We expect the convention to conclude in June, as mandated, but the date of the IGC is not yet decided. The Government have made clear that any dates for the IGC must allow for proper and substantial parliamentary discussion of the issues and full participation of the accession states.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. It occurred to me when she commented last week that the convention will end at the end of June, that the intergovernmental conference is likely to start at the end of September and that that does not provide an especially convenient intervening space for full consultation with national parliaments.
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para4"></a>Given that the Prime Minister himself has made clear on several occasions that the role of national parliaments in the European Union is one of the issues in the convention to which we attach most importance, can we ensure by one means or another&#151;with time made available and the appropriate documents and government proposals published for discussion in both Chambers of this Parliament&#151;for full consultation to be provided between the end of the convention and whenever the start of the IGC is agreed to be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the Prime Minister has made clear that he regards the role <P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Parliament as an important issue in the convention. It would therefore be perverse not to allow the role of Parliament to be properly exercised between the end of the convention and the IGC. The noble Lord mentioned the possible date of September. The fact is that it was originally expected that the IGC would be held in 2004, but, as I am sure that the noble Lord is aware, some European Union countries are pressing to begin the IGC in 2003.
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para5"></a>Nothing has been decided and no dates have been alighted on as suitable. I am acutely aware of the concerns in this House, which I am sure reflect concerns in another place, that proper time must be allowed for the substantial and proper parliamentary discussion to which I referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, have not recent events in Europe&#151;I know that the Minister has such great love for the behaviour of her French and German counterparts recently&#151;made the plans drawn up by the European convention a matter of fairy stories rather than of the future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I indeed have great affection for our friends in France and Germany&#151;I thank the noble Earl for remarking on it. As your Lordships discussed in the debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, last week, several extensive issues, such as economic governance, legal personality and how we can go forward on the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy, are involved. They are all important and need to be resolved.
<P>

<a name="30408-03_para6"></a>The point is that your Lordships and another place should have a proper opportunity to discuss them at the conclusion of the convention, at the end of June, and before the beginning of the IGC, which is when decisions will be taken in the European Union on the basis of unanimity.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that her reference to legal personality illustrates in just one way the relationship between the future of European institutions as a whole? Can she assure the House that before we enter those essential deliberations, the Government will clarify their position on the future of the Council of Europe and its conventions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the Government will need to clarify our position on a number of issues. If I may say so, that is the sort of debate to which your Lordships are peculiarly well placed to contribute. The fact is that we have worked extremely well with our European partners in the convention, but they, too, will be considering the convention conclusions before the IGC.
<P>

<a name="30408-04_para0"></a>Your Lordships and the Government may take one view, but we must acknowledge that entirely different views may come from our partners elsewhere in the EU. The important thing is to have those discussions <P>


<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before the IGC. I stress again that nothing will be fixed until the IGC has decided the position; and it will do so on the basis of a unanimous vote.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, is it not wishful thinking to assume that in present circumstances&#151;my noble friend Lord Onslow has drawn attention to them&#151;the convention can possibly reach agreement by June, in six weeks' time? Has not the draft constitution been bombarded with hundreds, if not thousands, of amendments? Is not the draft of the praesidium miles away from the view of the rank and file?
<P>

<a name="30408-04_para1"></a>Would it not be better to give up the attempt to have a new Treaty of Rome&#151;on which, I gather, our Italian friends are so keen&#151;and to aim more sensibly for the end of the year, when, one hopes, there will be a little more agreement? By this time next year, the new applicant countries, which, after all, will have to live inside the changed Union and new constitution, will have a chance to consider it. Why the rush?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is a rush. Many amendments to the convention are being put forward, but we expected no less than that. As I indicated, at a working level the convention is working very well together. After all, three of our own Members are involved on the convention. My noble friend Lady Scotland, who is sitting beside me, is the Government's alternate on the convention, but noble Lords are also very ably represented by the noble Lords, Lord Maclennan and Lord Tomlinson. They are sensible people who can discuss with their colleagues from the other European countries the conclusions that they wish to reach over the convention. I am assured that the convention is still on track to reach its final conclusion by the end of June as originally mandated. There is no rush. The convention is working sensibly and properly together, as noble Lords would expect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, having just returned from last week's session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and witnessed the overwhelming animosity towards the United Kingdom by most European parliamentarians, does the Minister not agree that it would be better to postpone the conclusions of the convention until present divisions in Europe have receded and there is a more friendly atmosphere?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we have our differences with our colleagues in Europe. That is absolutely clear. Nobody has tried to hide any of those differences. We all know that they centre on the very, very difficult question of the military conflict in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30408-04_para2"></a>The noble Lord refers to &quot;animosity"; I refer to it as differences. I assure noble Lords that differences are not marring the discussions in the convention. My noble friend Lady Scotland assures me that the discussions in the convention are continuing in a constructive way that noble Lords would expect. Noble <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Lords are at liberty to ask our other noble colleagues, who are not with us today because they are no doubt working on those issues, but we believe that we are on track to finish the convention.
<P>

<a name="30408-04_para3"></a>I remind noble Lords that the convention conclusions bind us to nothing&#151;that is the point&#151;and not only your Lordships but colleagues in another place will be able to discuss the convention before we return to the IGC, where the real intergovernmental negotiations will have to take place.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<a name="30408-04_para4"></a>Whether they plan to intervene in the negotiations among Corus, the LNM Group and Brazilian companies to take over Corus's steel-making plants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Corus is in discussion with bankers to renegotiate long-term funding and is developing plans to enable it to return to profitability. The Government are in regular contact with Corus at the highest levels and have been given assurances by the company that it is planning for a viable future in the UK. Any commercial negotiations would be a matter for the company.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that steel-making is likely to be terminated in the UK if the interest shown by the LNM Group, headed by Lakshmi Mittal, and CSN Brazil results in the takeover of Corus's UK steel-making plants? That would put 26,000 employees in Port Talbot, Teesside and Scunthorpe out of work, with a huge knock-on effect on local employment. It would be catastrophic. The financial pages of the newspapers show that that interest exists. Will the Government, therefore, purchase the British arm of Corus and restructure it as with MG Rover or temporarily take it into the public sector? After all, steel is fundamental to the security of the manufacturing industry in the UK. UK Corus's shares are worth only 8p&#151;a total of &pound;260 million&#151;which is surely a snip at present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I know that Corus is criticised for failing to respond to media speculation. Sometimes it is a little tight-lipped, but we can see why. The sort of media speculation with which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, now regales the House is enormously damaging to Corus's suppliers, customers and employees. I do not think that we should take part in that kind of speculation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Brookman: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the ex-general-secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation community union. Bearing in mind the reply that the Minister has just given, but nevertheless taking account of Corus's annual report, in which the <P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>chairman stated that there will be further restructuring in the company, does the Minister not view it as essential that the trade unions meet the Government and the board of the company to try to avoid what has happened over the past few years; that is to say, some 10,000 job losses? It is essential that steps are take to avoid further tragedies in what was once a great company.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Brookman, that it is essential that the Government keep in close contact with both the management and the unions in Corus. I can assure him that that is the case. Patricia Hewitt has met Sir Brian Moffat and Michael Leahy of the ISTC on a number of occasions recently and will continue to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Morris of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, at present, have the Government any powers to prevent an asset-stripper from purchasing Corus or any part of it for the purpose of disposal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that there is any adequate definition of what is meant by an asset-stripper. Clearly, Corus is a commercial company. It can conduct any negotiations it chooses, and it is doing so. We are concerned about the assurance that Corus has given to us about the plans for a viable future in the United Kingdom. Subject to that assurance, if I were the management of Corus, I would be talking to anybody who could help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, given the perilous state of the British steel industry, can the Minister confirm that, contrary to a European Commission recommendation, the British Government in a fairly recent meeting of the Council of Ministers opposed the application for anti-dumping measures against unfairly traded imports of hot-rolled coil from Egypt, Slovakia and Turkey? If that was their stance, what is the explanation for it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I understand that, strictly speaking, we opposed it only in relation to Egypt. The position of the accession states, principally Slovakia and Poland, is quite different. There is an issue there of the possibility of state aid, but it would be only for the purposes of reducing capacity. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Davies, agrees that, from the United Kingdom's point of view, a reduction in capacity elsewhere in Europe is very desirable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, if the worst scenario did arise and steel-making in the United Kingdom came virtually to an end&#151;presumably, the Government do not want that result&#151;are the Government prepared to do something to prevent the closure of our steel industry? If so, what are they prepared to do?

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-05_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO VOTERS
<br>
(1) Information shall be circulated to voters before any order is made for a referendum providing details of&#151;
<br>
(a) the powers, responsibilities and constitutional arrangements of elected regional assemblies;
<br>
(b) the costs incurred by the boundary committee and the forecasted costs of any subsequent local government reorganisation;

<a name="30408-05_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to speak probably for the last time on this type of amendment, asking for information about powers, responsibilities and constitutional arrangements, about the costs forecast to be incurred by the Boundary Committee&#151;we know that the Government have done work on this&#151;the administrative and initial starting costs for the establishment of regional assemblies and the predicted annual costs of the running of the regional assemblies, on which the Government have also done some work. The amendment would ensure that voters are able to make an informed choice, when they vote in a referendum on the options. The relevant information must include information about costs and the sources of the money.
<P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para6"></a>I shall not dwell on the first part of the amendment. The case that voters should be informed about what they are voting for is irrefutable. I am sure that the Minister will agree with that, as he has done all the way through our deliberations on the Bill so far. The rest of the amendment relates to the provision of information about the costs of creating an elected regional assembly. Information about the cost of an elected regional assembly is important. It was important enough for the Labour Party to include in its 1997 manifesto a commitment that the exercise should be &quot;cost-neutral". We support that proposition, and I would be interested to know whether the Minister holds to that manifesto pledge. Do the Government now believe that it is right that the reorganisation should divert funds away from investment in our public services? We should make no mistake about it: if the scheme is not cost-neutral, the only money that could be provided for it is money that could be spent on public services.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para7"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will say that it is difficult to calculate the costs accurately. That is not what the amendment asks for, and, anyway, I agree. However, that does not mean that no attempt should be made to do so, and, as I said, we know that the Government have done something about it.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para8"></a>We have been through reorganisations before. I hope that we have all learnt a lot from them. There is information from the previous round of local government reorganisation&#151;10 years ago&#151;that has been independently analysed. The work of the Local Government Commission, as analysed by Professor Michael Chisholm, suggests, for example, that the costs of local government reorganisation would be well over &pound;2 billion. That figure is widely regarded as an under-estimation of the true cost.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para9"></a>The Government might also argue that, although there will be initial costs, there will be savings in the long run. Again, it is difficult to see how they reach that conclusion. Local government reorganisations tend not to cut costs. The reform of local government in the early 1970s led to an increase in staffing of nearly 5 per cent and to the spiralling costs that led to the financial crisis that precipitated the Layfield inquiry.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para10"></a>If one applies to West Sussex the Ernst & Young model accepted by the Local Government Commission to assess costs and savings associated with reorganisation to a unitary authority, one can see that only on the basis of a unitary county would the transitional costs be repaid within a reasonable timescale. Even if one inflated the savings estimates from the model by 10 per cent and reduced the cost estimates by the same amount, one can see that reorganisations into more than one unitary tier of government do not pay the transitional costs.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para11"></a>Where will the money come from to pay for the transitional costs? In the previous round of local government reorganisation, according to Chisholm, upwards of 30 per cent of the costs of reorganisation were met from local authority reserves and revenue accounts. Is that to be the case again? The answer is clear: local people will, in the end, be asked to pay. <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They will pay through their council tax, and they will pay through a reduction in the quality of service delivery. The Government will, no doubt, have their own figures. I would be glad to hear them and would welcome a chance to examine the cost models on which they are based.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para12"></a>It is important that we have a debate on the matter. People must be provided with the information that will enable them to make an informed decision. That is the purpose of the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-05_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships will not be surprised if I return to the question of powers. Yesterday, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that he would not adjourn the House until I got a reply to the Written Question that DEFRA refused to answer. Sadly, I did not hold the Minister to that. If I had, we would not have adjourned, and we would have lost today's business. I have still not got a reply.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para13"></a>I leave it to your Lordships to decide whether that is deliberate obstruction or sheer incompetence on the part of the Government. I do not know. It is difficult to take part in a debate about an amendment relating to powers, when I do not have the Answer to my Written Question. I hope that the Minister will regain his touch. Perhaps, he should be in charge of more than one department. He got me a quick reply from his department; if he ran more than one department, we might all get quick replies. I shall have to come back to the matter when I have the information to hand.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para14"></a>Paragraph (d) of the amendment refers to the costs. My noble friend Lady Blatch has made all the relevant points, and I agree with her that the people who will pick up the tab will be the council tax payers, which will mean a reduction in services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I have great sympathy with my noble friend Lord Caithness on the question of powers. I speak in the light of yesterday's experience, which was such a sad occasion for me. I started by giving the Government every chance to illuminate the darkness of my mind and clarify, I think, eight or nine points that I raised. Noble Lords will imagine the depths of my sorrow, when I received absolutely no enlightenment.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para15"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, who replied to the debate, would have done his utmost to help me; he is always helpful. On this occasion, however, either no one told him what the answers were or there were no answers because nobody had even worked them out. I acquit the noble Lord of any intention to disappoint me.
<P>

<a name="30408-05_para16"></a>I notice that the amendment moved today by my noble friend Lady Blatch, with her customary eloquence, is very similar to the amendment that I moved yesterday. I can hardly resist the temptation to express something of the disappointment and mortification that I felt when my amendment of yesterday and the remarks that I made then evoked no attention from my Front Bench, except a desire to get on with the business. I had not, at that point, obstructed the business&#151;but be that as it may.

<P>

<a name="30408-05_para17"></a>Today, I shall resist the temptation to repeat all my questions of yesterday. I shall content myself with this semi-simple question: what powers will the assemblies have? There is a second question: where will they come from? We cannot just manufacture powers. The new powers that we are to give to the assemblies must come from somewhere. That will cause Ministers great discomfort. I cannot recall a government being anxious to shed powers. It is rather to the taste of Ministers to enlarge their empire, not to shrink it. I mean no disrespect to that very important personage the Deputy Prime Minister, but he is the last Minister who is inclined to shrink his empire, which now stretches over many pages in the Civil Service Yearbook.

<a name="30408-05_para18"></a>Where are the assemblies' powers going to come from? Which Ministers are going to say, &quot;We have more powers than we need, so we will give them to these worthy assemblies"? There are difficulties: no one has decided how many members will be in the assemblies and where they will come from. A great deal is undecided. It would be nice if one or two of the Minister's colleagues were to say, &quot;We realise that this is an important occasion for self-sacrifice and we are prepared willingly to part with some of our powers". The answers to those questions would be fascinating. I assure the Minister that if he will be so gracious as to let me have a reply I shall maintain a peaceful silence thereafter.

<A NAME="30408-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, the Minister still owes me a reply to a question I posed some time ago. I asked what would happen if there was a local government review followed by a referendum resulting in a no vote and who would bear the thrown-away costs. The Minister was unable to give me an answer when I last posed the question. Will he now assure me that unfortunate council tax payers will not bear the cost of such an abortive review?

<A NAME="30408-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, yesterday my noble friend Lord Peyton referred to my &quot;terrifying glance". I hope that by now he has decided that I am less of a Rottweiler. I am delighted that he has returned to this tack today in his eloquent fashion. One of the most important aspects of the Bill is what information will be available to voters about the proposed role of regional assemblies before the election takes place.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para0"></a>We discussed at great length whether a regional assemblies Bill should have been produced before this Bill. We now have a commitment from the Government that a draft Bill will be published if possible. I hope that we will yet have a commitment that it will be produced. It has taken us hours to unpick what the regional assemblies will amount to. Had that information been available at an earlier stage we could have saved a great deal of time.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para1"></a>The voters must know before they start to decide how they are going to vote in a referendum what regional assemblies are going to do; what their responsibilities will be; and where they will fit constitutionally within the system. We have heard from the Minister that <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regional government will not be a local authority. It is another completely odd governmental arrangement. We must also know about the costs that will result from a vote in favour of regional government which untangles again the Boundaries Committee. We also need to know the administrative start-up costs for the establishment of the regional assemblies. In the past we have had explained the costs in terms of London and Scotland; it is important that the voters know what they are in for.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para2"></a>Those are at least four of the main elements of information that we require. We have also discussed other information which the Minister has indicated will be available to voters in advance. I hope that the Minister will give us the reassurance we seek that all the information we have asked for will be made available to voters prior to any order for a referendum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the importance of information cannot be exaggerated. We have debated it before and I believe the Minister agrees and will remind us of the different roles of the Government, the Electoral Commission and the participants campaigning on both sides. To take up the last comment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham: is the list complete? The costs are mentioned, but they are one side of a debit/credit account. One is going over a line about information into political argument for and against regional assemblies and the cost benefit analysis of a strategic regional tier and improved decision making closer to where the implications will be felt. Can the list be complete in legislation? I am sure that the Electoral Commission will want to draw many matters to voters' attention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, there is a saying by Raymond Chandler that if you are writing a thriller and are in doubt as to what should happen next, you should always have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand. The Minister has been admirable in his response to our debates throughout Committee and Report stages, but when confronted with Raymond Chandler's problem he has a habit of falling back on the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para3"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that my exchange with the noble Lord, Lord Evans, on the Prime Minister's and the Deputy Prime Minister's reference to regionally elected assemblies was a try-on. I should have realised that Ministers like the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are above having their forewords and prefaces checked by civil servants to make sure that they are not speaking nonsense from which the Government have to resile at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para4"></a>The Minister may not always be with us, as I have remarked previously. His confidence that everyone will know exactly on what they are voting in a referendum would not necessarily be sustained if another Minister were in charge of the proceedings at the time we arrived at them. I strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I take on the last point of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. Forewords are always <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>slipped in at the last minute after the work has been done. They can pass one by. I guarantee, however, that they are read. The last time I was invited to sign one, I said, &quot;I'm not having my name on that and you can take the photograph out as well". I am not saying what it was. It was a purely factual document; not policy. I assure the noble Lord that Ministers read forewords.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para5"></a>I take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, on one point. The Government are not starving public services of money. I shall not recite what happened to public services in the 1980s and 1990s, but the modest amount of public expenditure involved here does not starve public services of money. I have no doubt that my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will produce tomorrow some more up-to-date figures on the vast legitimate expenditure on public services. The noble Baroness need not worry on that score.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para6"></a>I do not want to get off on the wrong foot, but the amendment's main purpose is to delay. It can sound sweet because everything looks great until you read it. It states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xbefore any order is made"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-06_para7"></a>
which is the phrase on which it all hangs&#151;information needs to be placed before the public.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para8"></a>As I have repeatedly said&#151;and I am happy to confirm it again today&#151;the Government intend to publish a summary of our proposals for elected assemblies prior to any referendums. I have given a commitment that the Government will do their best&#151;will do their damnedest&#151;to publish a draft Bill before the first referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para9"></a>The amendment would require the information to be circulated before the order was made, rather than before the referendums, which substantiates the fact that it is a delaying tactic. We must publish our statement before the 28-day period in which publication of material is restricted, but do so close enough to the referendum so that it is fresh in people's minds. The order can be made many weeks before the referendum, so to publish this or similar information would not be productive for the electorate.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para10"></a>I am going to fall back on the White Paper, on which the Bill is based. This is only the paving Bill. The answer to many of the questions posed in many of the debates during the Bill's passage will be found in the main Bill. However, we will not have the main Bill unless there is a &quot;Yes" vote in a referendum. If potential voters want to know about our proposals sooner, it is Recess reading for the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, of the White Paper. The noble Lord need not be frightened off by the large publication as there is a 12-page summary document. I recommend that it can be read on the Tube on the way home and will give him the most up-to-date information that he can require in order to make a judgment and keep his promise to say nothing else today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, the Tube is far too hazardous a place for me to read such subversive and unclear literature. The White Paper is the sole weapon <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the Minister has waved at us all&#151;and he is waving it at me now. I can assure him that I am totally untempted and unattracted by it.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para11"></a>I will keep my vow of silence if the Minister will answer the simple question which I dared to ask him: whose powers will be given to the assemblies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the short answer is that they will be powers from Ministers and not from local government because the statutory functions of local government are not changing. Yes, Ministers will lose some powers as a result of this. There is no question about that. It would not be possible for the assemblies to have the power to vary among their budget heads unless the powers came from Ministers. It is the only place the powers can come from.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para12"></a>From a statutory point of view, the powers will come from the main Bill. But they will come from Ministers, who will lose powers as a result of the elected regional assemblies. We are happy to do that because we believe in devolving some of the decision making from the centre. It is being taken away from Ministers.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para13"></a>I apologise to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, because I earlier asked colleagues whether he had been sent an Answer to his Question. I was reliably informed that it had been delivered this morning. That is being checked now. I shall not apologise two days running for DEFRA because the situation is quite unacceptable, but I was assured that the Answer was delivered to him this morning. I am hoping that that Answer, or even a copy of it, can be placed in his hands while he is in the Chamber.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para14"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, that the powers will come from Ministers, not from local government.
<P>

<a name="30408-06_para15"></a>I apologise if I did not answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington. He asked about the costs of the review if there is a &quot;No" vote in the referendum. It will be up to individual local authorities to decide how much they want to spend putting evidence to the Boundary Committee. Obviously there is an expenditure there. It will be up to them also whether they are for or against an elected assembly. There is no policy on this; it is up to local authorities. The consequence is that local authorities will make their own decisions on spend and will have to stand by the result of the referendum, whatever that is. Whether they are for or against the referendum, they will put their views to the Boundary Committee in respect of local government changes. We do not intend to underwrite any potentially excessive expenditure by local authorities&#151;
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, surely the Minister is wrong to suggest that it is a voluntary matter for the local authorities. Let us take the case of Cheshire where the county council has stated firmly, as has Lancashire, that it is completely against a referendum. If as a result of the sounding exercise the Secretary of State decides that there will be a referendum and <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore a review, Cheshire will have to service the Boundary Committee and provide it with all the information it requires. It is not a voluntary matter; it is expenditure thrust on the Cheshire County Council as a result of the Minister's decision. Why, therefore, should not the Minister pay if the referendum, which Cheshire never wanted in the first place, resulted in a &quot;No" vote?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030408/text/30408-07.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not know what vote and what debate has taken place in Cheshire County Council to substantiate that. But that is not the point. Local authorities provide evidence and service committees, public inquiries, planning appeals and parliamentary boundary reviews. It is part and parcel of the function of local government. They decide how they want to present their case and they control the costs. It is not a matter that the Government should underwrite.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para0"></a>If there is a &quot;No" vote&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to come back&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, no, let me put my question first. Surely, it is plainly inaccurate to say that the local authority controls the cost. The local authority is obliged to service the Boundary Committee once the Minister has said that there is to be a boundary review. There is nothing voluntary about it. Those costs are incurred directly as a result of the decision of the Secretary of State that there should be a referendum and therefore there has to be a boundary review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is out of order in making a second speech&#151;indeed, a third speech&#151;without asking the leave of the House. This is Report stage. If he has questions to ask the Minister, he must ask them after the Minister has finished. I have checked the Companion and that is the rule.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not know all the rules, but the fact is that I cannot alter the answer. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, does not like the answer, but I cannot give it any other way. The local authorities are in charge of the costs of what they do as regards the boundary review. They decide how strong a case they will make, the costs of the briefs and what they will do in terms of submissions. That is wholly within their control and it is not a matter for the Government.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para1"></a>I hope that this is taken on board because it will happen whatever Minister is around at the time. The Government will issue a statement about the powers and the options for local government reorganisation. This amendment does not provide for everything in any event. The local government options are important but the statement proposed by the amendment would include costs incurred by the Boundary Committee. <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Those costs will be known, but what is the relevance of the costs of the Boundary Committee to whether voters want an elected assembly?
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para2"></a>It may be interesting to have the information, but that factor will not weigh upon whether the voter votes for an elected assembly. The money will have been spent anyway and having the information will not mean that the voter can vote to stop the expenditure. He cannot change the decision. Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, the costs have been incurred and the money spent. I cannot therefore see the relevance of having them.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para3"></a>I would not nit-pick over everything. Not every situation is contained in the amendment and I suspect that by the time the amendment was tabled the Government's proposal to accept the amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, yesterday would not have been known. The menu could therefore have been extended.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para4"></a>I can assure the House that all reasonable information required to allow voters to make an informed, mature choice as to whether they want to vote for an elected regional assembly will be made available. It will be based on the powers and functions of the assembly, its size, consequences of local government reorganisation and so forth. Perhaps not all the necessary consequences of costs will be included, but certainly it will include what will happen to the local government in their area.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para5"></a>Along with what the assembly will do, and its powers, those are the matters that voters will want to know about before they decide whether they want a new structure&#151;a new political animal, if you like. Voters will want us to keep our eye on the ball and address the main issues so that they can make informed choices. They will not want to be driven down the road of decision-making with 20-odd paragraphs detailing what the Boundary Committee may have spent on cups of tea or cakes and biscuits. All that is totally irrelevant and demeans the value of holding a referendum on such an important issue. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will not be pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may thank the Minister for having kicked enough people to enable me to receive the reply that I have been seeking. It has taken since 17th March for the department to regurgitate four paragraphs from the White Paper, which tell me nothing.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para6"></a>However, when it comes to powers, one other paragraph in the reply may interest noble Lords. Discussions have been held with regard to flood defence arrangements. I can tell your Lordships that those powers are not to be transferred to the regional assemblies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, in responding to this amendment the noble Lord said that the one thing the <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government are not doing is starving public services of money. I invite the Minister to talk to headteachers up and down the land.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew8"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-07_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, let me complete my remarks. The Government have talked about a &quot;headline" sum of money exceeding, it is true, the rate of inflation that has been made available to education. What they have not taken into account is the cost of the 1 per cent increase in national insurance contributions, the massive additional sums employers are being forced to contribute to pensions for teachers, the incremental drift that is in place as a result of policies introduced by this Government, and new burdens on local government. None of those costs has been taken into account. I believe that noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches may agree with that point. No doubt they, too, have been hearing from schools right across the country, as I have done. If any more money is to be made available other than to provide a neutral effect to implement these policies, then that would come from public services.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para7"></a>The noble Lord said that the main purpose of the amendment was to introduce delay. If giving information to the people who require it and if giving that information at the outset of the exercise so that they are in a position to understand the nature of the animal for which they are going to have to make sacrifices is regarded as a delaying tactic, then that is his view. As he has done on a number of occasions already, the noble Lord will admit that once it has been determined that a region shall hold a referendum for a regional assembly, the exercise to be undergone will be long, painful and expensive. People need to know for what it is that they are going through all that. If they do not have that information at the beginning of the exercise, then it would be a confidence trick not to give it to them until the point at which they are about to vote.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para8"></a>My noble friends Lord Peyton and Lord Caithness have been extremely patient. They have talked about powers and responsibilities on a number of occasions. I can tell the Minister that we have read and re-read the summary document and every single word of the White Paper. I turn to that document in my effort to seek answers. I do so because the one thing that these documents do not give us are answers to the questions that we have asked relentlessly throughout our debates on the Bill and will continue to ask until it has passed through this House.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para9"></a>I have mentioned previously paragraph 3 of the summary to Chapter 4, which states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XAssemblies will be given a range of powers to help them to deliver these strategies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para10"></a>
We have made the specific point: give examples of actual powers that will be passed down from national government to the regions; powers that are freestanding to do things and to determine them.
<P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para11"></a>However, qualifications are added to that statement. Box 4.1 in Chapter 4 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xskills and employment&#151;which will set out how an assembly and its partners will improve the skills of the workforce and ensure that everybody has access to job opportunities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para12"></a>
That is a function of the county councils, the learning and skills councils, the sector skills councils, the national Learning and Skills Council, the national council for sector skills and some local authorities&#151;not including job centres and so forth. What specific power will the new assembly be given? Will it have the power to second-guess, or perhaps the power to make all those bodies do its bidding? What will be the powers?
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para13"></a>I turn to transport. Box 4.1 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xtransport&#151;which will spell out plans to address congestion, improve public transport and road links, and ensure that the transport system supports sustainable economic growth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para14"></a>
That is a function of the county councils and, where they have the appropriate responsibilities, the unitary authorities. Will the new assemblies second-guess those bodies, will they take powers from them or will they do something else?
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para15"></a>In regard to waste management, Box 4.1 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xwaste&#151;which will set targets and indicators for regional waste management capacity and disposal, including for the recycling and recovery of waste".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para16"></a>
Waste management is a county council and a unitary authority function. It is not a national function; it is a local government function.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para17"></a>I turn now to housing. Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches find this amusing, although they are supposed to care about local government. Box 4.1 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xhousing&#151;which will deal with all aspects of the housing market and social housing in the region".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para18"></a>
That is a function of district councils and, in part, a function of county councils&#151;as well as, of course, unitary authorities where they exist.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para19"></a>My final example is health improvement, on which Box 4.1 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xhealth improvement&#151;setting out a long-term public health strategy, which assemblies will agree with the relevant Regional Directors of Public Health".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-07_para20"></a>
There is already in place a long-term strategy for health matters throughout the regions of the country. What form is the new strategy to take? Furthermore, we have in place the primary care trusts and the regional strategic authorities. What will their functions be if the new regional assemblies are going to second-guess them? What powers will the regional assemblies be given in respect of this area?
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para21"></a>Those voting for this amendment will be voting for information to be made available before an order is made so that, throughout the reorganisation exercise, the nature of the regional assembly, its powers, functions and predicted costs will be made known. <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That guarantee will be put on to the face of the Bill which will require the Deputy Prime Minister and/or his replacement to honour that commitment.
<P>

<a name="30408-07_para22"></a>Those who vote against the amendment will be denying any guarantee that such information will be made available to the people who really matter; the people in the regions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 25:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-08_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;REFERENDUMS EXPENDITURE
<br>
 After paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 14 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) there is inserted&#151; &quot;(2A) In the case of a referendum held under the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 an overall limit shall be placed on the total permitted spending by all permitted participants campaigning for and against the proposition, and that limit shall be equal in respect of each side and subject to a formula by which the overall ceiling is no more than &pound;1 million.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-08_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I return to a matter that we raised earlier in Committee&#151;the restrictions, if any, to be placed on the amount of money that can be spent by or on behalf of candidates during any referendum campaign. I am grateful to the Minister for writing to me following our last discussion on this matter. He answered a number of my questions but I should like to raise one more point that he did not clarify. He has made it clear that the institutions of the European Union can contribute to the referendum campaign. That was one of the matters about which I asked him. However, it is not clear how much will be allocated to participants&#151;that is, the candidates who are standing and the list candidates as well.
<P>

<a name="30408-08_para2"></a>In his letter to me, the Minister said that Section 117 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provides that no individual or body can incur referendum expenses of more than &pound;10,000 during the referendum period unless they are registered as a 'permitted participant'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-08_para3"></a>
I imagine that a &quot;permitted participant" would include a candidate. I am not clear, therefore, about the rationale regarding the money available. I understand that for all other elections, there are various formulae. I have spared the House by not going through the formula for each aspect of elections because I do not think it would be very instructive. What is instructive, however, is that there is a formula. It relates to the amount that the constituency member&#151;that is, a candidate&#151;can spend, which is usually per head, and how much is available to the subsequent list members.
<P>

<a name="30408-08_para4"></a>A very rough calculation of the amount available for the Greater London Assembly elections leads me to the view that that figure was under &pound;1 million. There <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>needs to be an upper limit on expenditure and probably also on total expenditure. I am concerned that companies will be able to put in money without having to appeal to their shareholders.
<P>

<a name="30408-08_para5"></a>If there is to be a formula, does the Minister yet know what it will be? If not, will the noble Lord consider that that expenditure should not be more than &pound;1 million&#151;which is a lot of money in terms of promoting people's futures?
<P>

<a name="30408-08_para6"></a>The Minister told me that he would let me know before Third Reading if he had any further views. I have returned to the point a bit sooner and if he can give any further information, I shall be grateful. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I will give the noble Baroness the latest information and will honour my commitment to come back with more before Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para0"></a>Amendment No. 25 seeks to set the overall limit on the total permitted spending by all participants campaigning for or against elected assemblies. Let us be absolutely clear that we are not here talking about candidates but about campaigns for or against an elected assembly.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para1"></a>The noble Baroness wants a ceiling of &pound;1 million and cited the rough basis for that figure. I shall not quite quibble with it because, from her point of view, there is some logic to it. As my noble friend Lord Evans explained in Committee, that approach is at odds with the one taken by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Schedule 14(2) to that Act allows for an order to be made setting limits on expenditure incurred by individual permitted participants&#151;either by themselves or on their behalf. It envisages that that might be done by setting limits for different categories of permitted participant&#151;as has already been done in respect of UK-wide referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para2"></a>Moreover, my noble friend explained at length that the amendment would result in an unworkable solution in terms of both timing for setting individual limits and enforcement of the limits. I will not repeat those reasons now as they are on record from the Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para3"></a>Schedule 14(2) to the 2000 Act contains a provision to set different limits in relation to referendums held in parts of the UK. My right honourable friend Nick Raynsford, Minister of State with responsibilities for local government, wrote to Sam Younger, chair of the Electoral Commission, seeking its views on whether different limits should apply for regional referendums&#151;and if so, what they should be and why. The commission has not yet undertaken detailed work on appropriate levels for regional referendums but has suggested that its officials work with those of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which we think is a sensible way forward.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para4"></a>We also need to reflect with the commission on how regional referendums should interact with local government referendums. We envisage putting out proposals for public consultation before making any <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order&#151;and Parliament will of course have the opportunity to scrutinise in due course any order made under Schedule 14(2) to the 2000 Act.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para5"></a>I assure your Lordships that we shall look carefully at the whole issue&#151;this is new territory&#151;and seek to work very closely with the Electoral Commission. In light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied. I repeat my commitment to contact her before Third Reading if I have more up-to-date information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful for the Minister's reply and for the correspondence that has ensued through the course of the Bill. The Minister has sought to keep us up to date. Even though my noble friend Lord Caithness was absent, at least there was an intention to keep him informed. We all appreciate that courtesy, so I wanted to place our thanks on record.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para6"></a>I do not propose to pursue the amendment. I want only to leave on record that one aspect of the campaign must not be overwhelmed by another simply because extra money is available from different sources. There must be some way of ensuring equality in giving the right to spend to a certain limit but no further. If the Minister agrees, perhaps he will ensure that aspect is discussed with the Electoral Commission, so that both parties are on a level playing field as far as money is concerned. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </B>   moved Amendment No. 26:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 24, after &quot;section 1" insert &quot;or (Local government referendums)(2) with one another or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-09_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30408-09_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 26, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 28, 34, 58 and 60. These amendments are all consequential on there now being local government referendums. Amendment No. 26 enables the regional referendum poll to be combined with the polls for local government referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para11"></a>Subsection (6) of Amendment No. 12 moved yesterday by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, required that the two referendums must be held on the same date. It makes sense to enable the polls to be combined, to reduce bureaucracy and duplication of effort&#151;which would be the case if the polls had to be run in parallel. Under the amended Clause 6, it would also still be possible to combine these polls with other polls for local or general elections or for local mayoral referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para12"></a>Amendment No. 28 amends Clause 7. It simply ensures that the Electoral Commission can encourage voting in relation to regional referendums and local government referendums. Amendment No. 34 amends Clause 9. It ensures that a Minister of the Crown can make provisions for the payment by the Electoral Commission of charges and expenses in connection with both types of referendum.
<P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para13"></a>Amendment No. 58 amends Clause 28. It ensures that Parliament can provide for any expenditure of a Minister of the Crown in connection with regional referendums and local government referendums. Amendment No. 60 amends the Long Title so that it reflects the holding of referendums about options for implementing the recommendations of local government reviews.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para14"></a>I urge your Lordships to support these sensible tidying amendments. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para15"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </B>   moved Amendment No. 27:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 35, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-09_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30408-09_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 35 and 41. In moving her amendment for a second referendum question, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, explained that her amendment provided for the Secretary of State, by order, to make provision in connection with the holding of the second referendums. She explained that such a power was needed because the options which will be put to voters in two-tier areas will vary from region to region, and because we would need time work out, in each case, the best arrangements for the new local referendums. Nevertheless, before making such an order, it is important that the Electoral Commission should be consulted. Amendment No. 41 provides for this by making suitable provision in Clause 11 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para18"></a>Amendments Nos. 27 and 35 are consequential amendments, which tidy up the Bill, so that the various obligations on the Secretary of State to consult the Electoral Commission are all set out in one place. Noble Lords will recall that such requirements exist in relation to the Secretary of State's order-making powers under Clause 6&#151;XCombination of polls"&#151;and Clause 9&#151;XExpenditure". Amendments Nos. 27 and 35 remove the separate requirements from those clauses and brigade them together in Clause 11. I emphasise, however, that the amendments in no way diminish the obligations on the Secretary of State to consult the Electoral Commission.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para19"></a>I shall move Amendments Nos. 35 and 41 in the appropriate places. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para20"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para21"></a>Clause 7 [Encouraging voting]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker </B>   moved Amendment No. 28:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-09_para22"></a><P>

<a name="30408-09_para23"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 29:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 5, at end insert &quot;provided that anything they undertake to encourage voting does not disproportionately favour one of the possible referendum outcomes to the detriment of the other"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-09_para24"></a><P>

<a name="30408-09_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 29 would provide that nothing the Electoral Commission undertook to encourage voting <P>


<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disproportionately favoured one of the outcomes. The amendment would ensure fairness. As the Minister knows, because we said it previously in the debate and because legal challenges are currently being made, public money is being spent on arguing for a referendum. We know&#151;or, at least, no one has convinced us otherwise&#151;that the few examples of those who are campaigning against referendums are doing so at their own cost.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para26"></a>It is not unreasonable to believe that a similar imbalance may carry on when the Bill becomes law and campaigning and the use of public money becomes legitimate. The amendment would make it clear that the Electoral Commission must be entirely impartial as it encourages voting in the referendum.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para27"></a>There are people in the North East who believe that the playing field is not level. I know that the Minister will say, with every good intention, that there is no intention that anything other than a level playing field should prevail. However, given that people are uncertain and losing confidence, it is important to have a requirement on the Electoral Commission that can be seen to be a legal requirement as well as one of good intent.
<P>

<a name="30408-09_para28"></a>The Electoral Commission is an independent body with a sensitive role; it will not be the first time that it has engaged in such a role. It would be very easy to influence the outcome of the referendum as it works to boost voter turnout. Anything that can be done to boost voter turnout is important, and it is important to make the commission's role in that clear. I have every confidence in the commission and in the Minister, when he tells us of the Government's intentions for it to remain neutral. The amendment provides the legislative back-up to justify its neutrality in this context, giving more confidence to local people in the process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, this is an important amendment. The noble Baroness referred to the fact that, in the North East, there has been a grave suspicion that public money from council tax payers has been used to support one side of the argument.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para0"></a>I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and Mr Raynsford, for reacting positively to suggestions that government money was being used on one side of the argument. They made it absolutely clear that they do not approve of government or taxpayers' money being used on one side of the argument. That is very welcome, but a fear remains that in some parts local authorities are using public money.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para1"></a>Neil Herron, of the metric martyrs association, is taking action against Sunderland Borough Council on the grounds that it has participated in an organisation campaigning for regional assemblies to be established. I well remember that in the Welsh referendum, the money and the opinion expressed in the newspapers was skewed towards the &quot;Yes" campaign, and there were accusations that public authorities had used public money in advance of the referendum and, in some cases, during the referendum.

<a name="30408-10_para2"></a>This is an important amendment, which enables this House to establish that it believes that any referendum should be carried out very fairly, without rate payers' or taxpayers' money being engaged on any one side of the argument. It also gives the Government the opportunity to reiterate that they will not allow, under any circumstances, government money to be used on one side of the argument. I can only hope that, if they have any influence with local authorities, they will prevail on them to take the strong, fair and legal line that the Government themselves are taking.

<A NAME="30408-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was right to draw attention to what is happening in the North East. However, jiggery-pokery is also being practised in the North West. I had occasion earlier to draw attention to a letter addressed by the chief executive of the North West Regional Assembly to Lancashire County Council. The council had told the assembly that it had reason to believe that money that it had given the assembly was being wrongly spent on campaigning. The assembly had the effrontery to write back to the council, admitting that it had passed a resolution, saying,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xwe, the North West Regional Assembly declare our intention to become an elected Regional Government",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-10_para3"></a>
and had immediately afterwards issued a press release saying that it was campaigning,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xfor a referendum in the Region at the earliest opportunity to give people in the North West their say on whether they want directly elected Regional Government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-10_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30408-10_para5"></a>Rather unconvincingly, when it was pointed out to the assembly that if it was so campaigning it would be acting illegally, the assembly tried to go back on what it had said in the press release. That was hardly convincing, given the plain wording of the press release.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para6"></a>Obviously, therefore, we need to be very watchful. We must learn from that unfortunate experience.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, in Committee, when we debated an identical amendment, my noble friend Lord Rooker said that he agreed with the whole thrust of the noble Baroness's case but argued, nevertheless, that her amendment was unnecessary. I believe that the noble Baroness is really looking for reassurance today that the Government agree with the position she has taken. I hope that I shall be able to reassure the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para7"></a>As my noble friend said in Committee, the Electoral Commission is an independent body that takes a fair and responsible approach to all its statutory duties. It should not be seen to favour one outcome of a referendum over another. Under Clause 7, we consider that the commission would have a public law duty to act in a reasonable and balanced way. It could be subject to challenge by way of judicial review if it acted in a biased way. The power is simply to encourage voting; it is not to encourage any particular outcome.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para8"></a>However, Amendment No. 29 might positively encourage the commission to act in a biased way. If the commission has information that one particular result <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in a referendum is more likely than another, is it actively to persuade voting the other way? Indeed, the amendment would seem to imply that the commission can favour one of the possible outcomes of the referendum provided that it acts &quot;proportionately", whatever that means. But crucially&#151;I stress the word &quot;crucially"&#151;Clause 7 should only be about getting people to turn out to vote, not influencing for whom they vote. The commission should, quite rightly, do this in an unbiased way.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para9"></a>I should respond to the interventions made by the noble Lords, Lord Waddington and Lord Stoddart of Swindon. The amendment relates to Clause 7, which is solely about the role of the Electoral Commission. It has nothing to do with the activities of other bodies. During proceedings on the Bill, both in Committee and on Report, we have heard many stories about the activities of the North East and of the North West, but, so far, there is no evidence in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para10"></a>However, I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that the Government would not under any circumstances use money to favour one side over another. I believe that that was the substance of his intervention. With that explanation, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, as always, we shall want to reflect upon the noble Lord's response. I believe that he has given us a good deal of what we wanted by way of these amendments. I thank the noble Lord, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para12"></a>Clause 8 [Provision of information to voters]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker </B>   moved Amendment No. 30:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 7, leave out &quot;This section" and insert &quot;Subsection (2)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-10_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30408-10_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) will apply for the purposes of a referendum on regional assemblies. Consistent with the provisions of that Act, Clause 8 of the Bill is currently drafted to permit the Electoral Commission to step in and ensure that voters have the information they need in order to make an informed choice when they vote about whether they want an elected assembly. It limits the Electoral Commission's role to situations where it has not otherwise appointed &quot;designated organisations" in relation to each possible outcome at the referendum; in other words, where it has not designated yes or no campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para15"></a>With the introduction of the second referendum into local government reorganisation, upon which we agreed yesterday, we need to establish the rules that will apply. The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, permitted the Secretary of State to establish such rules by order. We shall be talking to the Electoral Commission about how these referendums should be run. There are a number of options available.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para16"></a>It is possible that we shall apply some or all of the PPERA rules. Alternatively, as these are local referendums, we might establish something more akin to <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the rules that apply to the mayoral referendums. We might do something different again. We want to discuss such matters with the Electoral Commission. But in advance of establishing those rules, it seems prudent to allow the commission sufficient scope to ensure that voters in each local government referendum have sufficient information to make an informed choice&#151;if, for example, the information would not be made available in other ways. In effect, it is a consequential amendment arising from the decisions made yesterday. Quite clearly, there remains work to be done with the commission as regards finding a satisfactory way forward. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, as we now find ourselves &quot;muddled" on these two referendums, perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on one point. I do not know whether the Minister has had time to think about this, but is it the Government's intention to have two separate questions on two separate ballot papers? If that is the case, they will be separated and people will be able to see that they are voting on two entirely different matters and on a different referendum. Alternatively, is it the intention to introduce this as a second question tied up with the first referendum?
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para17"></a>It is an important point. We have many concerns, but one of the problems with the second question is that there does not seem to be any way of voting against it; in other words, there is no way for someone to say &quot;I don't want this local government reform"&#151;or, indeed, any of it. People will just be asked to choose an option. It should be made clear that these are two separate entities, even though they may be taking place on the same day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer the noble Baroness's question because no decisions have yet been made. However, I shall base my response on past experience. As my noble friend Lord Evans said when moving earlier amendments, essentially we want the referendums to take place on the same day and in the same polling booth. We do not know the degree of the questions or of the options on the local government referendum&#151;at least two choices, possibly more&#151;or, indeed, how they will be set out and deployed in the length of a ballot paper.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para18"></a>As is normal, I suspect that it may involve two separate ballot papers, one being a different colour to the other to make clear that difference. They may be put in the same ballot box and then separated later, or placed in separate boxes. I simply do not know. It may be wholly impractical to put all the information on one paper because we would not know the exact layout of the local government options. This is a matter for consideration. The layout must be clear to voters.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para19"></a>As regards the regional referendum, this will clearly be a case of whether the voter is in favour, or not in favour, of the proposal. With the local government referendum, it follows from the whole thrust and the pattern&#151;does it not?&#151;that there will be two or more options from which to choose. It is up to the elector <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which option, if any, he or she chooses. I cannot envisage how there could conceivably be any other way forward. There will be two or more options, one of which must be chosen if people so wish. Alternatively, they could abstain.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para20"></a>I have just been given some further information. I shall read out the advice in this briefing note, in the knowledge that what I have just said may be completely contradictory. On the question of whether there will be two ballot papers or one, I am advised that either approach is possible. I think I said that. My briefing goes on to say that we are discussing the matter further with the Electoral Commission&#151;good! As for which approach is appropriate, I am advised that that may depend on the number and length of the local government options. Indeed, that is what I just said. Clearly, further work is required on the matter.
<P>

<a name="30408-10_para21"></a>By and large, the answers are self-evident. It depends to a certain extent on the nature of the options for local government; in other words, how many there are in a particular area. They will vary. It is a county-wide, local referendum, which may be different in the same region. Such considerations are a matter for the Electoral Commission. People must be able to understand the information supplied.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the arrangements sound fairly complicated, especially if the options for local government are to be spelt out precisely. For example, in a large region many changes may be made to the boundaries of district as well as county councils. It will not simply be that &quot; is abolished and Y is instituted. Many other changes would need to be understood. First, will those arrangements be approved by an order before Parliament? Will there be an order before Parliament to ascertain whether there will be separate ballot papers and what will be on them? Secondly, will the advice of the Electoral Commission be sought in terms of approving the arrangements?
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para0"></a>Did the Minister really mean that the regional assembly vote is straightforward: that one is either for it or against it? During the previous debate, the noble Lord rightly made this point: that there is a link between whether one wants a regional assembly; and the price for having that regional assembly. There is a link between the two votes; one is linked with the other. The answer to a regional assembly vote could be &quot;Yes" because one of the options is satisfactory, or &quot;No" because the arrangements are not satisfactory. Simply being for or against a regional assembly is not entirely without complication. There is a link with the other question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, we have the advantage of the first question in the Bill. That is a straightforward &quot;Yes" or &quot;No". The consequences will now be made clearer because of the second referendum. The alternative originally was to have a &quot;Yes" or &quot;No" and, in publications produced by the Government and others, to spell out that the consequences of having an elected regional assembly is single tier local government. In order to give a greater choice of options for the form of single tier local government, the situation is necessarily more complex.
<P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para1"></a>The noble Baroness asks whether there will be an order. As we discussed yesterday, the order will be subject to the affirmative resolution including the text of the options to appear on the ballot paper and any extra information such as maps. The Electoral Commission's views will be sought and put before the House with the order. All these matters will come back to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para2"></a>In order to make a rod for my own back I shall give an example. I had it ready to use yesterday but there was not a suitable time. I believe that it would be useful to have it on the record. I want to be as open as possible. I asked for an example of a region where there were some complicated options&#151;perhaps across a county boundary. I have chosen a region where I understand that the chamber has specifically requested not to be part of the first tranche. Whatever the soundings&#151;I do not know what they are&#151;the regional chamber of the West Midlands has said that it does not want a referendum; it does not want to be in the first tranche. I do not wish to refer to the two areas which we have always debated because I have to give examples of how the local structure might be joined together and it might mislead.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para3"></a>I hope that the example I give will help. Noble Lords may chastise me, saying that it was not helpful and it would have been better not to have known about it. The example is purely hypothetical. It does not mean that the West Midlands will be among the first regions to hold a referendum. I have stated that the chamber has asked that it should not be. Nor shall I say anything about the unitary structure of the West Midlands. That would be a matter for the Boundary Committee if it were asked to do a review of local government.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para4"></a>Let us suppose that following a review there is a set of recommendations for Worcestershire; that is, the area currently comprising of the district councils of Malvern Hills, Worcester, Wychavon, Wyre Forest, Bromsgrove and Redditch. The recommendations involve two options: the first for a single unitary authority based on the current county boundary; the second for two unitary authorities, one comprising the current districts of Malvern Hills, Worcester and Wychavon and another comprising the districts of Wyre Forest, Bromsgrove and Redditch. In this case, Worcestershire would be treated as the county area and voters in that area would vote for which of the two options they preferred. In similar circumstances, there would be separate votes also in Warwickshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, the other county council areas of the West Midlands. I simply take the county of Worcestershire as an option.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para5"></a>Let us look at an alternative scenario in which two options are on the table&#151;a single county unitary for Worcestershire and a two-unitary solution&#151;but where the two-unitary solution included the creation of an authority which crossed the county line and took in part or all of the area of the district of Stratford-on-Avon which is currently part of Warwickshire. There would also be other options on the table for Warwickshire in order to take account of that. The county area in this case would be the combined areas of Worcestershire <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Warwickshire and the referendum would be held on a combined basis in the two counties to see which option people favoured.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para6"></a>That is an example where the Boundary Committee may put forward an option which crosses a county boundary in the same region. We are not talking about regional boundaries. The option would be in the two-county area as opposed to the single county area and would be accompanied by maps and visuals. I hope that that is helpful to the House. It is intended to be so.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House and before the noble Lord sits down, I found worrying one remark by the Minister. He said that he cited the region because the regional chambers had said that they did not wish to be in the first tranche. He said also that that does not mean that it will not be in the first tranche&#151;so it was not a good reason. That singles out the region in a worrying way. Had other regions known that, they may have been wise enough to have said, &quot;We don't want to be in the first tranche either".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness reads far too much into it. I asked officials yesterday morning for an example which would flesh out how the system would work. I asked specifically not to be given an example from the north-west or north-east region because we would have to give hypothetical details about which district might join with which in two areas which have been debated constantly since Second Reading. I asked for an area on which there has been no debate. As far as I know, there has been no hypothetical issues with regard to the West Midlands. Yorkshire and Humberside have been mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para7"></a>I read in the Birmingham Post&#151;I have had no correspondence with the chamber&#151;that it had said, &quot;We do not want to be part of the first tranche". It is a matter for the Deputy Prime Minister whether he follows that judgment depending on the soundings. I have no knowledge of the soundings. It is no good giving an example of invented names from a county which does not exist. One has to give examples of real places in order to explain how the system may work in one circumstance or another. I fail to see how one could give examples of other than real places. The example is purely hypothetical. It is based on an ad hoc arrangement. The Boundary Committee could put forward an entirely different arrangement. That is up to the Boundary Committee, not me or my officials.
<P>

<a name="30408-11_para8"></a>I asked for an example of a scenario where the county line might be crossed. The county area has to be defined. It is a county council if it is within the one county. However, the Boundary Committee has flexibility to make sensible arrangements for single tier local government. It may say that in certain areas it is a good idea to cross a county boundary. What would be the consequences of that for people having a referendum on the local government issue? Please do <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not read too much into it. It is too late to start campaigning or writing to all the regional chambers. That is not why I gave the example.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall not read too much into it. The noble Lord has been extremely helpful. However, my noble friend Lady Seccombe may be put out by the remark that there was no mention of the West Midlands. My noble friend mentioned it in some detail in her Second Reading speech as did other noble Lords.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para5"></a>
and so on, I took it to mean that no court should entertain any proceedings. That is what the words say and that is what I believed they meant. I then turned to the Explanatory Notes to see whether I had misunderstood the position. One argument put <P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forward in support of the provision, which I have never believed is a valid argument in this Chamber, was simply that it has been done before. Reference was made to the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Act, but the Act that is truly pertinent to the debate was passed 28 years ago. The Minister has quite openly agreed that this Bill addresses a unique provision. I should therefore like to consider my Amendments Nos. 37 and 39 in that light and on their merits.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para6"></a>If the Bill&#151;in a free-standing clause which does not refer to any other clause&#151;states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings for questioning the . . .  ballot",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para7"></a>
I shall take it to mean just that. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, at col. 559, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the clause does not rule out any and every challenge to a referendum result being looked at by the courts".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para8"></a>
But as the Bill states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para9"></a>
it does rule out any challenge regardless of whether it is minor or major. The noble Lord, at col. 560, went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The clause is certainly designed to cut out less serious challenges".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para10"></a>
Not only does that contradict the noble Lord's first statement, but there is no reference to either serious or less serious offences being brought before the court. Indeed, as I keep repeating, the Bill states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30408-12_para12"></a>The noble Lord went on to say that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an alleged serious error could be challenged in the courts",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para13"></a>
but he could not give an example. How can it be challenged in the courts if no court will entertain the proceedings? He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Court challenges take time. Undue delay could result in difficulties as regards introducing the main Bill to set up the assemblies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para14"></a>
If a wrong has been done and a remedy has to be sought in court, that wrong must be remedied regardless of whether it delays this or any other Bill. It is not an argument to say that a court challenge should not be allowed because it might delay this Bill or the later assemblies Bill.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para15"></a>The noble Lord went on to repeat:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recognise that the clause may not prevent all challenges, particularly those of a serious nature".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para16"></a>
Again I say that that cannot be the case.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para17"></a>The noble Lord also said that my Amendment No. 72 in Committee was a &quot;little dodgy" because it imposed a rather short time scale. I have taken him at his word and extended it to three months, which I think is probably more reasonable. I think that it would be wrong to make the time scale any longer as it could allow for very much delayed vexatious challenges. Neither the Minister nor we would want that.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para18"></a>The noble Lord, at col. 561, went on to say that he hoped that,

However, as the provision states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para20"></a>
serious or otherwise, I do not believe that that is the case. As long as those words remain in the Bill, I think that there will have to be a very good explanation as to why we should accept what the Minister has been advised.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para21"></a>The noble Lord, at col. 563, went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Therefore, some case law does exist but no ouster clause of this kind has ever been considered by the courts, and that is a problem".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para22"></a>
We had a debate about the ouster clause, but I still do not believe that it impacts on how we approach Clause 10. In the middle of the night when we were discussing this amendment in Committee, when he had finished his duties as the Deputy Chairman of Committees, my noble friend Lord Elton leapt to his feet to resume his place on these Benches. He admitted to me that he had never before sat through such a confusing and extraordinary debate. When able to speak in the debate, at col. 564, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have been longing to join in this debate. If the words in the Bill do not mean what they say, surely words should be found that mean what the Government intend. Could we have words that say what the Government intend so that people like the noble Lord and myself, who are not lawyers, can understand what they mean so that we do not have to pay vast sums of money to lawyers to tell us what they mean?".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para23"></a><P>

<a name="30408-12_para24"></a>In winding up on the amendment, I said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The public will have to make sense of what it means".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para25"></a>
We in this place are part of the Westminster village. We are accustomed and privy to legalese on a daily basis. However, it is the public who will have to understand what the Bill means. As I said then:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If at the end of the day we say, 'Do not worry about reading the words on the page, the Minister says that they mean something else and when it says that no court shall entertain any proceedings, do not believe that because they will entertain some proceedings as long as the proceedings are serious because that is what the lawyers advise'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-12_para26"></a><P>

<a name="30408-12_para27"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who had almost but not quite the last word on that amendment. She said:

<a name="30408-12_para28"></a>
I have read the debate. I still think that my amendments are worthy of consideration. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I have the gravest doubts as to whether the wording of Clause 10 could exclude proceedings for fraud. However, the fact remains that Amendment No. 37 can do no harm. Certainly it would make the matter a lot clearer. I cannot see how it could do any harm. I therefore urge the Minister to accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the point is indeed serious. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has said that the Government will come back with an amendment to the clause, I think that it would be more useful to consider what the Government are working on. I have one observation to which the Minister need not <P>


<a name="column_166"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reply. Given that the role of the courts which cannot be ousted is that of judicial review, and given that the period for applying for a judicial review is, I believe, six weeks rather than three months&#151;which is the period mentioned in Amendment No. 39&#151;I should like to know how the provision fits within the context of the overall law of judicial review. One has to be extremely careful about the unforeseen consequences of this type of provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the initial remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Yesterday&#151;when I was criticised by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, for even raising the issue of Clause 10 in relation to Clause 5, although I was at the time speaking to Amendments Nos. 38 and 40, I think&#151;I made a firm commitment that we would come back at Third Reading with government amendments to Clause 10. That said, I hope that we do not need to prolong the issue. I am not a lawyer and therefore I must operate on the best advice I am given. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is absolutely right: at present there is no evidence that the courts could be ousted from considering, say, a fraud case concerning, for example, a returning officer.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para29"></a>It appears that Clause 10 imposes a blanket ban but it does not. That is what I am told. In this type of situation we non-lawyers find out how lawyers make their money. We are dealing with something that appears to be absolutely straightforward with no qualification whatever. It looks like a blanket ban but we are told that it is not. There are circumstances in which the courts would hold the right to look into something.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para30"></a>Therefore, we shall return at Third Reading with an amendment which not only relates to fraud but focuses on issues such as the type of legal challenges that can be made, the type of court that would have jurisdiction and possibly a time limit in bringing proceedings. There are a number of options, including something along the lines suggested by the noble Baroness in relation to the timing of legal challenges. But we need to consider the matter very carefully because Third Reading will be our last opportunity to get it right.

<A NAME="30408-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, and in the light of what he has just said, will he be able to ensure that the amendments that he might propose are available in time for other people to take some advice and, if necessary&#151;if they believe it desirable&#151;to table amendments to his amendments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords. As someone said yesterday, when a Bill is published, there are notes on the clauses. However, I regret that when the Government or others come along with substantial amendments which the Government accept, the Explanatory Notes for those amendments are not necessarily available. In this case, I shall not be able to stand here at Third Reading with amendments to Clause 10 unless I or the Government <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>have been able to publish an English translation with legal footnotes and back-up explaining exactly what those changes mean.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para31"></a>Frankly, if I am not up to the task, I shall plead with my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General to come along to help out. I hope that, if I can obtain an English translation explaining what we are trying to achieve with the necessary precedents, I shall be able to cope and give people comfort. However, I shall not return with amendments unless a satisfactory explanation has been given in advance. By definition, that explanation must allow for the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart.
<P>

<a name="30408-12_para32"></a>I do not have any idea of the timetable, although I have a vague idea in my mind about the date of Third Reading. I thought that it would be on 28th April in order to meet the requirement for Royal Assent to be given on 8th May, as I was told by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. But there is sufficient time. I know that the recess is in the way but, if there is time to dream up the amendments, there is time to dream up a translation that we non-lawyers can understand.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the so-called &quot;information" that I had, I am sorry that the noble Lord does not receive such information from his own party. It seems that his party gave us the information before giving it to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para0"></a>I consider the Minister to be more than equal to the task of taking the Bill through the House. I have the utmost admiration for the feisty way that he has done so and for the fact that he has been courteous and incredibly patient with some of us who have been more than a thorn in his side throughout the proceedings. But that is the stuff of politics, and the strength of this House lies in the way that we operate.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para1"></a>However, one thing surprises me. With the benefit of parliamentary counsel, which is considerable, and with the benefit of officials who take away the Committee stage of a Bill, consider all the pros and cons that have been argued and return with a reasoned, properly explained note, it should not be necessary to engage the Attorney-General, who has a million other things with which to concern himself&#151;not least the Iraq war&#151;to deal with this one amendment. The advisers in the department should have an answer to this question.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para2"></a>Perhaps I may give a parallel example. If a parent received a notice that no appeal would be entertained for questioning a grievance about a pupil in school, the parent could be forgiven for believing that that would deny him an appeal against the grievance about his child. A serious case would be considered but not a minor or vexatious case. That cannot be the explanation for Clause 10. As I said, the clause is free-standing. There is no reference to schedules, and there is no link to any other clause in the Bill. It simply states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings for questioning the . . .  ballot".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-13_para3"></a>
It will have to be a very good explanation indeed.
<P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para4"></a>Frankly, from what the noble Lord said, I consider the clause to be otiose. I believe that it is redundant, that it could come out of the Bill and that whatever is on the statute book could prevail. The amendment that the noble Lord will bring back at Third Reading might take that into account. But if an amendment is tabled to the clause and if the clause remains part of the Bill, I shall take it as read that it will at least achieve the purpose and aim of my amendments. If that is not the case, I shall be very worried.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para5"></a>I listened to yesterday's debate but was not sure whether the amendments were intended to comfort my concerns about Clause 10 or to comfort the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I had intended to press the amendments but I shall not do so today because I believe it is important to give the Minister an opportunity to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para6"></a>So far as I am concerned, at present the Plain English Campaign, myself and others who read the clause&#151;especially those who are not used to legalese&#151;will have no doubt in reading what is actually plain English:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No court shall entertain any proceedings for questioning the number of ballot".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-13_para7"></a>
Therefore, in eager anticipation of Third Reading, which I believe is to take place on the 28th&#151;at least, that is the date which I have been asked to put in my diary and which has rather scuppered my holiday&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 43:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 42, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-13_para19"></a><P>

<a name="30408-13_para20"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 43, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 44. Amendment No. 43 would eliminate a redundant subsection from the Bill. In effect, the clause in question enables the Secretary of State to prepare to direct the Boundary Committee to review local government in a given region before the ink has even dried on the statute book&#151;indeed, I think that it probably already has done. It gives the Secretary of State power to consider views, information and evidence about the level of interest in a given region in holding a referendum. It also enables the Secretary of State to consider a number of factors that might influence which region or regions he directs the Boundary Committee to review. Therefore, it is a question of leaving out subsection (7).
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para21"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 44, if noble Lords cast their eyes over Part 3 of the Bill, they will see that the whole of Clause 20 is devoted to the way that the Electoral Commission will be required to prepare and submit its advice. We on this side of the House see no reason why the transparent process that the Bill requires the Electoral Commission to follow is not applied to the work of the Boundary Committee.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para22"></a>As the Bill stands, a direction to the Boundary Committee will simply specify the date by which a review of local government structure will begin in a given region and the date by which the Boundary Committee will have to make its recommendations. The Bill states that a direction may require the Boundary Committee to start and finish its work by certain dates. Such wording implies that even this sparse information may, if the Secretary of State so chooses, be omitted from any direction he gives the Boundary Committee.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para23"></a>The amendment simply seeks to ensure that the review process is open and transparent. It lays down a set of steps that must be included in any direction to the Boundary Committee. Those steps provide a safeguard for people living in areas in which local government reviews will be carried out. They ensure that people are aware of the Boundary Committee's remit; the timescale to which it will operate; and the consultation opportunities that they will have to take part in the review process.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para24"></a>Local government reorganisation is likely to have more of a direct impact on people's lives than decisions about the electoral areas in which they live. There is no doubt that plans to abolish county and district councils, many of which have long histories of serving their local communities, will cause significant and prolonged disruption to the delivery of vital public services&#151;a matter to which we again return.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para25"></a>That disruption will start from the moment that local government reviews are announced. The uncertainty that such reviews inevitably breed will deliver a blow to the morale of the councils affected and will distract councillors and officers from the essential task of delivering efficient, effective public service.
<P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para26"></a>To minimise that uncertainty, there needs to be a clause that maps out the review process from start to finish. By their nature, reviews are lengthy and complex, but the longer they drag on, the more levels of uncertainty arise. The amendment would simply ensure that the Boundary Committee's work was open to public involvement and scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para27"></a>We believe that the Boundary Committee would welcome any attempt to increase public participation in its work. Local people have an inherent understanding of their local communities and are best placed to inform the Boundary Committee's recommendations to the Government. I therefore hope that your Lordships will endorse my arguments by supporting the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 43 seeks to delete Clause 12(7). It would mean that the Secretary of State could not do anything in connection with his consideration of the level of interest or of the factors set out in Clause 12(5)&#151;such as the implications of carrying out a review in two or more regions at the same time&#151;until the Bill had received Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para28"></a>We want to enable regions that want a referendum to be able to hold one as soon as possible. Conducting the soundings exercise on level of interest while the Bill is before Parliament minimises delay in the process. Debate on the Bill in Parliament has also raised publicity for the proposals, which we hope will encourage people to send us their views. The amendment is clearly intended to undo all the work undertaken for the soundings exercise that we initiated last year.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para29"></a>The approach taken in subsection (7) is well precedented&#151;for example, by Section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000. We are not prejudging Parliament. No decisions on the region or regions to go ahead will be taken until the Bill has received Royal Assent. I do not think that I must make the case for having started the soundings exercise, because we have done so repeatedly throughout our debates.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para30"></a>From previous debate, your Lordships will know in respect of Amendment No. 44&#151;a proposed new clause, in effect&#151;that we entirely agree with the sentiments behind it and that in fact, by importing the requirements of the Local Government Act 1992 into this Bill by means of Clause 14, we have ensured that the Boundary Committee will consult widely and that local people will have an opportunity to comment on the process and the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para31"></a>The consultation requirements with which the Boundary Committee will have to comply are set out in Section 15 of the Local Government Act 1992. I assure noble Lords that they are the same requirements as were applied to the structural reviews of the 1990s and that will apply to other structural and boundary reviews carried out by the Electoral Commission in future.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para32"></a>So the Boundary Committee will be required to take steps to inform all interested parties about its draft and final recommendations and of the period within which <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they can make representations. It must already deposit copies of recommendations at the principal office of any principal council. If the South West were to be reviewed, the Secretary of State would expect to ensure that suitable steps were taken to provide for copies to be deposited at the office of the Council of the Isles of Scilly. In practice, all past reviews have published full reports and the Boundary Committee would doubtless do the same.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para33"></a>Noble Lords suggested that those requirements should be in the Bill, but it is not our practice to repeat provision for the same procedures and arrangements in new legislation when those procedures are already set out in statute&#151;not least so as to avoid confusion. I thought that we all agreed early on that we should not write the same thing into a Bill twice. If it is contained in another Act, refer to it, do not repeat it. Otherwise, the risk of confusion is too great.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para34"></a>I therefore hope that noble Lords will accept that to have repeated all the relevant parts of the 1992 Act would have added greatly to the number of clauses in the Bill to no advantage whatsoever. To repeat these provisions would suggest that we should repeat them all. That would be nonsense. However, the spirit is included in the legislation that is on the statute book. I therefore hope that the amendments will not be pressed.

<A NAME="30408-13_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister's response, especially to Amendment No. 44. However, it does make me think that all of our discussion would be remarkably helped if there were an idiots' guide somewhere that mentioned which other Acts of Parliament could be applicable. In Bills, there is only a flat statement, which we must then unpick before we discover that provision can be found in other legislation. I do not know how many Acts there have been concerning local government reviews and local government boundaries&#151;I have not bothered to count them&#151;but there are many. As we have already discussed, other Acts are involved, such as the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="30408-13_para35"></a>I must accept, because I have not checked, that what the Minister said is correct&#151;that that is what would be implemented, that that is what is written into subsection (8)(a) and (b). I never disbelieve the Minister; I assume that that is what is said; and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>referendum on local government reorganisation. I hope that it will not be necessary to labour that point, although I shall do so if required.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para2"></a>Amendment No. 46 signifies a change of policy. I owe the noble Earl, Lord Caithness an apology&#151;I intended to give it to him last night, but the opportunity did not arise. During the course of an exchange yesterday, he asked me about existing unitary authorities having their boundaries changed, when we had clearly said that that was a no-go area. As I was answering him, I thought that the answer that I was giving him could not be right, because of the implications of the second referendum. I did not have an opportunity to refer to my note, which reminded me that I had said something wrong, because we had changed policy.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para3"></a>Amendment No. 46 represents that change of policy. It significantly changes the policy with which we started, because it changes the basis on which any review is conducted. That responds directly to the concern raised by the noble Earl and others&#151;in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. The Boundary Committee should be allowed to consider the boundaries of existing unitary authorities. Although the Government remain concerned to limit the impact of reviews and continue to believe that there is no general need to review the boundaries of unitary authorities, we are prepared to concede that there may be circumstances in which that makes sense. Indeed, in Committee, we were given an example in which there appeared to be a consensus.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para4"></a>Amendment No. 46 therefore allows the Boundary Committee to consider unitary boundaries with a view to expanding them to take in part of a two-tier area. We propose to amend the guidance that we intend to issue to make it clear to the Boundary Committee that we would expect it to exercise that discretion only when there were pressing reasons to look at unitary boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para5"></a>We do not intend this relaxation in the parameters of the review to degenerate into a free-for-all, in which every unitary authority bids to expand its boundaries. I shall not name any of them, but there are some close to home. Therefore we want the Boundary Committee to be satisfied that both the unitary authority and the adjoining two-tier authorities are persuaded of the need to adjust the boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 45 and 48 provide for the necessary changes to ensure that the Government are in a position to allow voters at a second referendum to vote on different options for unitary local government. It provides that instead of a simple coming forward with recommendations for the best unitary structure, the Boundary Committee must make recommendations for at least two options in relation to each county area. It will assess the options against the same criteria as it would otherwise have used, and which are provided for in Clause 13(8). It is most important, therefore, that all the options presented in its recommendations must have regard to the interests and identities of local communities and the need to secure effective and convenient local government.

<a name="30408-14_para7"></a>Amendment No. 48, alongside the amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, establishes a transparent process by which the Secretary of State will proceed once he has received the committee's recommendations. He will have to allow six weeks before laying an order for the second referendum. During that period, he will be receptive to representations as he makes up his mind about the proposals that he will put to voters. Where necessary, he may direct the Boundary Committee to provide him with additional information or advice. He will also be able to reject any of the options and direct the committee either to make different recommendations, or to carry out a further review. If he does so, he will have to wait a further six weeks after receiving any new recommendations before he can make a referendum order.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para8"></a>He will decide which of the committee's recommendations he is going to put to the voters before he makes an order and, in the light of any representations received, whether to modify those recommendations. He will then make an order setting out the options in the form of a question to the voters and seek the Electoral Commission's views on the intelligibility of the question and on the supporting material, as I explained previously in the debate on Amendment No. 17.

<a name="30408-14_para18"></a><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-14_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment refers to the first referendum question: should there be an elected regional assembly for such and such a region? We have been concerned throughout this Bill that the county and district areas might be overwhelmed in a referendum on a regional government. The disparity between the numbers in the counties and districts against those in the large metropolitan areas might mean that even if they voted 100 per cent no, it could have no effect on what would be their own future and their being subjected to a local government review. Those would be the areas where it was carried out. It is not about whether they have a review, or what sort of local government they want. It is on the question of whether they believe that they want regional government at all.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para20"></a>This amendment would ensure that where a referendum took place the returning officer had to ensure that in the vote there was a majority of those voting in the county and the district areas in favour of regional government before he could declare that referendum a success&#151;if other parts of the region voted in favour. It is a simple amendment, but it is not simple in its aim. It seeks to make sure that those county and country areas are not engulfed by the metropolitan areas. We have looked during this Bill at some of the disparities of numbers that are apparent in the White Paper. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I attach the greatest importance to this amendment. I referred earlier to a letter written by the chief executive of the North West Regional Assembly to the clerk to Lancashire County Council. In that letter, dated 17th March, the chief executive said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XLancashire County Council will be aware of the high level of public interest in the North West region, with regard to a referendum on elected regional government."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-14_para21"></a>
The chief executive certainly does not lack effrontery, because when he wrote that letter, he must have known that Lancashire County Council had issued a statement saying that all parties on the council were against a referendum on regional government.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para22"></a>That letter and the remarks of the chief executive highlight the absurdity of the present situation. There is a real risk of the Secretary of State resolving that there should be a referendum in the North West, although Lancashire and Cheshire are against it and Cumbria is at the best ambivalent. That is happening simply because noises in favour are emanating from the North West Regional Assembly, reflecting some support in the Merseyside and Manchester conurbations. There is real <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>risk of a referendum resulting in a yes vote in favour of a regional assembly, simply because of the overwhelming voting power coming from the conurbations of Merseyside and Manchester, and in spite of the fact that the people in Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria have voted almost overwhelmingly against.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para23"></a>Why should the people of those counties be saddled with a regional assembly in the North West because of a big vote in favour in the conurbations but minimal support throughout the rest of the region? It would be a travesty of justice, and a travesty of democracy if the council tax payers of Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria were saddled with the cost of this completely pointless elected assembly and had to pay the salaries of members of an assembly who we now know would have precisely nothing worthwhile to do. No doubt they would find work, because work is always found for idle hands. No doubt they would find some justification for their existence. It would be a travesty of justice and democracy if the people of Lancashire had to pay for that frolic. I commend the amendment to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, &quot;each" in this context is a synonym for &quot;every". It seems that that is not being denied. I wanted to be clear about that in case I was going down the wrong road. If I am right, as I appear to be, any one district or county area would have a veto on the decision of the whole region. The amendment suggests that there should not be a regional referendum, but referendums in each district&#151;and each county area, although I do not think that would be necessary, because there would be results from the districts anyway.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para24"></a>That is nothing like any way in which we have ever voted before and I do not think that it is how we should go about it. Under these proposals, if any single small part of Wales or Scotland or a London borough had voted against the new constitutional arrangements, they would not have happened. It might be quite hard to elect MPs under such a system. If one ward voted against, what would happen to the MP? I shall not go down that route, because it is not quite equivalent.
<P>

<a name="30408-14_para25"></a>Making such a provision for referendums goes to the root of what regional referendums are about in a way that we cannot accept. It would mean that there would not be a regional referendum.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, is she opposing the amendment on the ground that a small, insignificant district area could hold the whole region to ransom simply by not having a majority in favour, or would her argument still apply if any part of a region, however large&#151;for example, a county area, or perhaps across two county areas&#151;was against? Is the noble Baroness arguing against the idea in principle, or is her argument based on one small, insignificant district council area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am arguing against the idea as a matter of principle, large or small. Of course, if the large areas vote against, that will have an impact <P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the outcome of the whole referendum. On a similar&#151;though not identical&#151;amendment in Committee, the Minister said that if there was a tiny majority, the Secretary of State would think very hard about whether to proceed with setting up a regional assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I support what my noble friend said. It is a great pity that the specific argument of a small district council area within a region was used to oppose the amendment when the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is in fact against the amendment in principle. What she said about larger areas, such as a whole county area, is simply not true. As my noble friend Lord Waddington made absolutely clear, if the whole of Northumberland, the whole of Cumbria or even the whole of Lancashire and Cheshire together voted against a regional assembly, they could still be outvoted by the metropolitan urban areas.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para0"></a>The fact that we now have two-tier questions on the ballot paper&#151;one about regional assemblies and the other about the particular shape of the single-tier authorities below the regional assemblies&#151;makes no difference. Everybody is going to answer the regional assemblies question, so if all those in a two-district area in some of the region voted against any option in the regional assemblies or even did not fill in the ballot paper but voted against the regional assembly, they could still be outnumbered by the others. That does not remove the risk of being outvoted by the urban areas. One has only to think of places such as Greater Manchester, Newcastle or&#151;if we may be allowed to use the West Midlands again&#151;some of the more densely populated areas there. We know that the largest area has over 8 million people in it. If all the country areas in that region voted against an assembly and all the densely populated areas voted for it, the country areas would lose. The noble Lord is going to say that we should not pre-empt how people are going to vote. We do not know until they have cast their vote. However, a small percentage of urban voters can outnumber a high percentage of rural voters. Even if turnout in the rural areas is very good and turnout in the urban areas is very poor, there could still be an overwhelming majority of urban voters outvoting and overwhelming the rural voters.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para1"></a>I am sorry again that the county and rural areas are not being supported by the Government or the Liberal Democrats, but we shall continue to do that. I support my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I hope that Hansard will make it clear that I deployed a number of arguments in support of our position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, there may very well be a case for some rural weighting, but I am not sure that the amendment would achieve a fair balance. If the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, really believes that urban dwellers are any more in favour of regional government than those in rural areas, I think he is making a big mistake. People in urban areas are <P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>just as concerned about the imposition of yet another tier of government, which they will have to pay for and from which they will get no benefit.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para2"></a>I do not know how to achieve rural weighting. There are circumstances in which there should be rural weighting, but I do not believe that one area should be able to veto the whole decision.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para3"></a>I am an urbanite and I know that people living in our towns and cities no more welcome the Bill than do people out in the counties and the districts. I would probably not support the amendment. I am so diametrically opposed to and hateful of the Bill that I have been prepared to support Opposition amendments all the way along, but I am very hesitant on this one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not know what would happen if there were a Division on the amendment. My noble friend did not say that he would come and support me.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para4"></a>Throughout our debates, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, has spoken with great confidence and certainty about the views of the electorate in Lancashire and Cheshire. I am not sure there have been any local votes there on the issue yet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, both Lancashire and Cheshire County Councils have issued statements saying that all parties are against a referendum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I also said earlier that I was not aware&#151;and please do not send me any paperwork on it&#151;of councils having had any resolutions, debates or votes on the issue. A statement issued by the party leaders is very different from having a genuine debate after mature consideration of what is in the Bill, although I know it is not enough.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para5"></a>All along I have sought not to overplay the elected regional assemblies. I do not want to underplay them. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is definitely a two nation Tory. There is no doubt about that. She sees the two nation split as urban and rural. She cannot conceive of anyone in Manchester asking what is in the proposals for Manchester. She automatically assumes that urban means you go for it because you get control. That is the kind of language that we have tried to get rid of. We are trying to build one nation. That is why we want a regional referendum, not one carried out on a district basis, setting off one part against another. That is the theme throughout all the noble Baroness's speeches, which I regret, because I do not think society is like that.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para6"></a>This is a bit of a nit-picking point, but the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about it at the start of her speech so that she could be clear about the words. Technically, under the amendment there would have to be a majority in each district and county area, including those districts that are already unitary. Somehow, I do not think that is what the noble Baroness intends. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, made a similar proposal in Committee. I spoke at length then, and it would probably not be best to have another debate on thresholds, so I shall cover generally only the main points.
<P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para7"></a>We believe that the fairest and simplest measure of the referendum result is the votes cast across the region. We have debated the boundaries, the shape of the regions, their differences and the soundings. We followed that precedent in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. We do not think that it would be fair if people who did not vote could effectively veto a &quot;Yes" vote by those who did.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para8"></a>Secondly, it is wrong that the desires of those who vote should be thwarted by those who, for whatever reason, do not bother. The thresholds give an additional, perverse incentive for those opposed to the proposal to stay at home.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para9"></a>Thirdly, we must all encourage as many people as possible to vote. I know that it is difficult. People can get switched off; they can be asked to vote too often; they can argue that they do not understand, but in a democracy we have a job to alert people to the fact that their views count in this case. They count even more than they did at the beginning of the Bill, following the strengthening that we did yesterday.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para10"></a>Clause 7 enables the Electoral Commission to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"do anything they think necessary or expedient for the purpose of encouraging voting at referendums".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-15_para11"></a>
They may encourage voting, not the decision. We dealt with some of the issues relating to that in Committee.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para12"></a>Yesterday we debated the amendments of the noble Baroness opposite, which will give local people a choice on the structure of unitary local government in their two-tier areas. It is true that one follows the other&#151;we have not hidden that. Elected regional assemblies mean single-tier local government. People now have a choice about the shape and structure of the single-tier authority and its components. The Government supported that amendment, which is now part of the Bill. It will be welcomed by people living in England's districts and counties.
<P>

<a name="30408-15_para13"></a>This is not an urban versus rural issue, however much the noble Baroness tries to stir it up to make it so. She can keep goading the Liberal Democrats, with whom her party has obviously fallen out of love during the passage of the Bill, all she likes. The noble Baroness nods. I should not have said that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-15_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No, my Lords, the noble Lord should not have said that. With the leave of the House, does the noble Lord agree with me that the very urban areas that we discussed such as Greater Manchester and other unitary authorities have nothing to lose and nothing to gain in this debate? There will simply be another tier above them. The noble Lord says that rural areas have nothing to lose. But, whichever way rural areas vote, if there is a vote for a regional assembly, which may or may not be enhanced by the density of voting in urban areas, they stand to lose at least one or more of their district councils and all their county councils. Am I right in saying that, whatever happens, they will lose some of what they regard as their local government?

<A NAME="30408-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the assumption is that everybody thinks that everything is perfect. I spent part <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of yesterday listening to teenagers talk about life in rural areas for people of their age, including jobs, education, housing, and the problems of being denied opportunities to start businesses. They were generally having a good moan to the powers that be here in London at a meeting of the rural forum in one of the departments. If everything were perfect in rural areas, I would not have heard everything that I did yesterday in the queries and good positive suggestions made. We should not be against change in the principled way that the noble Baroness is. She wants everything set as if the chocolate-box image of the countryside existed. Life in those areas is not like the image that the noble Baroness presents. Therefore, within the context of the changes to the regional pattern of the country and the devolution of power from Government, we are giving an opportunity for people to have a greater voice.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para0"></a>The constant theme has been the counties. The two northern counties have been mentioned constantly, with reference to Manchester and Newcastle. Of the eight regions outside London, four have a majority in two-tier areas and four have a majority in unitary areas&#151;it is split. But the concentration is always on the one area as though the whole country were like that. It is not. As I repeatedly said, in the East Midlands and the Eastern region the argument would be the exact opposite. Yet I could make the same speeches proposing these changes. The noble Baroness could not make the same speeches opposing them. I am not seeking to tempt her and I apologise for goading her. I hope that the noble Baroness will not press this amendment. It is not justified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is a very brave man if he issues a challenge to my noble friend Lady Blatch, because she might very well take it up. It is my job to reply, so I am leaping in just in case the Minister has to defend himself further. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out that the amendment was probably not perfect. Despite what the Minister has said, I am still concerned about the imbalance that could result from the vote on regional government, specifically because counties and districts are the areas where new unitary structures must be created. Therefore, in a way, it is important that counties and districts are perhaps even more in favour of regional government and the consequential review of local government than the metropolitan areas are. I do not intend to pursue the amendment today, but I do not promise not to return to it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-16_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, halfway through the previous debate, I thought that the <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister was answering the question on thresholds, but I think he recovered ground and started again. This amendment would insert a new subsection. Amendment No. 59, which is grouped with it, seeks, more importantly, to insert a new schedule. The amendments touch a critical issue: what forms a majority in a referendum? We considered the matter briefly in Committee, but it is essential to probe further.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para4"></a>When such debates have taken place on other Bills, it has inevitably been claimed that amendments such as these are aimed at making it harder for a referendum to pass. Doubtless, we shall hear that from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, if from nowhere else. If they were willing to sell out the future county councils in return for undisclosed promises, sadly we cannot expect them to require a reasonable majority before the abolition of counties. Frankly, the refusal to accept a reasonable threshold test, just like the refusal to accept a plain, straightforward question, has always seemed to say most about the lack of confidence that the exponents of a referendum have in their case.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para5"></a>The Bill embraces very major constitutional change. That change must be made only if it carries not only the majority of voters but substantial public backing. The change in this referendum, as now acknowledged on all Benches in this House, is likely to lead to the abolition of many counties, particularly those in the areas of change. The counties are the oldest administrative divisions in our country, going back as far as Saxon times. They operate effectively, are sensibly sized and provide the traditional roots for every family in the land. People talk about being Cornishmen or from Lancashire or Norfolk. Are not those the instinctive and instantly understandable ways in which the vast majority of people define their being? No one outside the bunker of the Deputy Prime Minister believes that counties and people's associations with them are not important. The referendum to be held under the Bill points only to the abolition of historic counties.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para6"></a>Regional assemblies will weaken our central Parliament, and my noble friend Lady Blatch referred to that fact earlier in our debates. Such constitutional change should not be made on the basis of a bare majority of a tiny turnout in a vote on confusing questions. That is why many other countries require a threshold beyond a bare majority when issues involving constitutional change are at stake. Australia requires a majority of voters nationally and in at least four of the six member states. In the past, New Zealand required a 60 per cent &quot;Yes" vote. In Italy, referendums succeed only if the turnout exceeds 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para7"></a>It is far from frivolous to suggest that we should have thresholds in relation to a matter as far-reaching as that dealt with by the Bill. In a general election-type turnout, a majority of one is sufficient, but the problem occurs at the other end of the spectrum. Given some local election turnouts, one must ask whether a majority of one in a referendum with a low local election-type turnout would give a verdict that was clear and conclusive enough to justify irreversible <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>change. We doubt that, which is why, in Amendment No. 59, we propose a new schedule, in the form of a table.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para8"></a>The amendment would ensure that we avoided a situation in which a majority of one on a dismal turnout would be enough to abolish our historic counties and impose a new layer of bureaucracy. It links turnout to majority. The lower the turnout, the more significant the majority needed. If the turnout is at the level of a strong local election turnout&#151;over 45 per cent&#151;a simple majority will do. However, as the turnout drops&#151;by 5 per cent&#151;so the number required to vote for the proposition increases&#151;by 4 per cent&#151;until, on a turnout of less than 30 per cent, the support of two-thirds of those voting would be needed.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para9"></a>I did not need to carry on with the table. The Government or the Liberal Democrats may wish to argue otherwise, but I hope that it is unlikely that turnout would drop below 30 per cent, although it was less than that in London. I am happy to leave the figure at two-thirds, which is a sufficient majority to affect constitutional change in many countries. Some of your Lordships may say there are cliff edges. That is the case, to some extent. It would be possible to add further sub-divisions to avoid that, but it would complicate the table.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para10"></a>The advantage of such a table is that it combines turnout and majority. That is significant. Including such a table would provide a major incentive to both sides to achieve a good turnout. Noble Lords will see readily from the table that, if some &quot;Noes" do not vote, because they believe that that is the same as voting &quot;No", they will be mistaken. Every &quot;No" who abstains and, therefore, causes the percentage of the poll to drop will, by not voting, increase the proportion voting &quot;Yes". Therefore, the usual accusations made about thresholds are not valid.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para11"></a>If those who say that they favour having a regional assembly were to abstain in the same way as the &quot;Noes", the proposition would be difficult. However, on the assumption that all &quot;Yes" supporters vote and that the regional assemblies are wanted as desperately as those on the Benches opposite say that they are, the figures proposed in the table will ensure that neither side can disproportionately influence the result by not voting.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para12"></a>I do not pretend for a minute that the table is the only solution. I am ready to take guidance on it. Some have said that I am being too generous about a proposition that we oppose in principle&#151;namely, regional government&#151;while others say that we are creating difficulties. That suggests that we have probably got things nearly right. The table is clear and unequivocal. Everyone will know the rules of the game. They will know the criteria against which the result will be measured. That is the sensible way to proceed, in what may be several referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para13"></a>I hope that I will not be told that I am being disruptive; I am certainly not attempting to be so. I hope that we can have a sensible debate about what constitutes a sufficient majority in a referendum of <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such importance. If there is a possibility of low turnouts for referendums that push through change of major constitutional significance, we must address the issue of turnout against majority.
<P>

<a name="30408-16_para14"></a>What we face is the abolition of our 1,200-year old counties to allow the Government to embark on an experiment in the constitutional unknown. That decision requires a clear question and a conclusive result. Amendment No. 59 would contribute to the achievement of that conclusive result. Surely, that is in the interests of those on all sides of the debate, if they want any regional assembly to carry wide acceptance. I commend the amendments to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30408-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has made some interesting points, some of which I agree with. However, we must be careful. If, in this country, we are into having referendums&#151;we have several of them&#151;we must be consistent. We cannot just change the rules for a referendum when we dislike the particular issue before us. The noble Baroness referred to that, when she said that she thought that she had got the thing about right, as her party did not like the idea of regional government.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para0"></a>When I was a local councillor, a previous government&#151;supported by the noble Baroness&#151;told us that, if someone did not bother to vote on whether people should be able to transfer their home, it would be treated as a &quot;Yes" vote. One cannot change one's mind and have different rules just because one dislikes a particular thing or because one wants something in particular to happen. The noble Baroness is right to say that other countries have higher thresholds for referendums and that there are rules for them. However, at this stage of the progress of the Bill, we should not try to change the basic rules that we have for referendums. Some of us on these Benches could make other arguments if we were to make such general changes.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para1"></a>We are getting near to the end of the Report stage, and I must make it clear that, right from the beginning, we have said that we support regional government. As a party, we have talked about it since the time of Gladstone. It has been in various documents that we have published. We have been clear about it and about where we stand on the constitution and any changes to it. Our party has discussed the issue over many years. We have been accused of being muddled, when the opposite is true. We are the only party that has consistently held the same view of constitutional matters for a long time. We hold those views so dearly that, in the run-up to the previous election, we worked with the present Government, before they were elected, to bring some of those things to pass, and they have come to pass. Our attitude to this Bill has been precisely consistent with that. We have been consistent and clear about where we stand on constitutional issues.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para2"></a>As I said, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in moving the amendment, made some valid points with which I agreed. However, we cannot start messing <P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about in the Bill with how we deal with turnouts for referendums. My noble friend Lady Hamwee and the Minister pointed out that, if, at the end of the day, there has not been a high turnout and the results are skewed in one area, the Minister has the option of examining the results and deciding what should happen. On these Benches, we support that.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para3"></a>I am pleased that the Report stage has gone more quickly today. I hope that we will be able to resolve the outstanding issues at Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has made a convincing case for the amendment. She has given us many interesting examples of precedents set in other respected first world countries. I am sorry that the internationalists on the Liberal Democrat Benches have not paid more heed to that.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para4"></a>The amendment is very modest. Regional assemblies represent a definite constitutional change. Assuming a turnout of 25 per cent, which is possible and quite likely, because people are punch-drunk with elections nowadays, if such a constitutional change were to be pushed through with the support of less than 13 per cent of the electorate&#151;which would be the case if only 51 per cent of those voting supported the change&#151;it would be intolerable. All the amendments do is raise the hurdle rate in such a case from approximately 12.6 per cent to approximately 16.6 per cent; a very modest safeguard.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para5"></a>However, I must point out a slight flaw in the drafting of Amendment No. 59. As drafted, if exactly 40 per cent of the electorate voted&#151;that is statistically unlikely, but it could happen&#151;it is unclear whether the threshold would be 54 per cent or 58 per cent. Similarly, if exactly 35 per cent of the electorate voted, it is unclear whether the threshold would be 58 per cent or 62 per cent. That matter needs looking at before the next stage. Apart from that I support the principle of the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, I have not intervened at any stage of the Bill and I apologise to the House for doing so at this late time. I have listened with great interest to the arguments advanced and I have been particularly impressed by my noble friend Lord Waddington's stoic defence of the interests of the North West, whether it be Lancashire or Cheshire. I want the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, to be under no illusions&#151;speaking as someone from North Yorkshire&#151;that feelings are equally strong in North Yorkshire as in the North West. It is for that reason that I rise to support my noble friend's amendments.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para6"></a>The percentage of turnout at local or general elections is largely irrelevant. It is regrettable when it is low, but the important thing is that an election takes place, simply to allow the democratic process to continue. But when we are contemplating a change of this magnitude&#151;as my noble friend Lady Hanham said, the county councils go back for many years and <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are of great historical importance&#151;I see no reason why we should not impose a threshold. It seems logical and it will be wholeheartedly supported in the regions. I know that I will be speaking for a great number of people in the north-east of England when I say that these amendments will be extremely welcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, the Labour Party itself introduced a precedent for such amendments when it wished to give devolution to Scotland in the late 1970s. At that time a minimum proportion of the electorate had to vote. If that proportion was not reached, even if there was a majority in favour of devolution, devolution did not take place, as happened at that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, I find this one of the strangest amendments ever tabled. It says that there will be a referendum and the Electoral Commission will suggest that people vote because we agree with people voting, but we cannot tell them what the value of their vote will be until tomorrow, because if not enough folk turn up it will not have that much value if they want to vote in favour of the proposal. It is almost like saying to voters on 1st May, &quot;If you don't have a 30 per cent turnout in your ward and the winning candidate doesn't have 66 per cent, you won't have a councillor tomorrow, or an MP for that matter".
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para7"></a>I do not believe that this is the right way to proceed in a democracy. I am not keen on referendums but this is one of the many hurdles. I should have thought that the Tories would be overjoyed with this Bill because of the hurdles. Throughout my lifetime, all the changes of a constitutional nature under Conservative Governments have not been tainted with referendums at all, whether it was the abolition of my urban district of Elland in 1973 or the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1986&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   Or the GLC, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   And more, my Lords. There we are. I would not entertain this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I painfully remind the noble Lord that eventually we paid for that policy at the ballot box and that history may repeat itself for the present Government. The Minister will remember that at a previous stage I asked him whether the result of a vote would be binding&#151;I cannot recall the answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-17_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I now know that it is not. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddocks, reminded us that the result of the election is not binding. So what the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, said was a consequence of the amendments is also a consequence of the Bill as drafted. The Minister may take a subjective judgment that the turnout was not robust enough to establish a regional assembly, so when those people vote they still <P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not know what the outcome of the election is to be. That is why Clause 2 states that they may &quot;help to decide" and not that they will decide by their vote.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para8"></a>At least my noble friend Lady Hanham is putting an objective test that, depending on the turnout, a defined percentage will have to be reached. We all know that in local government, county district and unitary authority elections across the land, however low the turnout, a majority of one or more is enough to secure the election of a councillor. But in this election that is not the case. If there are 8 million electors in one area&#151;sorry, the population is 8 million, so I do not know what the number of electors will be, probably 5 million or 6 million; so, if 5 million or 6 million are entitled to vote for an elected assembly and a small percentage do so, they may or may not get one.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para9"></a>I believe that under the rules if there is a marginal &quot;No" vote, the Minister can regard the election as null and void for whatever reason, because the result is not binding, and run another election, because the Bill gives him the power to do so. It is much better to accept an amendment along the lines of my noble friend's. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that we need to look at the interaction between the percentage of voters and the proportion required because exactly 35 per cent or 40 per cent of the electorate may vote and people need to know what that provision means. But the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, has been defeated by that of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and from the Minister's indication of assent to me.
<P>

<a name="30408-17_para10"></a>It is far preferable to have at least a known level of support for this constitutional change. I support my noble friend.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, if I were the Minister I would welcome the amendment because it would formalise my discretion. Having my discretion formalised would mean that, if subsequently I took a decision it would not in fact be discretion because it would be in the Bill and I would not have to argue for it, but I would be in a position where we had established the way in which the vote should be decided in the case of a low poll. It would be a high poll in the local government election and one would probably finish up somewhere in the middle of the range.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para0"></a>The fact of the matter is that 21.7 per cent of the electorate can bring about a major constitutional change if only 35 per cent vote. If 30 per cent vote, 20 per cent can bring about major constitutional change. Below that, it is 20 per cent and 13.2 per cent. On a 10 per cent poll, 6.66 per cent of the electorate can bring about major constitutional change. That is the effect of my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para1"></a>I would have thought that the Minister might find that a reasonable limit on his discretion. I want to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, that this is not the right time to introduce this change. We have had a number of referendums in this country and the big problem we have had&#151;and it goes back to when we <P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were discussing the Scotland Bill&#151;is that we had no formal procedure for them. If we had acted at that stage, we would not be having this argument now .
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para2"></a>However, having started down this road, there is an argument that says that this is not the right time. It will never be the right time. If it is never the right time, we will never do it, but we should have done it long ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, we in this country are suffering from a bout of &quot;referendumitis". In this Bill, not only have we set up arrangements for a referendum on whether we should have regional assemblies, but we have also extended the range of referendums by having one on local government boundaries. We seem to be making it up as we go along.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para3"></a>At the same time, the Government are refusing a referendum on what might be the greatest constitutional change we shall have. That is the result of the Convention on the Future of Europe where there are far-reaching proposals for a change in our constitution and that of other countries. I do not know where we are going on referendums, but it is certain that where constitutional change is involved a simple majority is not good enough. Any golf club which wants to change its constitution must have a 66 and two-thirds majority. Indeed, any organisation worth its salt before it changes its rules and constitution will need far more than a 50 per cent majority. Even the National Union of Mineworkers has a 55 per cent majority rule before people can go out on strike. It is therefore clear that when we want to change the constitution we must have an overwhelming majority. Indeed, if a building society or other business wants to sell its business, it needs a 75 per cent majority.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para4"></a>Here we are, in our great Parliament, talking about changing constitutions with a mere 50 per cent when perhaps only 40 per cent of the electorate are voting. The people who say that we need to get to grips with this problem are right. Whether the amendment gets to grips with it, I do not know. It needs to be considered.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para5"></a>In the House of Commons in 1979&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, will remember it as well as I do&#151;some of us introduced an amendment to the Scotland Bill which provided that 40 per cent of the total electorate voting yes would constitute a majority. It may well be that that simplistic arrangement might work better than the convoluted arrangement in the amendment before us.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para6"></a>I believe that if we are to establish referendums, and if we are serious about it, we should lay down rules which, as regards referendums on constitutional matters, will be standard and understood and will ensure that constitutional change is supported by the large majority of the country.

<A NAME="30408-18_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, we have had a much more interesting debate than occurred in Committee when we discussed an amendment in my name similar to that of my noble friend Lady Hanham. Some people on the Labour Left-wing and the Liberal <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Democrat Party by negating the amendment wanted to reduce debate at this stage, but clearly they have only increased the quality of the discussion. This has been a much better debate and a better-argued one.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para7"></a>I was particularly taken by what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said, based on his experience of another place. The amendment I tabled in Committee was relatively simple in comparison to the effort my noble friend Lady Hanham has made to try to achieve a working compromise for a sensible Bill. But I like the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, because it is equally simple.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para8"></a>It is clear that, despite the letter of 3rd April kindly sent to me by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in reply to the comments I made in Committee, this is a matter that we need seriously to address. It is a key issue in the Bill because we are dealing with a constitutional change. It is a change for which the Government are not taking responsibility: they say that they do not want to change local government and that it is a matter for those who take part in the referendum. If there is a referendum, however small a percentage of the electorate vote, the smallest majority of that will effect a constitutional change. There is no option for those who live in a two-tier system.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para9"></a>I hope that we will read with care what has been said today&#151;there have been many good arguments&#151;and come back at a later stage with a final amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I was not intending to speak, but I am provoked by the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. I am sorry to say that because I am very fond of her. She and I have been and are colleagues in other enterprises. I take exception to what she said in her speech on two counts.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para10"></a>Her doctrine was essentially that of unripe time. I echo what my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said on that matter. I remember the period in another place between 1997 and 2000 when the Government made up the referendums as they went along. I remember challenging Miss Glenda Jackson who was then in charge of a particular Bill on the Government Front Bench. I asked her when the Government were going to put together a formula which would be consistently followed in each of the referendums. She said that those matters were outside her purview and would have to be decided by people greater than she.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para11"></a>We then experienced the results in the Welsh and London referendums and saw relatively low levels of interest in both. Only in 2000, when all those referendums were out of the way, did the Government come around to formalising matters in the 2000 Act. Therefore, doctrine of unripe time does not in my view apply. It seems perfectly proper that we should examine these matters if that is the example which the Government set in the first instance.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para12"></a>I have a second reservation about what the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said. It was that the Liberal Democrat objection to parties being elected to power at <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Westminster when the party achieves only 43 per cent of the vote seems to run counter to the objections that she is raising to these patterns today. I merely make the remark philosophically and temperamentally.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para13"></a>Yesterday the Minister said (at col. 101 of the Official Report) that the electorate is now much more savvy about matters such as the ones we are discussing today. However, a turnout of 25 per cent, based on the results in Wales and London, seems to be a perfectly reasonable supposition as regards the kind of vote we shall see in these referendums. Twenty-five per cent is not a respectable total vote for introducing massive change, particularly when one goes down to what would be the even majority. It is right that the hurdle should be higher, as my noble friend Lady Hanham has proposed in her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wish to make a minor point. I shall say very clearly the name of my noble friend Lady Maddock. I am sure that she will be grateful if noble Lords take note that she is not plural; she is very singular indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak briefly on this issue. I hope that a referendum will be held in the North East. How are we to explain to people living in the north-east of England, close to the Scottish Border, that restrictions will be placed around the numbers of people voting for or against, when the Scottish Assembly has been set up next door which was not subject to those kinds of restrictions?
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para14"></a>What the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said was perfectly true. If these were the first ever referendums, then possibly there would be a stronger argument, but certainly not at this point. It would be totally unfair to the people of the North East if they do decide to hold a referendum. I hope that my noble friend will resist these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, to get it out of the way, I shall declare an interest. In 1978 I voted for the 40 per cent rule. I did so for a reason. Some of my noble friends in this House may well have been in the Chamber in another place that night. It was one of probably only two occasions during my 27 years in another place where one speech made to a full House changed the vote. It was the speech made by George Cunningham, who moved the amendment. That speech was an absolute classic. The place was packed and most Members were against the proposal because it looked so arbitrary.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para15"></a>I shall not go into the details, but George Cunningham's speech completely changed people's minds on how they would vote that night, and I was one of them. So I plead guilty. The result was a botched referendum in Scotland, which resulted in a &quot;Yes" vote that could not get over the hurdle. That may have been the other side of the coin referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch: we paid the political price for it and learnt the lesson.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para16"></a>We are now in the position where we are following the precedent set in Scotland, in Wales, in Northern Ireland and in London. It would be absolutely crazy <P>


<a name="column_189"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and unfair if we were to change the rules for any proposed regional referendums when we have already held referendums in so many other areas of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30408-18_para17"></a>It is true and I can confirm that the referendums would be advisory. There is no issue about that. When we originally discussed this matter in Committee I also remarked that if the turnout was very low&#151;I cannot put a figure on it&#151;and the majority was very small&#151;again, I cannot and will not put a figure on it&#151;the Secretary of State would have to consider the result and think long and hard about the way forward. On the other hand, because the referendum would be advisory&#151;

I am repeating the remarks I made in Committee. Indeed, my noble friend has been in the Chamber for most of the six days that we have debated this Bill. Perhaps he was out of the Chamber at the time. Because the referendums will be advisory, the Secretary of State will have to make a judgment, go to another place, make his views known and be tested on them.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para0"></a>I am not going to say what I was about to say because that will just wind noble Lords up. If a referendum is advisory, the result could be looked at in another way: the Minister might be on the borderline and make an irrational decision which would be absolutely crazy. However, the point I seek to make is that the referendums would not be binding.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para1"></a>I shall contradict only one point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. If there were a &quot;No" vote on a small majority, the Secretary of State could not then order another referendum. For heaven's sake, yesterday we debated for over an hour the question of whether a five-year gap before holding another referendum after a &quot;No" result would be sufficient. How, then, could the Secretary of State order on a whim another referendum because he did not like the result? Last night we debated whether the gap should be five years or 10 years. Obviously memories are short.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para2"></a>We have already debated this. It is our view that there is no obvious way of deciding what should be the threshold. Our previous debate on Amendment No. 49 concerned votes in the counties and districts, and served as a form of threshold, which is why I have used the term. It provides a hurdle, a point at which to assess a decision. It would not depend on a straightforward and simple majority vote. It would serve as a threshold in a similar way to the proposed arithmetical figures.

<P>

<a name="30408-19_para3"></a>Because there is no obvious way of setting a threshold level other than by a simple majority&#151;which is the tried and tested way of doing things in this country&#151;we want to stick to it. Otherwise an unfair advantage is given to those people who do not choose to vote. We want to encourage more people to vote.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para4"></a>It does not work in the same way in a general election. It has been a while since we had a perverse result, where a party wins the overall majority of votes in the country but secures only a minority of seats in another place. It has happened, but it did not bring about the constitutional rows that I thought it should have done at the time. If it happened today, however, I am sure that something would be said.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para5"></a>There are certain perverse issues attached to going for a simple majority, but to find a working threshold that is acceptable to most people is difficult. This was tested in another place and several amendments were tabled regarding what percentage of the electorate had to vote. The majority of the proposals varied between 25 per cent and 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para6"></a>I do not rest my case on the point, but we have examples of other countries which have put in place rules on referendum thresholds. No one has mentioned what happened recently in Serbia. Its threshold led to the most perverse difficulties when the Prime Minister sought to form a government. As I have said, thresholds can work in very perverse ways.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para7"></a>We need to set our minds to the task of maximising the number of people who freely want to vote on the basis of the information made available to them. We want to switch them on and enthuse them about the issues. That may be difficult in some cases, on the basis of what I have said in the past. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, also made the point: no new powers, no new money, but some people are willing to enthuse about the chance to give a voice to their region and the chance to have a say in the allocation of the existing massive levels of public expenditure. It is up to those involved, but persuading the maximum number of people to go out to vote either way is extremely important.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para8"></a>What happens at Third Reading is up to noble Lords, but I cannot see any formula that will work better than a simple majority, bearing in mind that the Secretary of State will have to make a judgment based on the turnout and the majority, and taking into account whether the result is clear cut. He will have to decide whether a &quot;Yes" result has provided a sufficient steer for him to decide to proceed on to the publication of a Bill and the setting up of an elected regional assembly. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the amendment has generated a fascinating debate on the whole matter of what justifies the acceptance of a vote. I am grateful for having been credited with working out the schedule proposed in Amendment No. 59. However, in all honesty I have to say that it is a slightly attenuated schedule originally put forward by my late noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. I bow to no one in <P>


<a name="column_191"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>saying that my brain would be a pea in comparison to his brain. He worked out the table. I hope that noble Lords will accept that it was the effort of someone who had very considerable experience in this area. At the time I believe that Lord Mackay was trying to influence the debate on the ultimate form of the Scottish Assembly. We know now that some of those Assembly votes were quite derisory, as indeed they were for elected mayors.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para9"></a>I worry a lot when I think that the Secretary of State will have to make the decision about the threshold below which a referendum decision will not be accepted. The current thresholds where the referendum decision has been accepted are pitiful. My noble friend has already referred to the fact that turnout in London was 27 per cent; it was lower than that in Wales, and we have already heard about the monkey that was voted in with about 13 per cent. On those bases, our constitutional arrangement for referendums is laughable. The percentage of the vote in favour was not justifiable. If we want something that is lasting and enduring, we must at least try to establish that its original base was correct and there was sufficient support when it was originally introduced to justify changes being made.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para10"></a>As my noble friend Lord Peel reminded us, the county councils have been the senior level of government for many years; they have been the base of government in the rural areas. For them, this is a hugely important time&#151;it is a watershed for some of them. It would be absolutely wrong for county councils to be disestablished on the basis of a frivolous and trivial vote.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para11"></a>I thank all those who have contributed to the debate, from which I take considerable heart. I have taken note of the points, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about the result of the way in which the schedule works. I should like to consider those points further and decide whether to bring the matter back at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

They are necessary because of the situations that may arise now we will be having local government referendums in parallel with regional referendums.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para23"></a>Amendment No. 55 gives the Secretary of State discretion to require that the commission give advice in relation to a specified number of options. Let me give noble Lords an example of when we might need to do this. There could be a legal challenge to the result of a local government referendum but the regional referendum was not subject to challenge and showed a clear majority in favour of an elected assembly. In that situation, we might want the Electoral Commission to be able to start work on advising on electoral matters for the assembly. But it would need to do so on the basis of different potential local government options being implemented, since the Secretary of State would not be able to confirm what would be implemented in the area subject to challenge. That is why we need to be able to direct the commission to come up with advice based on different options.
<P>

<a name="30408-19_para24"></a>Amendment No. 55 is consequential. Amendment No. 56 enables the Secretary of State to vary the direction outside the two-year period. This is in case the result of a repeat referendum is not available until after the expiry of the two-year period. Such a result would clarify the future local government structure and would warrant a revised direction. These are necessary amendments. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I can be brief on Amendment No. 56A. It seems like a small point, but on rereading the Bill, I saw that it said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may make a grant to any person in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with the activities of a regional chamber".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para7"></a>
That does not explain whether such a person is from the regional chamber, totally independent of the chamber or from another body.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para8"></a>A regional chamber that commissions work, establishes a partnership with an individual and/or another body or wishes some activity within its remit to be carried out by another person should commission that project and grant the money for it. If there is to be government funding,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in connection with the activities of a regional chamber"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para9"></a>
the chamber must make the case for that activity. It must set out the cost of the project for which it is accepting bids. The grant should be made out to the chamber, which should then allocate the funding to whoever is carrying out the activity.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para10"></a>This is important because, as the Bill stands, any person could claim that he is carrying out work which is an activity of a regional chamber. It might be a self-appointed person&#151;we really do not know. There is a great overlap of activities between regional chambers, regional development agencies, regional assemblies and many other bodies in the region. Therefore, it should be made explicit that the regional chamber should make the case for receiving a grant from the Secretary of State and should then allocate the money to the person carrying out the activity. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, in reply to the amendment, I hope that the Minister will remind us why it is thought necessary at this stage to take the power to make a grant to a regional chamber considering that we have had regional chambers for some time now, and they seem to have got on quite nicely without any grant from the government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I can be as brief as the noble Baroness was in moving the amendment. Part of the explanation is in paragraph 74 of the Notes on Clauses. However, I have a better, plain-English version, which I will put on the record.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para11"></a>Amendment No. 56A would require the Secretary of State to make the grants to the chamber rather than any person. This would be completely and utterly impractical. We do not currently pay grants directly to the seven chambers which are unincorporated associations because that would mean the grant would be recovered from the pocket of one or more members of the chamber should recovery prove necessary. Instead, we pay the grant for unincorporated chambers to an accountable body. An accountable body may be a local authority or an organisation such as a regional local government employers' association, which has legal standing. For example&#151;I can list these all, if need be&#151;we pay the grant to an east of England local government conference and to the Wakefield metropolitan borough council on behalf of its regional chambers. The Bill as drafted would allow us <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to continue these different secure routes for the funding of the chambers. Some are incorporated, some are unincorporated and some are about to become limited companies&#151;but the accountable body in each case is not the chamber. For example, Northumberland County Council is the accountable body in the case of the North East Assembly.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para12"></a>Currently, we make the grant for activities under the regional chambers fund such as in respect of scrutiny of the chambers' regional development agency under Section 126(1) of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may, with the consent of the Treasury, give financial assistance to any person in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with activities which contribute to the regeneration or development of an area".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para13"></a>
The words &quot;any person" in the Bill follow that precedent. Grants are made to the legal &quot;any person", therefore the entity&#151;not to any Tom, Dick or Harry. 
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para14"></a>I draw the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, to paragraphs 73 and 74 of the Explanatory Notes, which refer to the funding of regional chambers. It would be ridiculous for me to read that guidance into the record but it explains the reasons for the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I know that the Minister has fought his corner very hard to achieve more clarity in some of the legalese before us. I am sure that the noble Lord is as frustrated as I ever was as a Minister, when the argument is made that because certain wording was used for a previous statute, new legislation must abide by it.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para15"></a>In plain English, the Bill says that the Secretary of State may make a grant to &quot;any person". If it said&#151;as the Minister explained and the Explanatory Notes make clear&#151;that grants will be made to an accountable body, that would make more sense. At least that would smack of accountability and indicate that the body receiving the funding would be accountable. The fact that the words &quot;any person" have appeared in previous statutes is no answer. I am not happy, but I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

If all noble Lords speak for no more than 15 minutes, we should finish within the time limit.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what arrangements are being put in place for commissioning specialised health services from April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para26"></a>The noble Lords said: My Lords, I am very grateful for that announcement, as it was going to be rather difficult to stick to the 10-minute limit on my introductory speech. This subject is one in which the House has shown considerable interest and is an area that affects the lives of millions of ordinary patients.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para27"></a>Specialised services are defined by reference to the national specialised services definitions set, the first version of which was published in December 2001. Excluding the highly specialised national set, the definitions number 35 conditions and cover services provided to catchment populations of more than 1 million&#151;that is, those covering more than one primary care trust. They include burn care, rare cancers, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy surgery, hepatology, infectious diseases, perinatal pathology and psychotherapy specialised services. That is a considerable number of specialised areas, each of which has a great effect on the individual's life.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para28"></a>In its 1999&#150;2000 report, the national specialist commissioning advisory group remarked that a common characteristic of low-volume services and treatments was that they were often provided at high cost, requiring specialist technical expertise and a concentration of clinical care. With specialised services, annual activity is often unpredictable and treatments are expensive. Providers may treat patients from all over the country.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para29"></a>Haemophilia is a typical example. Some 6,000 people are affected, costing about &pound;115 million per annum to treat. Within that total, &pound;20 million is spent on patients with inhibitors&#151;that is, resistance to treatment with factor VIII or IX as appropriate. Immune tolerance treatment for such patients typically costs at least &pound;1 million per patient&#151;a very high figure. In this context, one new patient in a PCT area can severely dent a budget.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para30"></a>The key document, Shifting the Balance of Power proposed that the PCTs should,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"commission specialist services for the appropriate size of population often covering several PCTs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para31"></a><P>

<a name="30408-20_para32"></a>That was designed to replace the previous system where health authorities collaborated in commissioning specialised services through regional specialised commissioning groups.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para33"></a>During debate on the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, considerable concern was expressed by Members of both Opposition Benches about the proposed devolution of specialised commissioning to primary care trusts. In particular, it was not clear how local commissioning would deliver clinical effectiveness, equity of access and economic viability any more than the previous model. There was no clear reason for changing the key factors that had led to the establishment of specialised commissioning. There was doubt about the level of expertise in PCTs to commission such services. There was concern that many specialisms would be damaged because of uncertainty. There was particular concern that specialised services would be subjected to the same local cost pressures as any other service and would receive low priority within PCTs because of the relatively low numbers within the local population depending on them. There was concern also that important developments led by regional specialised commissioning groups would be delayed by the change.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para34"></a>The Government assured us that PCTs would be expected to band together in effective commissioning consortiums but that strategic health authorities and health and social care directorates would exert influence in case of need. Ministers also assured us during the passage of the 2002 Act that it was better to have joint working between PCTs to deal with commissioning than,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"some rather arbitrary definition, inevitably by central government, about which functions should be dealt with at a different level from PCTs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para35"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, added:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The thrust of the Government's approach is to devolve, but to set very clear outcomes and standards to be achieved rather than to second guess the mechanisms in detail".&#151;[Official Report, 16/5/02; col. 445.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para36"></a><P>

<a name="30408-20_para37"></a>We were assured that the new consortiums would be a means of sharing risk, so that there would be no postcode lottery in future. Transition arrangements were agreed by the department to procure stability for the first year, after the implementation of Shifting the Balance of Power. Regional specialised commissioning groups were continued for a further year, with primary care trust members replacing the former health authority members. It was explicitly stated that consortium arrangements created under the auspices of current RSCGs should be continued, with PCTs honouring existing financial commitments.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para38"></a>In what seemed subsequently like a loss of confidence, John Hutton, the Minister of State, announced a review of specialised commissioning in March 2002 with a view to issuing guidance on arrangements to be implemented from April 2003. That was originally promised for last autumn. The consultation exercise to inform the review ended on 30th September 2002 but no announcement of the outcome was made until last week&#151;right at the beginning of the 2003&#150;2004 financial year.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para39"></a>The long-awaited guidance on specialised commissioning was published on 3rd April. Frankly, it has cleared up very little of the confusion. The guidance <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a mere 27 paragraphs long and leaves many questions unanswered. I hope the noble Baroness will be able to answer them tonight. In summary, it says that PCTs are expected to work collaboratively and that they are responsible for establishing such groups, while strategic health authorities are responsible for oversight and performance management. Arrangements should encompass two broad groupings, with planning populations of 1 to 2 million on level 1 and 3 to 6 million on level 2. When RSCGs are working in line with the guidance, there is no need to change them. When a specialised service has a planning population greater than 6 million&#151;in other words, fewer than eight specialist centres&#151;level 2 groups should consider working together. Finally, decisions of collaborative groups should be binding on all PCT members.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para40"></a>A sample establishment agreement and performance assessment framework for collaborative commissioning groups is included with the guidance as appendices. The guidelines therefore appear to stick closely to the devolved approach to commissioning outlined in Shifting the Balance of Power: The Next Steps. Nevertheless, they are vague in the extreme and raise a huge number of questions.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para41"></a>The future of RSCGs, in so far as they still exist, is still extremely uncertain. It is unclear whether these bodies universally have a future after 2004, even in the light of Hazel Blears's statement in January that their lives are to be extended until 2004. It seems that only some will be retained. What will happen to existing consortia, such as the Pan Thames Consortium for Haemophilia?
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para42"></a>The primary care trusts that join the consortia will apparently continue to have complete discretion about whether they want to prioritise spending on particular specialised areas and join an individual consortium. What happens if a PCT declines to join a consortium, or a level 1 consortium declines to join the appropriate level 2 collaborative commissioning group? The continuing RSCGs or level 2 consortia appear to have no power to compel primary care trusts to join consortia. Will the strategic health authorities be able to do so? It appears that they can performance manage, but have no power to compel. Should not the arrangements in some cases be mandatory rather than purely voluntary? There is the question whether the 75 per cent rule, which at least ensured that the old health authorities were bound by consortia decisions, is still applicable to ensure that PCTs are bound by those decisions.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para43"></a>We were told during the passage of the Act that the role of the strategic health authority would be to oversee the consortia arrangements, with regional directors of health and social care ensuring that the specialised services that go beyond strategic health authorities are also delivered properly within that region. Where is that stated in the guidance? How much executive authority will RSCGs or level 2 consortia have? What will their duties be? Who will ensure that commissioning collaboratives are created and quality maintained?

<a name="30408-20_para44"></a>Will the definition set continue to be published and developed? What plans does the department have to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangements in the coming year? Where have the data on which the new guidance is based? Last September, a survey by the department as part of the review, which was leaked to The Times, showed that most PCTs were struggling in many specialisms to engage with the issues of specialised commissioning among their responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para45"></a>Many patients' organisations, clinicians and, indeed, the Specialised Commissioning Alliance can testify to the fact that development of specialised commissioning has been patchy. Has the preparedness of PCTs to assume responsibility for specialised commissioning improved markedly since the department conducted its review last year? Do PCTs now have the necessary specialised commissioning expertise?
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para46"></a>What about funding and earmarked budgets? Given the late date of publication for financial planning purposes of the guidance, will the department protect spending on specialised services in real terms for a further year? What will the obligations of PCTs be as regards setting aside funds for collaborative commissioning or RSCGs? What happens to existing service agreements for specialised services after April 2003? The issue of risk sharing is important. What will encourage PCTs on this score to join in with consortia rather than follow their self-interest when very few of their patients need a particular specialised service?
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para47"></a>We on these Benches are concerned that the new guidance does not follow the views expressed in the consultation. A great demand in the consultation, from 75 per cent spread evenly across all categories, believed that PCTs should be required to delegate authority for specialised commissioning to consortia. The guidance seems to cut strongly across that. Has the majority in the consultation that supported a national group for planning purposes and a national framework for commissioning been ignored, or is this a matter for a level 2 group?
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para48"></a>We on these Benches have always been concerned that the new commissioning arrangements could be highly detrimental to patient care. We are concerned that specialised services should not be left to compete with mainstream service priorities in PCT budgets. Our concern is that some PCTs may choose not to commission via consortia, which would mean block contracts and great difficulties for specialised services. The outcome would be a resurgence of postcode prescribing as PCTs struggle to accommodate the unpredictable and sizeable expenditure associated with many specialised conditions.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para49"></a>The Government's proposals in this area take a blanket view that all centralisation is bad and that decentralisation is good for all purposes. We on these Benches have always believed that devolution is best done to the appropriate level. It is not always a question of pushing everything down to the lowest possible level. The appropriate level is where the expertise and resources are best deployed. We have considerable concerns about the Government's proposal. We look forward to the Minister's reply.

<A NAME="30408-20_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for not being in the Chamber when he began his speech. I was taken by surprise when the dinner-hour debate started at 6.45 p.m.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para50"></a>I want to thank the noble Lord for asking a Question about what is an important issue for patients requesting special services from their family doctor or primary care trust. Prior to April 2002, health authorities commissioned specialised services. I speak from my position as a non-executive director and vice-chairman of the primary care trust for Birkenhead and Wallasey, which serves 220,000 people on Merseyside.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para51"></a>Specialised health services are now commissioned by primary care trusts on behalf of their strategic health authority. In Merseyside and Cheshire, a specialist commissioning team of hospital consultants, GPs, managers, pharmacists and patients' representatives handle requests for specialised health services. This zonal commissioning team is based in Central Cheshire PCT, and serves a population of over 2.5 million people. There are three zones in our region in the North West.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para52"></a>Representation on the commissioning team comes from all PCTs and the strategic health authority in Merseyside and Cheshire. Decisions made by the commissioning team or consortium are binding on all member PCTs. The budget for commissioning specialised health services comes from the 0.5 per cent of the &quot;weighted" allocation of each participating PCT. The &quot;weighted" allocation is determined by the size of population served and the proportion of vulnerable residents such as infants, young children and older people as well as their &quot;deprivation index".
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para53"></a>Commissioning of specialised services is in response to requests from three sources: first, patients who approach their GPs; secondly, hospital consultants providing specialised services defined by the Department of Health; and, thirdly, health professionals using appraisals and guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence&#151;NICE. Specialised services are defined by reference to the specialised services national definitions set. In December 2002, 36 services were listed by the Department of Health as specialised. They fell into two groups, as the noble Lord explained: specialised services with planning populations around 1 to 2 million and specialised services with planning populations around 3 to 6 million that usually cover a whole region.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para54"></a>In the first group commissioned by PCTs in a consortium are services related to cancer, cardiac surgery, child and adolescent mental health (tier 4 in the National Service Framework), liver disorders, low secure psychiatric services, neonatal intensive care, neurosurgery and renal/kidney replacement therapy. Of these services the most requested in our zone are coronary artery revascularisation surgery available at cardio-thoracic centres. Specialised hospitals also approach zonal commissioning teams to sell their services.
<P>


<a name="column_200"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para55"></a>The most recent issue for consideration by PCTs was a new drug for liver and bile duct cancers whose review has not been completed by NICE. The zonal commissioning team consulted NICE, which supported the use of this new and effective drug. The drug is now being purchased.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para56"></a>Specialised services with planning populations of 3 to 6 million are in a larger list that includes AIDS/HIV treatment, blood and bone marrow transplant, severe burns, cleft lip and palate, genetic services, medium and high secure psychiatric services, paediatric intensive care, morbid obesity, rare cancers, spinal injury and pulmonary hypertension. I should point out, however, that this is not an exhaustive list.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para57"></a>There is growing interest in the question of whether the current system of commissioning specialised services is giving more satisfaction and more promptly than the former one commissioned by district health authorities. For the past 12 months, specialised services have been commissioned by PCTs that are closer to local patients than was the case with health authorities. Together with other national initiatives such as &quot;Patients Choice" for coronary artery surgery&#151;I declare my interest as a national trustee of this scheme, co-ordinated by the British Heart Foundation&#151;we are receiving fewer complaints of patients waiting more than six months for treatment.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para58"></a>But treatment for rare diseases, such as liver and bile duct cancers, continue to pose problems for commissioners, even when NICE guidelines recommend them. The prescribing budget of PCTs is still inadequate for expensive drug treatments. In areas of health inequalities, more prescriptions are written to treat a population whose health status is worse than that of their economically better-off neighbours.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para59"></a>The availability of NICE reviews and guidelines has reduced professional arguments about treatment options but increased patients' demand and expectations for effective and expensive treatment being readily available through local doctors and hospitals. This is not always the case. Some patients have had to wait for treatment.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para60"></a>Another issue that continues to challenge commissioners in PCTs is that of inadequate specialised services; for example, on Merseyside and Cheshire paediatric infectious diseases are a case in point. We have only one consultant. As a result of this limitation, adult physicians are treating children in some districts. The situation can be overcome by sending our patients to Manchester, or further away to Birmingham. But parents are not happy to travel 50 miles, or more, to be with their sick child. Another example is the shortage of paediatricians with skills in managing epilepsy in children. So the jury is still out on some aspects of commissioning specialised services.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para61"></a>In ethnic minority communities, genetic services for the diagnosis and management of inherited blood diseases, such as sickle-cell disease and thalassaemia, are still limited to a few centres in London, Birmingham and Manchester. But increasing numbers of black Africans and Caribbean people have been living and growing up in the United Kingdom since the <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>end of the Second World War. So why have services for their inherited anaemias not been developed systematically in the NHS? There is a feeling among many black people that services of special significance to them are ignored while equally uncommon genetic diseases affecting white people receive funding. It is now time for government to dispel that impression.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para62"></a>I look forward to the Minister's reply on these unresolved issues associated with commissioning specialised health services.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for giving us the opportunity to have this important debate. Before I begin, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. I have not had the chance to speak on such matters since he took his place on the Back Benches. I should like to pay tribute to his efforts over the past four years. I have in mind in particular his efforts as regards the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002, both of which will make such a difference to children in helping them to fulfil their potential in the future.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para63"></a>In outline, I seek assurance from the Minister that the health needs of children in care will not be overlooked. Such children very often have very particular needs. I would not like the restructuring of the NHS to lead to this group of children being overlooked in the future. I am especially concerned about the situation of youngsters in children's homes. I believe that there are now only about 5,000 children in such residential settings. That is partly due to the fact that such homes have developed a very poor reputation over recent years. I refer to the abuse of children in the North Wales case, and in other areas of the country, along with the relevant reports. As a consequence staff working in these homes have often become quite demoralised. They have encountered what they perceive to be a lack of respect from the public, and from professional colleagues working with children in other disciplines.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para64"></a>Yet children's homes can provide an appropriate setting for some children in care. Indeed, the majority of children in care in Germany reside in children's homes and group settings. Nevertheless, such staff are often faced with very troubled and challenging children. The latter are becoming more and more challenging because the policy has been to keep children in their families as far as possible. One respects and values that policy, but, as a consequence, some children are often very damaged by the time that they arrive in a children's home.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para65"></a>On a recent visit to a children's home, I arrived to find both a police van and a police car outside the premises. The previous evening one of the children had been in discussion with one of the staff, who had been sitting in the front seat of her car. The child had punched the staff member in the face. Another recent case involved staff of a home preparing for the arrival of a child. That child, who had learning difficulties, was known to have an interest in martial arts and a <P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tendency to lose his temper quite easily. Again, there can be cases regarding young girls; for example, staff at the children's home might suspect that a 13 year-old girl could be pregnant. However, she is not prepared to tell them what is happening to her. Similarly, a 15 year-old girl may be at risk of entering prostitution. She may arrive at the home late at night carrying gifts from her boyfriend which suggests that she could be running such a risk.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para66"></a>The staff in such homes are acting in loco parentis. They are the closest carers for these most troubled and challenging children. As we all know, such staff have been neglected for many years in terms of support and training. The Government have made moves in the right direction to improve the situation through the Quality Protects programme, the new national minimum standards for residential homes for children and the development of a statement of purpose in children's homes. I welcome those improvements.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para67"></a>It is important that the recommendations of the Warner report entitled Choosing with Care&#151;my noble friend Lord Warner led the inquiry which considered the selection, development and management of staff in children's homes&#151;are followed. The report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Children's homes should have a therapeutic and developmental role . . .  Such an approach, however, requires homes to have ready access to psychiatric, psychological and psychotherapy professionals to train, supervise and support the home's staff.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para68"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Often the most cost effective and appropriate role for professional specialists is that of supporting staff in children's homes who are working directly with children . . .  'the best [professionals] recognise that some continuing relationship with the home is the proper context in which to offer their expertise'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para69"></a>
The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that there is scope for using the professional NHS or educational specialists to train, advise and support staff in homes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para70"></a>
Among the many benefits of such support is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the status of staff will be enhanced as they take on a more professional role with respect to children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-20_para71"></a>
From my own experience, I support strongly the report's recommendations. I visited recently a home which had access every three weeks to a consultation from a psychotherapist from the Tavistock Clinic. The purpose of such support on a regular, continuing and frequent basis is to help staff to think about the children with whom they work and the impact of that work on themselves. Some years ago, I visited a hostel run by Centrepoint which had such support on a weekly basis. The hostel was dealing with some of the most challenging children. I was recommended to visit it by outreach workers working with young homeless people. They were sending their most troubled children to Buffy House in Olympia. What was remarkable was that that hostel, working with some of the most difficult children, had the lowest level of staff sickness in the whole of the Centrepoint organisations. Such high quality professional consultation for staff in children's homes reduces stress on staff and encourages them to engage in professional development. I am advised that there is plenty of evidence that it works. It is increasingly considered to be good practice. I hope that the new national minimum standards for residential <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>care and the statements of mission for children's homes will be the tools by which it will be recognised that that should be a fundamental service widely available to staff in children's homes.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para72"></a>My concern&#151;other noble Lords have raised such concerns today&#151;relates to health services for small groups which demand specialist input. There is a great shortage of child psychologists. I am anxious that when the need is recognised, there will be no agency through which to commission such services. I should appreciate assurances from the Minister that these services will be provided for when need is identified. Access to consultation with an appropriately trained mental health professional on a regular basis is as important and useful to staff in children's homes as is the use of a hard hat and a pair of steel-capped boots for a person working on a building site. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<A NAME="30408-20_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asks a most important Question. I, too, have to apologise to the noble Lord: I was not in my place at the beginning of his speech. I was travelling back from Stoke Mandeville where His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales was opening the most wonderful new sports stadium for disabled people. As every single traffic light was at red, I can tell your Lordships that I was sweating.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para73"></a>At the Report stage of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Bill 2002, several noble Lords who are present today debated on 29th April the national specialist services and their commissioning. I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Minister at that time, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. He was one of the hardest working Ministers this House has ever had. Even though the noble Lord did not accept the amendment on specialist services, I miss him and his presence today.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para74"></a>Noble Lords are present tonight because since the middle of 2002 patient organisations, advocacy groups and professional bodies have been expressing their collective concerns about the proposed arrangements and the expected disruption to services and patient care. I am sure the Minister has anticipated that we should like positive assurances that the specialist services will be given the chance to develop and build on their expertise and will not be put at risk by PCT commissioners. We are considering life and death situations and specialist rehabilitation services which only special centres of excellence have the skills and expertise to deliver.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para75"></a>I should declare an interest, having broken my back many years ago resulting in paralysis. I have benefited from the expertise of specialised treatment at a spinal injuries centre. I founded the Spinal Injuries Association and am its president. I know that it is one organisation which will read with interest the Government's reply to this debate.
<P>


<a name="column_204"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para76"></a>If patients are not referred to spinal units when they sustain an injury which leaves them paralysed they are at risk of developing horrendous pressure sores which can cause months if not years of extra time in hospital at a cost of millions of pounds. Spinal patients treated in general hospitals have the difficult problem of having to deal with inexperienced staff who do not know or will not learn how to undertake a manual evacuation of the bowels. That is one of the most difficult and upsetting procedures for paralysed people if there is no system in place. Moreover, the urinary tract, which is prone to infection, needs expert attention, as do blood pressure problems. The psychological aspects are equally important.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para77"></a>All sorts of specialised units are desperate for reassurance. They need to have dedicated teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, psychologists and volunteers. They need to know that the money meant for their unit is getting there and is not being milked off for the needs of other parts of the trust. They need to be audited and monitored. Above all, we need to know how the arrangements for commissioning will work. I hope that the Minister will spell that out tonight in a way which is acceptable to all.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para78"></a>Spinal units are at risk of bed blocking. Patients need to leave hospital when they are ready. So often, however, they have to remain because of impossible arrangements in their homes. They may not have a wheelchair or other necessary equipment, or a care package may not have been prepared.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para79"></a>I pay tribute to Mr El Masri, the spinal surgeon at the spinal unit at Oswestry. He is dedicated to his patients and has worked tirelessly to build a new unit fit for this century. The unit has two bungalows, each with four rooms, so that patients who are ready for discharge but awaiting social services or the fulfilment of housing needs can leave hospital. Patients can stay in these halfway houses, called Trans House, which stop them becoming institutionalised and bored and help to relieve bed blocking. If the Minister has time to visit the unit at Oswestry and other such houses, I am sure that she will wish to congratulate the people there. Their hard work and fundraising have produced such a good outcome.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para80"></a>Last week, someone I know from Norfolk, a paraplegic who has lost a considerable amount of weight and been involved in investigations, learned that she needs to have a spinal unit assessment of her condition. She has been told that she will have to go privately as her home trust is outside the area. Do we have a National Health Service or do we not? Norfolk does not have a spinal unit, and the situation is similar in many other parts of the country. What is happening to extra-contractual referrals and out-of-area treatments? What are they going to be called now? It is vital that patients who need specialised treatment, wherever and whatever the need, receive it.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para81"></a>I do not want to be seen as partisan. I know the importance of specialisation in so many fields of medicine. In dealing with HIV/AIDS and Parkinson's disease, for example, the monitoring of drugs and research is vital if progress is to be made. One therefore <P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>wants consultants who are interested and trained and able to approach the issue on a worldwide basis. Complications occur in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension if the correct diagnosis is not made. Getting patients to the experts quickly saves not only money in the long run, but much suffering for patients and their families.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para82"></a>If the Government wash their hands of the responsibilities of providing specialised healthcare services, the gaps will get larger. I hope that the Minister will spell out how PCTs will manage to organise these services for their populations and, if they fail, who will pick up the casualties. What will be the position of the strategic health authorities? The worldwide Internet tells patients and their friends what is possible. It will not be good for the Government if the UK falls behind. There must be good staff to look after patients, there must be possibilities for research and development and suitable transport for patients and their visitors to reach places of treatment which may be far from their homes. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-20_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, no one should conclude from the short list of speakers in this debate that its subject matter is of little importance. Quite the opposite is true. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is to be congratulated on having tabled this Question on a day which could hardly be bettered in terms of relevance and topicality. Those of us here who are veterans of the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Bill a year ago need no reminding of the debates that we had on specialised commissioning during both Committee and Report stages. Those debates underscored the doubts felt by many, both inside and outside this Chamber, that the model being proposed by the Government for commissioning specialised services was badly flawed. In the end, of course, no amendment to the Bill was pressed; but I venture to say that that was no reflection of the government response, which did very little to allay the concerns that we all had.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para83"></a>As if to acknowledge those concerns, Mr Hutton announced in March of last year that there was to be a review of the whole issue, which indeed there duly was. One must not be too churlish about this. Unlike some consultations I can think of, this one had all the signs of being a genuine listening exercise. The only trouble is that for an inordinately long time after that it was we who found ourselves listening. Until the end of last week, we were still listening for a statement of what exactly is going to happen and how the new system is going to function. Ever since the end of last year, we have been told that an announcement on this critical issue would be made &quot;shortly". So it was a great relief to learn, on the cusp of the new financial year, that definitive guidance had actually been published by the department.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para84"></a>I should say straight away that our recent concerns about delay and uncertainty were not abstract worries about the process. What matters in all of this is of course the patient. The Minister will know that there has been great concern among patient organisations <P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that gaps are appearing in the provision of services. We have just had a supposedly transitional period in which the regional specialised commissioning groups have continued to oversee the setting up of PCT consortia. That was undoubtedly the right decision. It was the absolute minimum needed to try to ensure some degree of stability and continuity as the new commissioning arrangements were being assimilated and put in place. But the Minister will also know that there is widespread agreement out there that the RSCGs have by no means outlived their usefulness. Many believe that they have a permanent role to play in commissioning services which are best planned across several strategic health authorities, with a population of perhaps three million to six million people.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para85"></a>It is pleasing to see in the new guidance that the Government have heeded those concerns by saying, in effect, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it". RSCGs, where the arrangements are currently working well, are not now to be disturbed. As I said just now, I do not want to be churlish. But really what we have just witnessed is a giant chasing-around exercise which has ended up more or less at the point where we started. At the heart of the argument is the fundamental concern that we voiced last year during the passage of the Bill, which is that to devolve the purchasing of high-cost, low-volume treatments to PCTs is to devolve down to the wrong level in the system. PCTs suffer from something that they cannot help. Most of them will have no in-house expertise for commissioning this type of service. That expertise was thinly spread in the first place when we had regional health authorities, but it will be even more thinly spread now, and much of it would have been dispersed altogether if the RSCGs had been allowed to disappear.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para86"></a>It is also felt by many that small PCT consortia are not good mechanisms for encouraging innovation into the NHS and for driving forward those innovations in a timely way. To do that, one needs some kind of central mechanism to operate across a broader base&#151;not, I hasten to say, a central means of control but rather some way of overseeing and guiding commissioners and facilitating improvements.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para87"></a>A considerable weight of opinion in the response to the consultation favoured a national group, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, consisting of representatives from the various commissioning consortia, whose job it would be to take a bird's eye view of specialised services across the country and to play a role as a facilitator in introducing and monitoring them. The guidance is silent on that idea, but perhaps I could ask the Minister whether she could be a little more forthcoming on it.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para88"></a>In that general context, I have a query about strategic health authorities. When it comes to making a new investment through either of the two tiers of commissioning consortia, I am not quite clear what role SHAs will have in the decision-making process. Will they be able to influence or second-guess decisions taken by the collaborative commissioning groups and, if so, in what way?
<P>

<P>

<a name="30408-20_para89"></a>The consultation also threw up the real worry that at PCT level some specialised services will be squeezed out in the annual budgeting process. A PCT board, faced with cost pressures as all boards are, could decide that low-cost, high-volume services were a greater priority for them than signing up for a slice of a service level agreement of which only a small handful of their patients might in the end avail themselves.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para90"></a>Some PCTs might decline to join a consortium altogether. There are already examples of that happening around the country. A prime example is enzyme replacement therapy in Croydon PCT. Another is renal services in London. Two years ago, there was agreement in the RSCG that a fourth renal transplant surgeon should be funded in south-west London at a cost of &pound;340,000. That money would be contributed by the PCTs in each of the five London sectors, plus Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley. But what has happened? We find that the PCTs in four of the five London sectors have refused to put any money on the table, and that could put the proposal at risk.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para91"></a>So, again, it was a huge relief to find in the guidance that the Government have woken up to that damaging possibility. Henceforward, it appears that all PCTs will be required to join collaborative commissioning groups and that the decisions of those groups will be binding on all members. It would, however, be very helpful if the Minister could make clear exactly what degree of compulsion is involved here. The guidance seems to be worded in a way that could be interpreted as being precisely that&#151;in other words, guidance rather than anything stronger. If a PCT refuses to contribute to a particular service which other members of the collaborative group are funding, what action can be taken? Are there sanctions against that PCT which can be enforced?
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para92"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the unanswered questions in the guidance. That is certainly one. I agree with him completely on his observation. But, in particular, I believe that there was a lack of clarity about the interface between the commissioning consortia and managed clinical networks. The guidance states that the collaborative commissioning groups will ensure&#151;that is the word used&#151;support for managed clinical networks without explaining how or through what governance mechanisms that support will be forthcoming. Managed clinical networks cover cancer and renal dialysis and transplant, among other services, and are extremely important. Clinical and managerial accountability is essential for those services. The example in the appendix to the guidance of NorCom states that it will monitor and support managed clinical networks. One has to ask how quality standards can be guaranteed if this model is not followed.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para93"></a>What is needed, of course, in the procurement of specialised services are two things: stability and certainty. But if there is no guaranteed, committed funding by PCTs for a service, we shall have the very opposite of that. There must be a way of achieving <P>


<a name="column_208"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>100 per cent involvement and compliance among PCTs. The obvious means of doing that is to have a levy, rather as the NorCom model does in the appendix to the guidance. Is that what the Government envisage and, if so, why is it not mentioned explicitly in the body of the guidance? For the year just beginning, it may be rather late in the day to ensure that the funding of some services is safeguarded in real terms, especially where service agreements have run out. It would be helpful to know whether the department is examining ways of addressing that.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para94"></a>But there is, in any case, an in-built tension here. Priorities are never set in stone; they change over time. Deciding on priorities depends on a number of things. To start with, there must be input from patients and the public. Only with that voice from outside is there likely to be an objective view about what services are needed where. Secondly, there must be some clinical input to ensure that proposals emanating from providers of services can be evaluated properly. I do not know how either of those will be achieved, and perhaps the Minister could make that clear in her reply.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para95"></a>The third ingredient in setting priorities is surely the freedom to move commissioning money from one provider to another. I have a particular worry here in relation to foundation trusts. Specialist providers which become foundation trusts in the future will depend on the income they receive from commissioning consortia in order to service their capital commitments. We understand that those service agreements will be legally binding. I should be very glad to hear from the Minister how this apparent rigidity in the way that funding is to be directed is consistent with the need to switch money between different services in response to changing priorities.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para96"></a>Notwithstanding the publication of the guidance, we should not delude ourselves that some areas of specialised commissioning are in anything other than a precarious state. In a number of regions, the commissioning consortia have barely got off the ground. Dermatology, foetal medicine, epilepsy surgery, rheumatology and specialised women's health services have very low coverage and can be seen only as being at risk. Cleft lip and palate, neonatal care and spinal injury services have very patchy provision. Those gaps must be addressed.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para97"></a>The government guidance, although late, is welcome. We shall need to continue digesting its implications. There are still many unresolved and serious concerns about access to services. It is helpful that the Minister now has an opportunity to shed a little light on some of the darker corners.

<A NAME="30408-20_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for giving us an opportunity to discuss what everyone who has spoken this evening agrees is an extremely important issue. I am particularly grateful to noble Lords who spoke with such affection, as well as respect, about my noble <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend Lord Hunt. I certainly echo everything that has been said. I myself miss him very much at this moment. I am shuffling my papers in a desperate attempt to introduce some coherence into my thoughts. I am sure that he would not have had that problem.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para98"></a>I hope that this is an opportunity for me to do the job that I believe noble Lords would like me to do&#151;that is, to provide clarification and reassurance on a number of the points raised about the sensitive and complex issue of commissioning specialist services. Those services go to the most vulnerable because they are rare disorders, they affect a relatively small number of people and they are provided in centres which are often far from home.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para99"></a>In the time I have, I shall do my best to answer the detailed questions that were raised&#151;I am sure that I shall not be able to answer all of them; but I shall certainly write to noble Lords about those that I cannot&#151;through my general survey of what the guidance is intended to do. Briefly, I shall consider what has been inherited; the review itself; the responses to the review; and what we want the guidance to achieve. We all agree that commissioning special services so that they meet the span of needs in the local community while balancing that against the routine and daily requirements of local health needs is a skill. It requires judgment, expertise and foresight, as well as careful planning.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para100"></a>Specialist services fall into two groupings related to the size of population. Traditionally, planning populations of 3 to 6 million have traditionally been provided for by the regional specialist commissioning groups, each of which established a tier below it that covers populations the same or of a similar size to that of a strategic health authority&#151;1 to 2 million. For the transitional period, those services have been maintained.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para101"></a>So specialist services are part of the continuum of care that stretches from primary to tertiary services, and they are increasingly managed as part of the clinical network. Until the creation of the PCTs in April 2002, the RSCGs indeed drew their membership from health authorities, as did local groups, and those arrangements generated many advantages by basing collaborative commissioning arrangements on planning&#151;and nurtured existing and emergent managed networks. For example, by encouraging a lead commissioner acting on behalf of everyone they supported the establishment of coherent commissioning and minimised transaction costs. By promoting collaboration, it was possible to pool financial risk.
<P>

<a name="30408-20_para102"></a>Those are strengths that the Government wanted to ensure were continued in the new commissioning arrangements that have been in place since April 2002. Indeed, the review last summer allowed the opportunity to reveal how they were working. Noble Lords have been rather unkind about that review, suggesting that it represented a loss of confidence in some way. Perhaps not. It was an opportunity to take stock of what was developing in the field during the transitional year and to ensure that people knew what were positive outcomes and developments that could be introduced.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30408-20_para103"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, the Government listened closely to what was said. There was a large response and a large degree of consensus. That was broad-based and the guidance that has been produced is also broad, but specific enough to be extremely useful. It is broad because the whole principle of devolving NHS commissioning to primary care trusts by definition means that those decisions are best taken&#151;as are commissioning decisions as a whole&#151;in the local area where the NHS knows its patients, their needs and how and where to provide them.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but does she really believe that the current guidelines represent the consensus established during the consultation? As many of us read it, the consultation requested a much greater degree of upward devolution, if you like, from the PCTs on a firmer and more compulsory basis than is currently the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord allows me to develop my argument, I think that I can satisfy him. The guidance does follow the spirit of the consultation, especially in relation to the development of regional specialist community groups. Essentially, the guidance ends the uncertainty of commissioning arrangements&#151;as the noble Earl said, it is extremely important to build certainty into the commissioning arrangements, alongside clear thinking.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para0"></a>From the responses to the report, it was especially clear that the work of the regional specialist commissioning groups was highly valued, but that they were still developing organisations. That accorded with the Government's view of the continuing importance of maintaining strategic responsibility at that level. So let me emphasise, as does the guidance, that where such regional and local specialised commissioning groups and arrangements are working effectively in line with the guidance, there is no need to change them.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para1"></a>To address the specific question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who cited my honourable friend Hazel Blears in another place as saying that the RSCGs would continue only, by implication, for another year, when she spoke, she meant 2002&#150;03; she was not talking about the future. So I can certainly put the noble Lord's mind to rest on that point.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para2"></a>I hope that I can also reassure him on another matter. As the Government believe that planning must take place at the appropriate level, and given the population for which the regional groups have always been responsible and their success as developing strategic bodies, their work and the response that we have received&#151;we are certainly considering developing regional specialist commissioning groups in future. There is a definite continuing role for them.
<P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para3"></a>To continue my argument about regional commissioning for a moment, the guidance places an explicit value on the continuity of commissioning and strategic development at regional level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, this is too good an opportunity to miss to probe further. Who decides whether those arrangements are working sufficiently effectively for the RSCGs to continue? It is so qualified in the guidance that they are to carry on, but only where they are working effectively. Who decides on that? That will mean that there is a patchy network.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, again, to continue with my argument, the guidance will guide the RSCGs. We are asking them to build on their experience and knowledge of specialist services; to develop their capacity; and, concerning the guidance's advice on the nature of commissioning, to put in place the clear strategic process that will guarantee that commissioning is working at regional and local level.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para4"></a>To turn to my second point, the guidance essentially aims to ensure that all RSCGs and local commissioning groups meet the level of the best. We want them to put in place agreed remits and powers, clear accountability and public and patient involvement that can be approved by the strategic health authority, so that the relationship between the collaborative tiers is clear and appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para5"></a>We have made clear that what we mean by the proper functioning of commissioning groups is that there is a clear and agreed structure that enables them to develop clear referral guidelines, access criteria and treatment protocols; and to follow the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines, appropriate data-monitoring, clinical and financial risk-assessment procedures and service-specific commissioning consortia.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para6"></a>Those are the pillars of good practice. They are spelled out in the guidance and CCGs that follow the guidance will be well on their way to intelligent and successful commissioning. We envisage the regional groups as fulfilling an extremely important role&#151;as they have&#151;and developing that role in future.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para7"></a>I turn to some questions that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asked about the role of PCTs. He and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked whether their decisions were binding and, if so, what the nature of that binding arrangement. We expect that the remit, the powers and the rules of engagement will be agreed by the member PCTs. It is up to them to decide the nature of the binding agreement that they will enter into. There will be scope for development. We are agreed that the decisions taken are binding on all PCT members and that the commissioning process is transparent, so that providers and the public are clear who is commissioning. There is a clear direction for the PCTs to engage seriously with the process of commissioning.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para8"></a>Noble Lords have asked what is the role of the SHA. It is up to the SHA to ensure that that takes place. The SHAs have the oversight of PCTs. They will have the <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility for ensuring that the guidance in the respect that I am describing is followed. It is a developing arrangement and a developing reform. We have provided additional and clear signposts for the standard of performance that we expect, and how PCTs can avoid the risks that have been identified. For example, we want to see a dedicated commissioning team in every PCT. They have already demonstrated their value. We want to put the PCTs in the driving seat. We have emphasised the need for coherence and integration in the overall approach. We have asked the PCTs to incorporate plans for specialised services in their future local delivery plans. Those plans are at present being evaluated by the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para9"></a>We have linked commissioning into education and training for specialist services, so that workforce confederations are including considerations in their work programmes. We have emphasised the need to build local and public confidence through a transparent process, so that PCTs are expected to make public the remit and rules of engagement. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, talked about the importance of the involvement of the users of the service. Indeed they will be involved. PCTs should ensure that their views and experience are fed into the commissioning process, and that certainly involves the user groups, who have the greatest experience.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para10"></a>Noble Lords have raised the issue of capacity. I must stress that PCTs have already been in place for a year. They are still developing systems. They are developing their expertise, but they are developing a history of continuity in workforce and practice that I hope will reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who raised that question. The evidence that we have suggests that after a year they are developing the systems to deliver local services. There is a growing understanding of their roles and the size of the agenda. We have no evidence to date of the PCTs failing to commission properly, and now they have the guarantee of more certainty, because they have three-year allocations so that they can plan more effectively. We believe that the capacity will be built through mature collaborative behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para11"></a>That is not all. We are providing support around the PCTs, and that may address the noble Earl's question about why we have not supported the idea of a national group. We have a support system which includes the training and support programmes offered through the national primary care trusts. They are finalising a self-assessment tool for commissioning competencies. That will include specialised services. There is the overall responsibility which the SHAs hold for performance. That is the key to successful arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para12"></a>The commissioning process is underpinned by the national frameworks, which guide best practice and treatment in areas such as CHD and diabetes, which cross over with specialist services. NICE gives clear guidelines on prescriptions.
<P>


<a name="column_213"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para13"></a>We have built certainties and reassurances into the system. The PCTs will have already developed the competence in line with successful commissioning arrangements, which will continue and will be aided by the guidance.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para14"></a>I shall briefly answer a few of the questions that other noble Lords have raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked about spinal units. It is extremely important that people with spinal injuries are able to access spinal units, for all the reasons that she mentioned, particularly the issue of pressure sores and so on. A new review into spinal services is being conducted by three RSCGs in the south of England, including Stoke Mandeville hospital. It will look at provision and performance of services in relation to commissioning and spinal units. A report will be finished by May to be presented at a conference. We hope that generalised good practice will come out of that, which others can access and develop. That is good news.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chan, referred to the fact that black and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from some forms of disease. We are very conscious of that. We have addressed the genetics issue in different ways. We expect the Green Paper on genetics very soon. A specialist committee of commissioners has been addressing genetic issues. We issued detailed guidance on sickle cell some time ago and we hope that universal neonatal screening for every child will be <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>available within the next three years. In different ways, we are looking at the issues that seem particularly to disadvantage black and ethnic minority families.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para16"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked about young people in childcare homes in particular. One issue that they particularly have to contend with is mental health services. RSCGs have a particular responsibility to address issues of mental health of children. In addition, a lot of support is coming through Quality Protects and the new child and mental health services with additional funding, which makes it essential that people who look after children are aware of the need to take advantage of what is coming their way. That is why training is very important and why the voice of the child and the staff in the PCT commissioning process is particularly important. We should certainly look out for that.
<P>

<a name="30408-21_para17"></a>I have gone well beyond my time and I am conscious that I have not addressed many of the detailed questions that have been raised. I am very sorry that I have not been able to deal with them. I shall have to write to noble Lords and pick up the points of detail. I hope that the guidance will be welcomed and supported across the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 92:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 42, line 15, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-22_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) The Secretary of State shall define water poverty as those households spending over three per cent of their income on water charges."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-22_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am particularly pleased to open this sitting by moving this amendment because it lays the ground for much of our discussions on the rest of the Bill. It requires the Secretary of State to come up with a definition of water poverty, and it suggests what that definition should be. In framing that definition, I pay tribute to the work of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which produced a good study, Water Poverty in England. That thorough study came up with a couple of modest recommendations, the first of which is that the Government should give consideration to setting 3 per cent of net income as the level above which it is unreasonable to expect a household to meet water charges. The second recommendation is that the water regulator should investigate the extent to which water poverty contributes to water debt.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para4"></a>I tabled the amendment because I believe that without a definition of what constitutes water poverty, it is hard to decide who is in water poverty. I do not believe that the regulations in the Bill do anything to reduce the number of households affected by water poverty or to help the industry in relation to the ever-increasing problem of water debt. We now rightly have a regime that does not allow people to be disconnected from the water supply if they fall into debt. That should remain. Once that arrangement is in place, one needs to be aware of who cannot pay their water bills and who will not pay their water bills. We will discuss water debt later today.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para5"></a>The amendment frames the issue in such a way that it begins to address something that has not been addressed by the Government to date. When the Minister replies, he may say that the Government's arrangement involving vulnerable groupings of people who may apply for help with their water bill answers the problem. However, I believe that there are some 4 million people in that vulnerable group, which <P>


<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>includes the elderly&#151;who may also be incontinent&#151;those with severe illness problems and those with large families who may find it harder to be in full-time work&#151;that is certainly true in relation to both parents. They are often people with multiple problems. The vulnerable groups provisions fail on two counts: first, the provisions made under them are taken up by only 1 per cent of those who are eligible, which is a really pathetic rate for benefit take-up; and, secondly, the concept that lies behind the approach is somewhat Victorian, in the sense that it involves a charitable assumption, which is run&#151;for good reasons&#151;by the industry in a way that assumes that other water consumers will pay for those who cannot pay.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para6"></a>I hope that the amendment will start the Government's thinking about defining water poverty and help them to decide that the current position is not satisfactory. I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment as the first stage of addressing the problems of those who cannot afford their water bill and of the industry, for which the debt problem is substantial. The industry needs to know, if it is to deliver all that we expect of it&#151;including environmental goods and so on in the Bill&#151;that the people who cannot pay will be properly helped. That help should be provided on the same basis as that for other benefit help, not as a throwback to Victorian charities. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Whether it is necessary to have the amendment in the Bill, I understand the reasons why the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, moved it.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para7"></a>I have some questions for the noble Baroness, or for the Minister. First, is the criterion requested in this regard carried through in relation to any other utility Bills? Secondly, the noble Baroness said that 1 per cent of benefits were taken up, but 1 per cent of how many? Thirdly, in recent times, the water companies themselves have tried to address the whole question of debt and debt repayments. To a certain extent, they have been very successful at it. I am not associated with any water company at all and therefore have no insight in this regard. If they have been successful and no one has genuinely been put at risk who would otherwise have been helped by their strides to address the debt situation, one would have to question whether writing something into the Bill would detract from their ability to try to bring debtors into line and encourage them to pay something. I believe that there has been a lengthening of the time in which one can pay or spread the load.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para8"></a>Those are indirect questions. I understand why the noble Baroness made her remarks in this context. All of us are concerned about poverty. Those three questions need addressing. I should be grateful if that were done by the Minister when he winds up or by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, when she responds to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I assume that the concept that the noble Baroness is proposing is the equivalent concept of fuel <P>


<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>poverty, which is defined as 10 per cent of net income. However, that has various legislative strategy and scheme implications and the provision of various services are related to it. However, the approach in the amendment is entirely in isolation and is not followed through with amendments anywhere else in the Bill, so far as I can see, and would have no legal effect because it offers a definition that is not contained in any other legislation. I therefore believe that the effects are not clear.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para9"></a>There is obviously an issue in this regard but, as the noble Baroness said, we have already taken action to stop household water disconnection and in terms of protecting vulnerable groups, who would otherwise cut back on water that they could not afford, with meters. We also have the current consultation on extending the protection for vulnerable households. The Government are addressing the problems of water poverty but the definition does not appear to help or to be clearly based in fact on the people who may be affected by the costs or the difficulties of providing water. The fact that the amendment would not have any effect means that I am not sure that it is the best way, beyond pure symbolism, to deliver anything for those who are genuinely in poverty, partly because of their water costs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I am slightly surprised by the Minister's lack of enthusiasm for the amendment. I had hoped that he would say that he agreed with the spirit of the amendment. There is not a great deal of carry-through to frame it so that it could take effect in relation to the rest of the Bill. At this stage I had hoped to discover the Government's attitude to the issue.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para10"></a>The fact that water is at the end of the debt list&#151; which is of itself a reason for my amendment being worthy of more consideration than the Minister appears to give it&#151;says nothing for the value of water. If the Government are concerned about creating a fair society&#151;which I believe they are&#151;then the people most in need of help with their water bills should be entitled to it. The failure to define &quot;water poverty" does not help.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para11"></a>I have tables that answer the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in regard to the kinds of people who apply and the numbers who are successful. Rather than read them out at length, I shall pass her a copy.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para12"></a>It is difficult to deal with a problem until it is clearly defined. If we cannot define the substance of water poverty it will be very difficult to find a mechanism for dealing with water debt in a way that does not badly affect people. Having brought in legislation to stop disconnections there was then a failure to address the issue of the rising debt problem. Although I accept that expanding the amendment would require a new clause in the Bill, it is worthy of somewhat more enthusiasm.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para13"></a>The noble Baroness asked a third question which I have not answered. I cannot remember what it was. Perhaps she will help me.

<A NAME="30408-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The noble Baroness said that 1 per cent of benefit take-up was referred to in the report. My question was, &quot;1 per cent of how many people?" I want to establish how many households were affected. It could be 1 per cent of 10 or of 10,000. Obviously there could be quite a difference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-22_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   According to the report, some 4 million may fall within the category of water poverty. So it would be 1 per cent of 4 million.
<P>

<a name="30408-22_para14"></a>As regards the Minister's question about whether this is the equivalent of fuel poverty, I do not believe that it is. Provisions for not disconnecting people from their water supplies are already in place, whereas if they could not afford heating they would stay cold. It is not equivalent but it is no less important for a different reason. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-23_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30408-23_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 92A concerns special interest groups. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, spoke on the subject at length in our previous discussions. We would prefer to have all groups included or none included. Having listened to what the noble Lord said last week, we consider that none should be included. I hope that I have spoken to the right amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Tordoff): </B>  I should inform the Committee that, were the amendment to be accepted, I would not be able to call Amendment No. 93 because of pre-emption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I notice that Amendment No. 92A is grouped with Amendments Nos. 98A and 116A. I apologise to the Committee; my head is not quite as it should be. I shall now speak to those amendments.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para2"></a>Amendment No. 98A deals with a small grammatical point. We believe that the word &quot;consumers" includes both existing and future consumers&#151;a point we debated last week&#151;and that the term &quot;future consumers" has no place on the face of the Bill. The argument that I advanced in connection with Amendment No. 92A applies equally to Amendment No. 116A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Going back slightly, if we were to define clearly people in water poverty we could simplify this part of the Bill for those who have difficulty paying their water bills. To that extent, I support the amendment. It is certainly not true that all those of pensionable age, for example, would need any special provisions. They often fall into the better-off categories of society. I press the Minister again on whether the Government are clear about people who are unable to pay their water bills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I feel somewhat ambivalent to this group of amendments. I did not speak to the previous <P>


<a name="column_GC5"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment because I was a little puzzled as to what it was for. It is of interest because, obviously, the whole issue of people who cannot pay because of low income is important. As the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, indicated, water companies have had to cope with this problem in recent years as they have been disallowed from disconnecting.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para3"></a>All of us, no doubt, are very much against the notion of disconnecting people who are poor&#151;the &quot;can't pays" rather than the &quot;won't pays". None the less, I hope that Members of the Committee will recognise that the ultimate threat of disconnection was of some value&#151;at any rate so far as concerned the &quot;won't pays"&#151;because eventually one got a payment. Water companies are now faced with the problem that there is no ultimate sanction because, for sheer humanitarian reasons, everyone has to be supplied with water. Very often the ones who cannot pay are in most need&#151;the single-parent families, the substantial families&#151;and for them it would be a disaster on a Baghdad scale if supplies were not maintained.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para4"></a>This is a very important matter. It is right that individuals with low incomes should be of special concern to the Secretary of State or the authority, as the case may be. The previous amendment might have defined people on low incomes and have been of some value to that extent, but otherwise it was&#151;I suggest rather rudely to the noble Baroness&#151;a little academic.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para5"></a>As to the list as a whole, it seems perfectly reasonable to pick out each of the other groups. However, as I suggested last time, I am not sure why individuals residing in rural areas should be picked rather than those living in urban areas, some of whom include the poorest in the country. Why should one pick one group rather than the other?
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para6"></a>The trouble with picking such a group, as I suggested on a previous occasion, is that that encourages the Opposition to add to the list. Last time&#151;I am glad that we have put this behind us now&#151;students in full-time education were deemed to be a separate and proper group to pick out. That is the trouble with a list of this kind. At the end of the existing new subsection (2C) it says that this little list,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xis not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of consumer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-23_para7"></a>
One wonders what the point of it is. No doubt the Minister will explain. At the moment I am ambivalent as to its purpose and unsure whether it should be retained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I feel that this part of the clause clouds the issue. The issue of water debt is, as we have discussed many times, twofold: there are the &quot;can't pay" and the &quot;won't pay". Some of the &quot;can't pay" people attempt to pay because they have pride and do not want to have bills hanging over them, whereas some people who &quot;won't pay" are as wealthy as anyone here and they think, &quot;There is no sanction so we can get away with it".
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para8"></a>I do not think that this amendment tackles either of those categories; it certainly does not tackle the second category. But there must be ways. I speak as a director <P>


<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of water companies that have not been involved in the minutiae of this, but I know that there has been an attempt to get water companies, through an organisation of water companies, to come to a solution of this major problem of indebtedness. I would prefer to see such a list done away with, and a commitment put on the face of the Bill for the Government to do everything possible to try to reduce the level of indebtedness of the water companies that has increased by 10 per cent since the sanction of disconnection was introduced. We shall come to further amendments later.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para9"></a>The emphasis in this set of amendments is on those who &quot;can't pay"&#151;not those on this list but those who have a real problem. There should be some way of dealing with that through the benefit system, which deals with matters such as mortgage repayments. There are also supplementary benefits for various things and I cannot see why water cannot be included in that. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has stated, there is a list provided by the citizens advice bureaux which advises those who are in straitened financial circumstances to pay off their debts in a descending order of importance. I think water comes about fifth, after such matters as payments for clothes, catalogue buying and satellite television subscriptions. It is a big issue but I am not necessarily sure that the amendments&#151;particularly this one&#151;deal with it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Likewise I am not sure that these amendments address the problems referred to. It is possible to be completely purist, as my noble friend Lord Borrie was urging us on this amendment, and to delete all reference to any individuals. Were the Bill to be in that form before the Committee I am sure that amendments from the Opposition to pay particular attention, for example, to pensioners, the disabled or those in rural areas would undoubtedly have arisen. Where one draws the line is a matter of judgment. A complete deletion of those would imply that there has to be equality of treatment for all groups.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para10"></a>I think it is right that the attention of the authorities should be drawn to these categories: the disabled, the elderly, those on low incomes and those in rural areas. That is right in this context as it is in other contexts. Therefore, to some extent it is a matter of taste, but it must be the case that to operate effectively the authorities would have to pay attention to those groups.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para11"></a>I do not like Amendment No. 98A at all. As my noble friend Lord Borrie mentioned on the previous occasion, the reference to future consumers is a way of getting the authorities to focus on the long-term interests of consumers as well as on the short-term interests of consumers. Therefore, to delete the list would not be helpful. Amendment No. 116A is effectively covered by those comments in relation to Amendment No. 92A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   If 4.4 million households in England and Wales were in debt at the end of the financial year 2001&#151;that is the last year for which I have figures&#151;that is 19 per cent of households. <P>


<a name="column_GC7"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I understand that the Minister does not like this amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, or my previous amendment, but if the amount of household water debt is that high, what do the Government intend to do to remedy the situation? If they will not accept any of our amendments, do they intend to bring forward something of their own?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have discussed these issues with the companies, and we shall continue to do so. Dealing with household debt and dealing with the distribution of household debt is not really something that can be dealt with in the legislative arena. It certainly is not something that can be dealt with by these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-23_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. I have three questions for the Minister. First, on the amendment that seeks to delete all those in the list, are specific groups named on the face of other utility Bills? Secondly, I understand that the thrust behind the Minister's response to Amendment No. 98A is that he wants to give encouragement to future consumers. There is no difference between us on that; we just do not think that it is necessary on the face of the Bill, hence the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30408-23_para12"></a>Thirdly, surely all those groups of people laid down in the Bill, except perhaps those living in rural areas&#151;it would not necessarily be true of them&#151;would fall directly within the benefit system. If they fall within the benefit system, because they are low income families or are recognised as having problems, surely the benefit system would make it unnecessary to specify them separately in the Bill. With regard to the pensioner category who live in rural areas&#151;I say to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that I am not making an appeal on our own behalf&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the Sitting was suspended, I put three questions to the Minister. Provided that he is happy that he has understood them, I am happy to await his response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The response is normally given by the mover of the amendment, but I shall attempt to answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Perhaps the Minister will forgive me. I thought that I had asked three questions to which he had not responded when the Division Bell sounded. I assumed that he would answer those before I did so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   One of the questions related to provisions in other legislation. The provision in the Utilities Act 2000 is virtually the same&#151;apart from the last group; namely,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xcustomers . . . whose premises are not eligible to be supplied by a licensed water supplier".

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para2"></a>On the issue of the inter-relationship of those groups and those in debt, as I said, we have been in discussion with the water companies. One of the reasons why this matter is not easy to deal with in legislation is that the pattern of debt is very different for each water company. Therefore, we are conducting some research and discussion with the companies about how to deal with that.
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para3"></a>Although much of the focus of the discussion has been on debt, these groups are not designated only because they are the most likely to fall into debt&#151;some are not in debt. Disabled consumers, for example, have special service needs; rural consumers have connection and distance problems, and probably service problems as well. So it is not primarily for reasons of debt that these groups are listed here, although the issue is relevant. I believe that I have dealt, at least in part, with the three questions put by the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   What else would the reason be, if not debt? The provision of water is automatic&#151;water is water, is water, which is provided. Looking at the clause again, I cannot quite understand the Minister's point. The words are:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe Authority shall have regard to the interests of".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-24_para4"></a>
Surely those interests relate to paying for water rather than to anything else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Yes, but the questions of connection, of how much is paid for the services and of how the service charges are raised&#151;and, therefore, the amount of money required from consumers&#151;are not necessarily related to the propensity of those consumers to get into debt. They relate to the totality of the charging system and to the way in which the service providers operate, to make sure that they do not discriminate against these groups.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Are there not effectively two categories? There are those who are presently classed as &quot;vulnerable groups", and those who have to spend more than 3 per cent of their income on their water bills. Those are the two relevant groups.
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para5"></a>I cannot quite understand why &quot;individuals of pensionable age" in paragraph (b)&#151;I do not quite have to declare an interest yet!&#151;should be in a special category unless they have difficulty paying their bills; otherwise, why is there no category for those who are perfectly well off?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the Minister responds, perhaps I may ask him to clarify the point I raised with regard to those who are considered to be struggling to pay their bills. My question before the Sitting was suspended related to the fact that most of those people will be on some form of benefit; therefore, their needs will be covered by the benefits system. The Minister did not address that point in his reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Their income may be supplemented by the benefits system for certain services, but problems caused by the water companies may not be covered. The benefits system helps families which meet certain terms. But a family with a certain number of children <P>


<a name="column_GC9"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or with a certain degree of disability may be in a different situation from another family as far as concerns its water requirements and the way in which the water companies supply the water. You cannot rely on the benefits system to remove the requirement for the authorities to pay attention to these groups.
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para6"></a>Pensioners often have difficulties in meeting bills, in making complaints and in accessing the service companies. It seems sensible to include pensioners in the Bill, as is the case for other utilities. Not all pensioners, rural dwellers and people on low incomes will be vulnerable in relation to water. Clearly there is an overlap in the provisions, as there is in regard to fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para7"></a>It is important to stress that although the alleviation of fuel poverty as an objective is contained in government statements and government legislation, a definition of fuel poverty is not required by the legislation. Equally, we do not define water in the Bill in the way suggested by the noble Baroness in the previous amendment. But we do designate those groups to which authorities, councils and so on have to pay attention in relation to various aspects of their work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-24_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No 94 seeks an explanation of why the multiple powers and duties at the beginning of new subsection (2E) become singular at the end of the subsection. Do the Government envisage that any of the interests mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) will have an impact only upon a single duty mentioned in subsection (1)? I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify the point. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   When the Secretary of State or the authority exercise powers or perform duties under this section they may have regard to certain interests affected by that power or that duty. To amend it to the plural would imply something entirely different. It could imply that when the Secretary of State or the authority exercise any of the powers or perform any of the duties under Section 2(1) of the Water Industry Act, they may have regard to interests affected by any of the other powers or duties. That clearly would be wrong. It is only when exercising one of those powers that they have to deal with the people affected by that power.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-24_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 95, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 99. The amendments relate to two important issues. Amendment No. 95 concerns the long-term interests of consumers. We discussed in earlier debates the cost of long-term maintenance. Proposed new subsection (2F)(b) and (c) speaks for itself in that regard. Paragraph (d) is particularly important as it requires that the methodology adopted by the commission should apply to all appointed companies. The amendment seeks to clarify the situation. I understand that the Enterprise Bill removes possible political influence. Once agreed, methodology is established.
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para15"></a>Amendment No. 99 deals with the same issue and seeks reasonableness and proportionality. Proposed new subsection (1A) states:

<P>
<A NAME="30408-24_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I thank my noble friend for introducing the amendment, to which I have attached my name. The background behind the amendment is that, in determining the prices to be charged, a methodology is given to all companies by which they produce their final figures. The amendment requires that the methodology should be agreed by the authorities and all the companies before they go on to do the &quot;number crunching".
<P>

<a name="30408-24_para17"></a>The appeal process should apply not only to companies which have appealed against the methodology but to all companies. That is very important. Otherwise the same situation will arise as the last time there were appeals from the water companies to Ofwat, when some companies were involved but it was not a general appeal. If an appeal is made and a condition is agreed through the appeals process, particularly in regard to the methodology, it should apply to all companies and there should be no further appeal.

There probably needs to be a hierarchy of interest of consumers, infrastructure, and so forth, that is clearly understood. I know that the pricing mechanism and the water authorities' duties include that. But as the Bill seems to go into great detail on some of these points, spelling out that hierarchy would be helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In relation to this particular discussion, the reference to &quot;reasonable return" in paragraph (c) is part of a sentence which refers to the proper carrying out of those functions. Therefore, it is fairly much as the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, indicated. As regards hierarchy of objectives, the problem with Amendment No. 95&#151;with which I have some sympathy&#151;is that it appears to give primacy to the long term and to long-term investment over other provisions. Clearly, in some circumstances, the regulator would have to pay attention to the short-term impact. An immediate and draconian price rise, for example, could be something to which the regulator would have to pay attention, while also giving consideration overall to the longer term. It could override, in terms of its effect on the consumer, the long-term position.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para0"></a>This clause is fairly inoperable; it does not indicate the period of long term to which it refers. Of course, throughout the regulatory structure we will have periodic reviews. That could imply that there would always be a trade-off of the long term against the short term, whereas clearly the regulator and the other authorities would need to have a balanced approach.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para1"></a>The Secretary of State issued guidance to Ofwat earlier this year stating that,
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-25_para2"></a>
That general guidance stands and achieves the objectives that the slightly difficult formulation in the amendment might not.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para3"></a>Amendment No. 99 concerns the question of the financial costs that might be imposed on water companies and their customers. I support the aim that the costs and benefits of any guidance issued under this clause must be assessed and properly considered. The <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Government are committed in this and in other contexts to producing regulatory impact assessments for that reason. In addition, in the impact assessment which accompanied this Bill, the Government said that where there might be significant financial implications, they should be taken forward by means of new legal provision.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para4"></a>I do not think that the way in which Amendment No. 99 is directed to undertakers' and consumers' costs is appropriate. However, I am prepared to take Amendment No. 99 away and try to come back with something more appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his last comment on Amendment No. 99. As he knows, it is difficult to propose amendments that fit, that are relevant and with which the Government may have sympathy, even though the wording is perhaps not quite right or unacceptable. I thank the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para5"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 95, the Minister said that it might put in jeopardy a short-term need that needs addressing if we look too much at the long term. I should like to take this issue away and perhaps return to it at a later stage. I accept that the general guidance given to Ofwat is in being. But the amendment, particularly as regards methodology and the duty to publish it, has not been addressed. Therefore, we may need to look at this again.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para6"></a>I believe that these amendments would help the Bill. A two-stage approach helps to ensure that the price  review process is more transparent and predictable to characteristics of good regulation. Price determinations are undertaken on the basis of published and agreed methodologies. I thought that that was something which the Government would support. We believe a two-stage approach achieves early resolution to disputes on methodology and policy. It has the potential that lengthy and costly appeals could be reduced. Therefore, it would be of benefit to customers who currently have to bear the full costs of appeals to the Competition Commission.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para7"></a>In the mean time, the Minister has said that he will look again at Amendment No. 99. He might also have a look at Amendment No. 95. I am not tying him to a commitment to do that as he has not given any indication of doing that. We are trying to ensure that all determinations are common to all companies. It seems much more logical to go down that line than perhaps to have different concepts for different companies in different areas. If the Government want to go down that latter course&#151;a bad pun; another pound in the Water Aid bucket&#151;I think that that and the implications that it might have on individual water companies should be made clearer. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 95.

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Water Industry Act. Suddenly, in sub-paragraph (iii), there is a reference to &quot;the person" who is the licensed water supplier. The Secretary of State or the authority is to ensure that this person's licence does not authorise it to carry on any activities in the area of &quot;the company". Frankly, I am unsure what the Government intend by this provision and would appreciate clarification from the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para11"></a>In speaking to Amendment No. 96, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 100, which is linked to it. Under new Section 2A, the Secretary of State may issue guidance to the authority concerning its contribution towards the attainment of any social or environmental policies. We welcome this provision, particularly the requirement that the Secretary of State and the assembly consult the necessary stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para12"></a>I am also pleased that the draft guidance will be laid before Parliament, but I am unsure whether the guidance will have the same status as a statutory instrument subject to the negative procedure. It appears that there is the usual 40 days' time for consideration of content, during which either House can resolve that the guidance should not be issued. Does that mean that the draft guidance could be rejected or amended, if any Member wished to do so? Will the draft guidance be subject to a substantive debate in each House? I should appreciate some clarification on the parliamentary status of draft guidance. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30408-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Amendment No. 96 seeks to remove the prohibition on licensed water suppliers associated with an undertaker from operating in that particular undertaker's area. This provision is needed to ensure consumers are protected and to promote competition.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para13"></a>We expect undertakers to compete in their areas of appointment against licensees by offering better prices and services and operating at higher efficiencies. At the same time, we expect undertakers to create associated companies so that they can enter the competitive market in other parts of England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para14"></a>If these associated licensees were able to operate in their parent undertaker's area, the undertaker could find ways of encouraging customers to transfer to its associates in order to remove them from their regulated activities and the price control mechanism. This could be done only at the expense of the customers remaining with the regulated business.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para15"></a>The prohibition has also been put in place to ensure that when licensed water suppliers operate in an area they are competing with each other and the undertaker on a level playing field. I hope that I have given the explanation that the noble Duke sought.
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para16"></a>As has been said, Amendment No. 100 seeks to redefine the duration for which any draft social and environmental guidance must be laid before Parliament for approval from &quot;40 days" to &quot;40 working days".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-25_para17"></a>Although the social and environmental guidance is not a statutory instrument, the Bill replicates the negative procedure for parliamentary scrutiny, including the usual exclusions. The 40 days are therefore calendar days in exactly the same way. Forty working days would depart from the normal parliamentary procedure and would extend the time that the draft guidance has to lie before both Houses to beyond the time allowed for statutory instruments. We believe that that would not be appropriate. If a matter is raised, there could be a debate if the usual channels agree.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-26_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment seeks to probe the water industry's thinking on Water Framework Directive-related programmes, which may well require actions to be undertaken that the Government consider fall under the proposed new subsection (3)(e), which is introduced by subsection (4) of Clause 38,

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xto contribute to the achievement of sustainable development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-26_para3"></a>
I do not believe that the measure is specific enough. For example, would the planting of a forest in a river basin catchment be the kind of issue that the water industry would have regard to when carrying out its duties? My noble friend Lord Livsey will give further examples. Will the Minister explain to what extent the water industry must take the Water Framework Directive into account as, at this point in time, the directive is not included in the Bill? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I shall expand a little on what my noble friend has said, particularly in relation to the Water Framework Directive. Article 9 of the directive refers to the recovery of costs for water services. It states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XMember states shall take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental and resource costs, having regard to the economic analysis conducted according to Annex III".
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para7"></a>In proposing the amendment, my noble friend Lady Miller draws attention to the fact that Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive lays out its stall as regards the matter we are discussing. I refer to the statement that I have just read out. We should like to probe the Minister's thinking on the matter as it seems to me that what is laid out in the Water Framework Directive is eminently sensible when calculating pricing policies.
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para8"></a>It indicates clearly that the social dimension has to be taken into account and states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XMember States may in so doing have regard to the social, environmental and economic effects of the recovery as well as the geographic and climatic conditions of the region or regions affected".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-26_para9"></a>
Therefore, the social dimension should be taken into account in pricing policies. These are very important issues in relation to the Bill. The amendment seeks to probe the Minister's thinking on whether the Water Framework Directive needs to be integrated into the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford:  </B>  I do not want to comment further on what has been said but we come back to the same question and difficulty&#151;that is, that there are issues in the Water Framework Directive that cannot be included in the Bill. It puts us in a ridiculous situation and I wish to log my concern again. I understand why the noble Baroness has moved the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As the noble Lord said, the amendment would require the Secretary of State and the authority to have regard to the Water Framework Directive and its consequent programmes when taking pricing decisions. I do not think that anyone will argue with that. However, we do not need new legislation to do that as it is already in process.
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para10"></a>The directive requires us to have regard to certain principles in the recovery of costs, notably the polluter pays principle. As a result of the directive, we have set out in our consultation that the water charging system in this country already takes such matters into consideration without legislative change being required.
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para11"></a>We certainly recognise that the directive will require programmes of investment by water companies and others. A process for implementing the directive will identify exactly what needs to be done and the timetable. Once those programmes are defined as legal obligations on the companies under the directive, the Secretary of State and the authority will be under a duty to ensure that their financing carries through. At present that is a responsibility of Ofwat. There is already a very well established procedure&#151;the periodic review of water price limits&#151;under which Ofwat sets price limits relating to considerations now required by the directive. The obligation that companies must meet, and of which Ofwat must take account, will be clearly set out in guidance to the regulator. In January, as I said, we issued new guidance for the next periodic review. That set out how the Water Framework Directive should be treated for <P>


<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the purpose of price limits in 2005 under the existing process. It is too early to say what investment will be required. Under the provisions of the Water Framework Directive, the indications may be that most of the investment will be required beyond 2010 but some schemes may need funding between 2005 and 2010, in which case the Water Framework Directive schemes will be included in the guidance that will be issued under existing legislation. There is no need for any new legislation in this field. We have therefore not provided new powers in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I want to respond to the Minister on that. He clearly said that there is no need for that. The truth of the matter is that the Water Framework Directive will not be adopted until after we have passed the Bill; that is one of the arguments that we have had all along. It has huge implications. The Minister said that guidance was sent out to Ofwat earlier this year, if I understand him correctly&#151;I listened quite carefully, I trust. He also said that there will be clear guidance to come in the future but that it was too early to say as yet.
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para12"></a>We are being asked to take an awful lot of things on trust in the Bill in addition to giving the Government powers to do whatever, because we do not have any control over guidance. However, when we debate the Bill and primary legislation, we do have that. I again say that I find where we are unsatisfactory and will continue to say so throughout the Bill. The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say on the one hand that that is not necessary and, on the other hand, that we will clearly need to have guidance. Perhaps the Minister will comment on my comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The point is that we can and do issue guidance under present legislation; we have already done so in anticipation of the implications of the Water Framework Directive. We do not need new powers in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the Minister concludes, will he comment on paragraph (e) at line 27 on page 43? It refers to the need,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xto contribute to the achievement of sustainable development",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-26_para13"></a>
which is a worthy goal that I fully support. Is it necessary to have that in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This involves the substitution of a section in the previous regulations, which updates it. Normally, I am pressed by the Liberal Democrats to include sustainable development on virtually every page of the Bill. I am not quite sure what point the noble Baroness is making.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-26_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My point is that when the Minister responded to the amendment, he said that the amendments tabled by myself and my noble friend Lord Livsey to the Water Framework Directive were not necessary because that would happen anyway. I suggest that it is necessary to have those amendments in the Bill. I would be very pleased if the amendment on sustainable development were included in the Bill.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para14"></a>If we keep ignoring the Water Framework Directive and do not include it in any of the matters to which the various bodies must pay attention, guidance will of course later refer to that. As we said at the beginning of the Bill's Committee stage, that is unsatisfactory in terms of the start of the process for introducing the most important piece of water legislation for the past 20 years. We should also consider the fact that if that is not included in the Bill, it will be seen as a less important issue than those matters that are included. If the Minister does not believe that that will be the case, I should be relieved. The fact that it is not in the Bill and is not primary legislation will make it appear to be a less important issue.
<P>

<a name="30408-26_para15"></a>When I moved the amendment, I asked the Minister about a specific example. River basin management might require the planting of a forest, which is a very wide point for the water industry authority to take account of. As water cycle issues are increasingly taken into account, a company might be required to regard that as relevant. Without our amendment, the sorts of directive-related programmes referred to in the amendment will be seen as being less worthy than other issues in the Bill. I shall return to this on Report, when we will again discuss the Water Framework Directive. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-27_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: In this amendment, we are considering the whole question of good regulation or better regulation. The Better Regulation Task Force, which was established back in September 1997, is, as noble Lords will know, an independent body that advises the Government on action to ensure that regulation and enforcement accord with the five principles of good regulation, which are set out in the relevant document.

<a name="30408-27_para1"></a>We want to ensure that the five principles of good regulation are recognised in the Bill to ensure that all regulators follow those principles.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-27_para2"></a>
in other words, that involves not considering other bits where no action is needed. We believe that that would save costs to the Government and the water companies in terms of management time and cost time. If we can save in relation to such costs, that would obviously help the consumer. All costs that are put on water companies eventually get passed on to the consumer. If we target only cases in which action is needed, it appears to us logical that the Government would agree to that.

<A NAME="30408-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment, to which my name and that of my noble friend Lord Livsey are attached. It is very important. I expect that the Minister will again say that it is not necessary to include such provisions in the Bill. In a Bill that is very long on detail, it would be nice if some of the principles underpinning its entire regulatory nature were spelt out and reinforced. We have debated in previous sittings some of our concerns about proportionality and targeting. The amendment would strengthen the already good example that Ofwat has set in quoting the principles of good regulation in the periodic review for 2004.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My first reaction on reading the amendment was that it comes from the &quot;motherhood and apple pie" school of legislative drafting. Extremely worthy principles are set out in it. It made me feel good inside just to read them, especially when I got to the end of the amendment, which states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe opinions of consumers and members of the public",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-27_para6"></a>
will be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para7"></a>I do not want to make fun of the amendment, because it occurs to me that it has some very worthy principles. Those who drafted it ought to get a prize from the Better Regulation Task Force for doing so. I know that the same amendment features in the Communications Bill that the House is considering. However, I am conscious that although the principles might be very familiar to us as legislators, they are not so well embedded in our constitution and way of life that we can take them for granted. When one reads through them slowly, it seems that they are all pretty obvious. I have emphasised the parts that I think are most obvious. None the less, to have them in the Bill is worth while.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para8"></a>The Minister may feel that it is sufficient as an alternative if the regulators set everything out, not only when they start their working life, but perhaps <P>


<a name="column_GC19"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC19</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regularly in their annual reports. So be it, but it may do good and will certainly do no harm to set the principles forth in the Bill. Despite my immediate reservations to seeing the words set out in cold print, I commend the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I shall follow that ringing endorsement from the noble Lord. I thank him for his congratulations on the drafting of the amendment. In fact, it was sheer plagiarism, because it comes out of the Ofcom Bill. There is a virtue in that because, in the new regulatory system in which we are trying to have better regulation in all activities of the economy and our legislative life, the sooner people get used to the principles the better. We have had lots of principles for years and years that come as second nature to people, whether or not they are noble Lords or involved in legislation at all.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para9"></a>Following the establishment of the Better Regulation Task Force, the time has now come to take on board some of its work and conclusions. I am sure that we all think that its conclusions were superb. They were like a breath of fresh air going through the whole morass of regulation. The five principles listed in proposed new subsection (4)(a), which are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xtransparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-27_para10"></a>
&#151;I call them the TAPCT principles&#151;will become something of a mantra, but they are none the worse for that.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para11"></a>There is another message in the amendment beyond plagiarising the Ofcom Bill. In the periodic review in 1999, the Competition Commission was actually critical of Ofwat, primarily on the transparency route. It told them that the mistake should not happen again, and the amendment might help in that direction. As I say, we are definitely taking on the findings of the Better Regulation Task Force. There should be consistency of approach across the industry as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para12"></a>Do not forget that, when the Bill becomes an Act, Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, the Environment Agency, English Nature, the Health and Safety Executive and, I am sure, many other such bodies will be involved. We want to ensure that people try with 100 per cent commitment to fulfil their obligations in regulation, as in everything else. We would like to know that there was consistency of approach in all the areas. I simply hope that the Government will buy into that, and therefore that the Secretary of State will underpin it. I thank all those who have supported what I originally suggested.

<A NAME="30408-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There is a straight plagiarism of the Communications Bill, which in other respects has not been the most popular piece of legislation in the House. Part of the amendment would not do any harm, but it does not really add anything. The water industry is not the same as the communications industry. The principles in proposed new paragraph (a) are already adopted by Ofwat, and making them statutory would not make a lot of difference.

<P>

<a name="30408-27_para13"></a>There is a difference on the reference to self-regulation. In a fully competitive market, or one approaching full competitiveness such as telecommunications, self-regulation can lead to benefits to consumers and companies, and minimise the problems of official regulation. The water industry is different, however. It is still virtually monopolistic in terms of supply. It is essential. It covers very sensitive issues, such as pricing, cold-water quality, and environmental standards. I do not think that the option of self-regulation&#151;it might apply to communications, and certainly does in several other sectors&#151;should be given the preference that the amendment would demand by implication.
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para14"></a>The regulatory system already works to deliver investment and innovation by setting and policing challenging standards for improvements. Not having precisely the same commitments on regulations as the Communications Bill will not detract from the water regulator continuing to have that effect. Putting an apparent preference for self-regulation in this Bill could greatly reduce the pressure on the water companies to achieve the objective that we are all seeking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I have not spoken, but I agree with a lot that has been said from this side of the Committee. The amendment is excellent. It is a catch-all, really, as it includes all the aspects that should be taken into account. Has the Minister considered the importance of reporting the performance of different companies in relation to proposed new paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)? Paragraph (b) is about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe desirability of promoting and facilitating the development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-27_para15"></a>
How much promoting and facilitating is being done? How much investment and innovation is taking place? How does one company compare with another in those terms and to improve matters so far as the delivery of services for customers is concerned?
<P>

<a name="30408-27_para16"></a>There is a lot in the amendment. Although I agree with the Minister in one sense when he says that there is a monopoly, in another there is not, because there are variations in performance. I have seen Ofwat figures of comparison. The amendment sets out all the aspects that one would expect to find in a report.

<P>

<a name="30408-28_para0"></a>Would proposed new subsection (4)(a) be acceptable? I am really looking to the Minister for guidance. I cannot see any reason not to accept proposed new subsection (4)(c) or (d). He indicated <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that proposed new subsection (4)(e) was already catered for, but would he have regard for proposed new subsection (4)(a), (c) and (d), or a rewording of those paragraphs? As the wording is obviously not acceptable to the Government, they could take the wording away and think about tabling or letting us table another amendment to deal with the issues that those paragraphs cover.

I believe that paragraph (a) is hugely important. I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that he is willing to consider paragraphs (a), (c) and (d). I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(1) The Authority shall prepare and publish a statement of policy with respect to its determination of charges in periodic reviews and interim determinations under all or any of the instruments of appointment of companies as relevant undertakers made by virtue of Part 2 of this Act.
<br>
(2) The Authority's statement of policy under this section shall include a statement of its policy with regard to&#151;
<br>
(a) the carrying out of its duties under this Act insofar as they relate to its determination of charges;
<br>
(b) the matters to be taken into account and the methodologies to be applied in its determination of charges; and
<br>
(c) the extent to which the performance of functions by persons with powers and duties conferred or imposed by or under this Act or any other enactment are relevant to its determination of charges.
<br>
(3) The Authority shall determine charges in periodic reviews and interim determinations under a company's instrument of appointment as a relevant undertaker on the basis of the most recently published statement of policy.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC22</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(4) The Authority may revise its statement of policy and where it does so shall publish the revised statement.
<br>
(5) Publication under this section shall be in such manner as the Authority considers appropriate for the purpose of bringing the matters contained in the statement of policy to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them and shall not be made less than twelve months before a periodic review.
<br>
(6) When preparing or revising its statement of policy under this section, the Authority shall consult relevant undertakers and such other persons as it considers appropriate, subject to the requirements of subsection (7).
<br>
(7) For the purposes of subsection (6)&#151;
<br>
(a) consultation shall be by way of written notice given by the Authority not less than six months prior to the publication of the statement of policy which it is preparing or revising;
<br>
(b) such notice shall state&#151;
<br>
(i) the matters which the Authority proposes to publish in its statement of policy and its reasons for including them in the statement; and
<br>
(ii) a period of not less than three months within which that person may give written notice of objection with respect to the matters referred to in the notice; and
<br>
(c) the Authority shall give each person reasonable opportunity to make oral representations to it on the matters referred to in the notice.
<br>
(8) The Authority shall not issue or publish a statement of policy unless&#151;
<br>
(a) no notice of objection to the policy is given to the Authority within the time period specified in its notice under subsection (7); or
<br>
(b) if one or more relevant undertakers gives notice of objection to the Authority within that time&#151;
<br>
(i) the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the relevant undertakers who have given notice of objection is less than such percentage as may be prescribed; and
<br>
(ii) the percentage given by subsection (9) is less than such percentage as may be prescribed.
<br>
(9) The percentage given by this subsection is the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the relevant undertakers who have given notice of objection, weighted according to their market share in such manner as may be prescribed.
<br>
(10) If the conditions referred to in subsection (8) are not met, the Authority shall (within three months of its receipt of the first or only notice of objection) refer the policy to the Competition Commission for review.
<br>
(11) Where a reference is made to the Competition Commission under this section, it shall be the duty of the Competition Commission to determine whether the policy which is the subject of the reference operates in a manner best calculated to fulfil the duties of the Authority arising under this Act.
<br>
(12) Where a reference is made to the Competition Commission under this section, the Authority shall not prepare or revise its statement of policy other than on the basis of the determinations of the Competition Commission.
<br>
(13) The Secretary of State may by regulations make such provision as he considers appropriate for regulating the procedure to be followed with respect to any reference to the Competition Commission under this section.
<br>
(14) Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by subsection (13), regulations under that subsection may, in relation to any such reference, apply (with or without modifications) the provisions of any enactment relating to the references to the Competition Commission under the provisions of this Act, the Fair Trading Act 1973 (c. 41) or the Competition Act 1998 (c. 41).""

<a name="30408-28_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment deals with the authority's statement of policy. We feel that it is important. I know it is a long amendment. I believe that the hearts of Ministers and legal people must have sunk when they saw the length of it. The Minister nods. I quite understand, but the amendment is very important; that is why we have tabled it. We would not table amendments unless we thought they were important.
<P>

<a name="30408-28_para9"></a>The aim of the amendment is to achieve better decision-making through discussions at an early stage in order to get decisions right in the first place, which would, in turn, lessen the work referred to the Competition Commission. If that were achieved, it would save costs both from the commission's point of view and from that of the water companies, the latter having to provide senior managers who are then away from their job of running the water companies efficiently, which is what we require them to do. We believe that that preventive work would benefit all.
<P>

<a name="30408-28_para10"></a>Concern has been expressed by Water UK that there is a lack of opportunity for companies to make representations early enough. Subsection (7)(c) of the proposed new clause would give each person reasonable opportunity to make oral representations. I hope that the idea will be welcomed by the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30408-28_para11"></a>Subsection (11) places on the Competition Commission the duty to determine the policy. I shall deal with that shortly.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My overall reaction to this rather lengthy amendment is that it is far too prescriptive and not something that we should include on the face of the Bill, because it greatly limits the flexibility with which the independent regulator can operate. In certain circumstances it is also counter-productive. We need to allow the regulator to find innovative ways to carry out its duties.
<P>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para0"></a>Essentially the amendment has two aspects. It would require the authority to prepare and publish a statement of policy about changes in periodic reviews. It would also give undertakers the right to oppose the policy of the authority.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para1"></a>It is certainly important for there to be constructive dialogue between the authority and undertakers, but I do not believe that the mechanism of the second of those provisions is right. The proposal for a statement of policy, and especially the procedures surrounding it, would be somewhat bureaucratic and would not improve the conduct of periodic reviews. Following the last periodic review, the Environmental Audit Committee recommended that the process should be made shorter. This amendment would require the authority to consult on a statement of policy at least 18 months before the periodic review, which would definitely prolong the process.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para2"></a>The same extended process would also apply to revisions of the statement of policy. The effect of that would be to make it more difficult for the authority's policies to keep up with the need for change. In keeping people informed of change there is already provision in the Bill for the authority to prepare and publish a code of practice and a forward programme. They must cover the discharge of all its functions, not merely those of price-setting.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para3"></a>I have some concern about other effects of the proposal; for example, the idea that undertakers should be able to oppose and block the policy of the authority even before it is made. Undertakers can already appeal against price determinations once they have been made, and there is also referral to the Competition Commission.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para4"></a>We need to remember that the authority must exercise its functions in the manner best calculated to satisfy a number of aims, including the consumer objective and the financial stability of an undertaker. Companies therefore already have the advantage over consumers, as consumers cannot appeal against price determinations. But the amendment seeks to go further and to give companies the right to obstruct any statement of policy with which they do not agree. Consumer bodies would have only limited rights to participate. So the balance that is struck&#151;both the balance of judgment as to pricing decisions against other decisions that the regulator has to make, and the balance of influence between the companies and consumers&#151;would be disturbed if this amendment were to be adopted in its literal form. The influence that undertakers would have over the authority's policy would detract from its duty to balance all of its duties as an independent regulator.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para5"></a>As far as the companies are concerned, they already have a chance to make representations. Ofwat consults on its periodic review and its methodology, and many informal discussions with the companies take place. There is already a much more constructive approach to establishing an agreed approach than is implied by the slightly confrontational implications of the amendment. While I understand some of the <P>


<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>motivation behind the amendment, I do not believe that it would be helpful, and it would greatly restrict the ability of the regulator to do its job.

<A NAME="30408-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister. I do not necessarily agree with his assumption that the amendment is too prescriptive and that it would necessarily reduce the flexibility of the regulator. I shall consider that point.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para6"></a>With regard to including all its duties, we have discussed trying to ensure early representation and the chance for oral representations to be made. The Minister did not touch on that point in his response. I should have thought that the Government would welcome any proposal that would enable early discussions to take place. If the industry feels at present that it needs a further provision on the face of the Bill&#151;because it is not sufficiently clear that there is a good line of communication&#151;I should have thought that the Minister might feel able to accept such a proposal. That said, I will re-examine the point.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para7"></a>On the statement of policy, I heard what the Minister said, but I do not necessarily agree with him. I shall read his remarks carefully in Hansard. I shall make no further comment at this stage; I shall take the matter away and reflect on it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30408-29_para11"></a>It is important that co-ordination between regulators is established early. It should be reliable and transparent, and should bring forward everything that we seek to establish.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para12"></a>Each regulator has different, and potentially conflicting, responsibilities. Currently, no binding statutory framework is proposed in the Bill to ensure that regulators work together in an integrated and co-ordinated manner. Water companies and other organisations could find themselves having to juggle different interpretations and priorities, possibly resulting in inappropriate, unfair and costly regulation. That has been recognised in recent <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>legislation introduced in Scotland. People usually regard reference to Scottish regulation as the &quot;horror of horrors"; however, we believe that the matter should be more clearly defined in this Bill too. Were the amendment to be accepted, it would ensure co-ordinated and consistent regulation; it would introduce predictable regulation, and an integrated approach between the regulators; and it would achieve better regulation at a reduced cost.
<P>

<a name="30408-29_para13"></a>The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill&#151;I believe I am right in saying that the Bill has not yet completed its passage&#151;contains, on page 2, a specific provision to that effect. So the Scottish Parliament considers such a provision to be important. Under the heading &quot;The general duties", subsection (4)(c) includes the provision that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XScottish Ministers . . . and the responsible authorities must . . . so far as practicable, adopt an integrated approach by co-operating with each other with a view to co-ordinating the exercise of their respective functions".

<A NAME="30408-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Perhaps the reason for not attaching our names to this amendment is that we were frightened by its length. In all seriousness, we have tabled a much more amateurish proposal, which nevertheless aims to achieve a similar point in spirit; namely, that each regulatory body should pay attention to the duties of the others. Perhaps our proposal was too short and the amendment before the Committee is somewhat lengthy and complicated; but the Bill needs to include somewhere a provision that each regulatory body shall pay attention to the duties and obligations of the others.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para0"></a>That is not only because a good example has been set in Scotland. The unfortunate tensions that can sometimes exist between regulators are unlikely to be solved if they are required only to pursue their particular duties in parallel. We should like them to be empowered to work together and seek an amendment to that effect. Perhaps the Minister will be able to accept this amendment; if not, I expect that we shall want to return to the matter on Report.

<FONT SIZE=3>in different directions by the different regulatory agencies. Although they all have their separate objectives&#151;no doubt justifiably&#151;I am sure that the idea that there should be co-ordination between them would be most helpful to companies and to their customers. In other words, co-ordination is a consummation much to be desired. It would be in the public interest. Surely the UK Parliament is not so grand that it will not take note of useful precedents that may come over the Border from Scotland. If there is a precedent in Scotland that is useful, let us follow it.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para1"></a>My only quibble relates to the mention in paragraph (a) of the amendment, on page 6 of the Marshalled List, where mention is made of the &quot;Consumer Council for Wales". I believe that that body has been included in error. Those on the council are not regulators; they are advisers. I do not think that the council is meant to be included; it is there by accident. Apart from that, I commend the ideas behind the amendment to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I do not think anyone will object to more co-ordination&#151;my objection is not to the length of the amendment&#151;although there is already a great deal of co-ordination. I know that there were complaints about the previous first round of the periodic review, but I think that the various bodies have worked together well as regards the latest periodic review. My objection is to the fact that the amendment effectively gives powers to the Secretary of State to override the independent economic regulation. Subsection (7) of the proposed new clause effectively says that the Secretary of State shall issue directions for everything covered by Clause 4&#151;the totality of the duties of the economic regulator.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para2"></a>The Scottish example is simply a call for co-operation. The problem with this amendment is that it effectively blurs the jurisdiction between the regulator and the Government. It refers to the Government taking a lead in consultations on the periodic review, and then issuing directions, including on how policies should be funded. That would take the Government right into the domain of the independent economic regulator.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para3"></a>I do not believe that that is the noble Baroness's intention. It is certainly not an appropriate role from the Government's point of view. Indeed, the Government were criticised by the Environmental Audit Committee and by the Better Regulation Task Force for what was seen as too excessive an intervention in the last price review. The amendment would provide a statutory basis for a much more substantial intervention. I do not believe that that is a particularly healthy move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank Members of the Committee who have taken part in this debate. As ever, I am glad to have the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on side. His knowledge and experience of these matters is hugely important to our debate.

<a name="30408-30_para4"></a>I accept that in paragraph (a) on page 6 we have perhaps put the Consumer Council for Wales in the wrong place. I shall look into the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It should be the consumer council for water.

<a name="30408-30_para5"></a>As to subsection (7), it was not our intention to override the present position in the way the Minister suggested. I shall look again at that issue.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para6"></a>On the other hand, the amendment received support from other Members of the Committee. The Minister suggested that the amendment was too long. I accept that length does not always bring quality and we may need to look again at the amendment. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether in principle&#151;I am not pushing him on the wording&#151;he will accept a revised amendment addressing the issue of co-ordinated regulation. If so, would he prefer me to draft it or would he prefer to put more suitable words together himself? It would save a lot of time in the long run if he did so because government amendments are usually accepted. Does the Minister wish to comment, or will he leave it for me to come back with this issue on Report?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Perhaps I may leave it to other noble Lords to bring forward a more appropriate amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;NARROWING SCOPE OF REGULATORY APPEALS
<br>
 In section 12 of the WIA, after subsection (4) there is inserted&#151; &quot;(4A) In determining any question or other matter under subsection (3) above, the Competition Commission may consider as determined any matter in respect of which the appointed company does not dispute the determination by the Authority.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-30_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 103, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 104. Amendment No. 103 seeks to introduce a new clause in regard to the narrowing scope of regulatory appeals, and Amendment No. 104 seeks to introduce a new clause in regard to licence modifications.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para10"></a>The amendments seek to build in a provision for the Competition Commission to ignore any matter that the appointed company does not dispute. In other words, if a company recognises that there are problems which it is willing to address, and about which there is no dispute, they should not be discussed again and again. That would obviously save costs.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para11"></a>Am I correct in understanding that, at present, if a matter is referred to the Competition Commission it will have to consider all of the company's working <P>


<a name="column_GC30"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>functions and responsibilities&#151;in other words, it cannot deal directly with specific problems? If so, surely an awful lot of time and money is wasted unnecessarily. Where a company and the commission agree, it would seem unnecessary to carry forward this expensive burden ad infinitum. 
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para12"></a>Amendment No. 104 concerns licence modifications. We believe that water companies should be able to go through the authority to the commission and to influence the content of a referral. That option is not open to them at the moment&#151;they have to go to Ofwat&#151;and we believe that a more direct route may be of benefit to all concerned. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am not attracted to the amendment. Once a referral is made the Competition Commission has the right to examine the total package. The amendment would require it to investigate only those areas in which the undertaker disagrees with the authority.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para13"></a>The Better Regulation Task Force addressed this issue in 2001. It was concerned that any such restriction could lead to companies targeting only certain aspects of the price review&#151;in other words, cherry picking those which they wanted turned over. The same reservation was expressed in the report Appeals Against Regulatory Decisions: Improving the Mechanisms, which was commissioned by Water UK, among others. The report recommended that the existing system of comprehensive price determination appeals to the Competition Commission should remain the central mechanism of appeal.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para14"></a>The alternative is that companies could decide those areas in which the commission intervenes. That is not particularly healthy. As consumers do not have a right of appeal in that sense, the effect would be to allow the companies to decide and restrict the Competition Commission's purview of their decisions. That would upset the balance not only between the regulators and the companies but between the regulators and the consumers. It would not be healthy to move down that road.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-30_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. I did not intend that water companies should be allowed to cherry pick. I was trying to establish whether one could save time and money&#151;something we all agree is desirable. If the amendment suggests that companies should be allowed to cherry pick, I am obviously not too happy about it.
<P>

<a name="30408-30_para15"></a>The amendment does not refer to &quot;must" or &quot;shall"; it refers to &quot;may". I do not know whether the Minister considered the amendment in a different way. It does not seek to impose a duty that the commission &quot;shall" consider. It would apply only in circumstances where it was decided that it would be wiser for the commission to consider only certain parts of a case <P>


<a name="column_GC31"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>rather than the whole case, in which instance this would be a sensible amendment. Perhaps the Minister has not read the amendment in the way it is intended.

<br>
(2) The Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe the relevant appeal body by which particular types of appeal are to be determined and accordingly with which those appeals are to be lodged.""

We suggest that such appeals should be made to the Competition Appeal Tribunal but we are not tied to that one body; they could be made to a person appointed by the Minister to undertake such hearings who would consider the substance of the evidence.

<A NAME="30408-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I have a quandary about Amendment No. 105. During the course of this Bill, we seem to be in danger of focusing almost exclusively on the needs of the water companies. However, this amendment would affect far more than simply the water companies. I do not want to comment on the merits or demerits of substituting an appeals tribunal process for current judicial review by the courts. But I doubt severely that the Competition Appeal Tribunal would be an appropriate body for some of the decisions listed or that it should be the body that would appoint other bodies to hear appeals on these occasions.
<P>

<a name="30408-31_para8"></a>That might be appropriate for bodies like water companies that are engaged in competitive issues. But many of the individuals or organisations who would be caught by this provision simply are not in that capacity and it would be inappropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This rather complex set of amendments would, effectively, create a whole new chapter in what is currently the Water Industry Act. They have a wide range of implications in terms of appeals. Each measure referred to under Amendment No. 182 raises different issues. There is a fundamental issue as to whether appeals under those areas would best be dealt with by keeping the current judicial review in a High Court position rather than establishing a whole new appeals body which covers all of these issues. The difficulty is that any appeals body is bound to have limited expertise and resources to replicate what are, strictly speaking, policy decisions.
<P>

<a name="30408-31_para9"></a>The provisions relating to flood plans, water resource management plans, drought plans, special-category effluent and so forth, are all essentially policy decisions of that nature. As the noble Baroness said, they affect a far wider range of players than the water companies and their consumers. In many of these, the Secretary of State issues directions only to set out what <P>


<a name="column_GC34"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a plan should contain or to get the undertaker to review it. I should be surprised if that was seen as a threat. But what is a problem is if we build an appeal system which would cover all these issues.
<P>

<a name="30408-31_para10"></a>Some issues are best covered by the Environment Agency as the appropriate appeal body; others, as they are primarily policy decisions, are best left to the use of judicial review, as is appropriate in such circumstances when reviewing unreasonable decisions. The purpose of a regulator is to balance the interests of the industry and the consumer and to give a balanced approach both in general and on a case-by-case basis. To have a whole new system of appeal and to extend the appeal to virtually everything covered in the Water Industry Act seems excessive.
<P>

<a name="30408-31_para11"></a>In relation to some of the decisions, that would also be seriously counterproductive&#151;for example, proposals and appeal against decisions relating to the disclosure of information. That would obstruct the powers which this Bill is trying to give to the consumer council to publish information in the interests of consumers. I do not think that the appeals mechanism proposed here is appropriate. If there are problems with particular decisions or particular policies, that is a matter for appeal via the courts. The idea that any regulator's decision can be appealed and is, therefore, a second-guess on all of these areas, does not seem to be sensible, given that we have the failsafe of judicial review.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for covering some of the issues that I raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, said that she felt that this amendment was very narrow and that it aimed at being of benefit to the water companies, but that other people would be affected. Indeed, if the water companies themselves are affected, it affects all the consumers too. They are the ones that are providing water for us, both as individuals and as companies, and that actually get the benefit of trying to get this legislation right. Therefore, I slightly disagree with the noble Baroness&#151;indeed, the noble Lord referred to it too.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para0"></a>However, I have heard what has been said. I accept that there is the right of judicial review and that that has always been clearly there. But that is a fairly lengthy and a costly step to take. We were trying to ensure that there was another way that could be looked at. I should like to take this away and consider it. I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 105.

<a name="30408-32_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30408-32_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 107 is linked with Amendment No. 113. Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 slightly fall within the same remit. With the leave of the Committee, I hope that the Minister is happy to take them together. I know that they apply to two different sections, but it would seem logical to do so. We asked for them to be ungrouped, <P>


<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so it is our fault, not that of the Government. But if I can speak to Amendments Nos. 107 and 113, and then to Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 together, it would be sensible.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para6"></a>Amendment No. 107 proposes inserting the words &quot;and the appraisal". We are asking the Government to take into consideration the cost benefit analysis. After research has been completed, surely some cost analysis should be the norm. It may be that the Minister tells me that that is so&#151;in which case my amendments probably will be unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para7"></a>For the convenience of the Committee I shall speak to the other amendments as well. Amendments Nos. 107 and 113 deal with water&#151;if I am right. Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 deal with sewerage. I hope that I have the right ones linked together. The same argument goes for both sets of amendments. In effect, we are asking the Government to consider particularly Amendment No. 107 in order that appraisal is taken into account. Indeed, it is implemented again later in Clause 41. The same applies to the other three amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As I understand it, the second batch of amendments are, in a sense, the substantive ones in that they would require the Secretary of State to carry out an appraisal of the effects expected from performance, and prevent him from making regulations if the results of the appraisal indicated that the financial impacts of the regulations outweighed the benefits.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para8"></a>We have produced the regulatory impact assessment with this Bill. In that context, we committed ourselves to producing a separate regulatory impact assessment on each occasion on which the powers under the overall sections were used. The scope of RIA is considerably wider than the way in which the appraisal is defined in this context.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para9"></a>Compared to a full regulatory impact assessment, the appraisal proposed is narrow. It concentrates heavily on financial costs rather than environmental or social gains and other indirect effects which are important to the water and sewerage sectors. Therefore, the commitment to RIA is actually a bigger commitment than what is being sought in these two groups of amendments via an appraisal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I am heartened to hear that. I agree with the Minister that if a regulatory impact assessment was in force for these issues it would be better than the amendment, but where is it on the face of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I referred to the regulatory impact assessment that came with the Bill. That is where the commitment is. It is not on the face of the Bill in that sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   The reason for the amendment is to have something on the face of the Bill. If the Minister could bring forward his own amendment to <P>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put the regulatory impact assessment on the face of the Bill, that would be wonderful. What are the Minister's comments on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We shall consider the implications of that. Precedent issues are involved here. By and large the regulatory impact assessment process is carried out on the basis of ministerial undertakings and is not on the face of a Bill. That is because it is essentially a procedural issue and not a statutory issue. Clearly if a regulatory impact assessment is required for the proposed legislation as a whole, any undertaking within that would be carried out were those powers to be used.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I accept his final comment and genuinely thank him for it. We are pleased that the Government will think about these amendments and come back with something that, hopefully, will put the measure on the face of the Bill. That is what we were after and that is what I think the Minister said. My understanding of what the Minister said&#151;we shall need to read Hansard tomorrow&#151;

<a name="30408-32_para13"></a>Under Section 38 of the Water Industry Act the Secretary of State may make regulations for the purpose of facilitating the determination of the extent to which breaches of prescribed obligations amount to breaches of the general duty to maintain an efficient and economical system of water supply.

<a name="30408-32_para14"></a>Clause 40(6), to which this amendment refers, requires the Secretary of State to specify the water undertaker or undertakers to which any regulatory proposals may refer. I am puzzled as to why the new licensed water suppliers are not included in subsection (6). Is there not a chance that these suppliers might breach the general duty to supply laid out in Section 37 of the 1991 Act?

<A NAME="30408-32_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   As the noble Duke said, Amendments Nos. 108 and 112 assume that statutory performance standards will apply to licensed water suppliers. This will not be the case. The standards exist to supplement the general duty on undertakers to provide an efficient and economic system of supply in their area. Licensed water suppliers will use the system but undertakers will remain responsible for the performance of the system which they own and operate. The standards will, therefore, apply only to them and not to licensed water suppliers.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para18"></a>They will compete on price and on service standards and the access agreement will deal with system issues to the satisfaction of the undertakers. It is therefore the role of the undertaker, through the contract and the agreement, to cover this area. Licensed water suppliers will not accept the responsibility that falls on the undertakers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-32_spnew13"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for clarifying the issue as regards the fine line between the undertakers and the licence holders, which takes a bit of unravelling. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30408-32_para26"></a>Sewerage and drainage systems are designed to cope with existing and planned development. The system has to be managed to cope with excessive rainfall and demand. However, water companies have no discretion as to where a developer or householder connects to the drainage or sewerage systems. Some <P>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developments are designed with sustainable drainage systems such as soakaways. This may mean that there is no surface water sewer.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para27"></a>Currently there is nothing to prevent a householder from connecting his surface water run-off to the public foul sewer. Such an overloading of systems can lead to sewer flooding. There is a case for allowing water companies to reject or amend developers' plans for connections in cases where it may lead to problems for existing infrastructure and to suggest alternative connection solutions.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para28"></a>All Members of the Committee will be aware of the proposed enormous housing developments, particularly for the South and the South East. I wonder how much consideration has been given to the pressure that will place on existing sewerage maintenance and infrastructure. Again, I should be grateful if the Minister will respond to that issue.
<P>

<a name="30408-32_para29"></a>We believe that there should be a requirement to develop a sewerage system that is planned and managed in a sustainable manner to reduce the risk of flooding from sewers and which would ensure consideration of sewerage and ancillary works at an early stage of the development and construction process. The amendments ask the Government to carry out a quantitative economic and statistical appraisal. I advanced the same argument in regard to Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111, which dealt with water. These amendments deal particularly with sewage and sewerage responsibilities. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   We had similar thoughts but found a different place in the Bill to insert them. They are found in Amendment No. 185, which is a long way ahead. We shall debate that amendment later. The issue of water running into sewers and so on is very important. I do not believe that it is given sufficient consideration in the Bill as it stands. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Obviously I support these amendments. I said at Second Reading that there should be an obligation on building companies, development companies and construction companies to consult with the local water and sewerage companies. After all, they have been operating either in their current form or in their pre-privatisation role in the area for more than a hundred years in most cases. They know the specific area involved. Too often one finds, with the value of hindsight, that buildings should not have been constructed in certain areas because the infrastructure was not capable of supporting the new development, particularly in relation to areas such as water meadows and marshy lands, which are prevalent in parts of the South and South East, despite our lack of water. That can cause enormous problems for the construction of new developments and for the existing buildings and structures in the area. If there is a way to have an absolute demand that any new development should consult with the local water and sewerage companies, that would be to everyone's advantage.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I want to add to what has been said. My noble friend Lady Miller alluded to Amendment No. 185. We are discussing an important matter. In the past, I have had to deal with specific circumstances in which outdated flooding overflows have formed part of a previous development&#151;perhaps 30 or 40 years previously. Additional housing in that situation caused serious pollution problems. They were not in the South East. Rivers of high-quality water were wrecked in storm conditions because of lax planning regulations when housing was expanded on certain sites.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   While I accept what noble Lords have said about the importance of sewerage and the necessity for developments to take account of the problems that can arise if a development does not recognise what has happened there already and what will be needed in terms of increased pressure on the system&#151;we are in discussion with water companies and the ODPM about sewerage and development&#151;planning guidelines already specify that water companies should be consulted.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para0"></a>On the amendments as such, they are, as the noble Baroness said, the exact equivalent of those we have just discussed in relation to water, and they call for appraisals. I shall not repeat what I said about the desirability or preferability of having the RIA system, to which I referred. My comments in that respect also apply in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to noble Lords who spoke. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, commented on the importance of this matter; it is important. In some ways, it is almost more important than the water issue, although that sounds ridiculous. For those of us who went through areas and were caught out by flooding&#151;that seems to happen so often&#151;the most dreadful experience was not when clean water was coming in but when sewage water came back into people's houses. That is very undesirable. I hope that the Government will give greater consideration to this group of amendments. The householder can do nothing at all about the problem. One can get rid of dirty clean water&#151;if I can express it that way&#151;quite well, but the thought that one has had polluted water in one's house, however much one cleans it out, is absolutely abhorrent to most of us.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para1"></a>I heard the Minister's response to my earlier amendments. I am obviously disappointed that he is not able to give a better response to this group. Perhaps when he has had time to reflect on our discussions&#151;Ministers' notes are often prepared before the debate has taken place&#151;he may reconsider at a later stage. I hope that in particular in relation to this issue, which deals with the concerns expressed about foul water if flooding occurs; it also involves the importance of having enough good sewerage conditions, particularly with regard to new-build houses. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-33_para8"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 118 to 120.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para9"></a>This amendment has a slightly familiar ring to it; we are considering itemising various individuals and conditions. When considering the way in which the council might apply the criteria, it is important to consider households that contain the disadvantaged individual and not leave the clause open to rejection of their interests because another individual who is in the house does not meet those criteria. We have been given a request to have regard to the needs of full-time students. If a household of several students had one individual who did not meet the low-income criteria, the clause might allow the council to feel that it need not consider the interests of the remainder. By offering to households this consideration, that danger might be eliminated. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Amendments Nos. 117 to 120 would change the emphasis from individuals to households when it comes to the vulnerable groups to which the consumer council must have regard.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para10"></a>Could I reassure the noble Duke that if the interests of the individual are to be considered, the council is in effect already considering the interests of the household containing such an individual? This is the mirror image&#151;the exact opposite&#151;of the views that he expressed. That is particularly true with regard to water and sewerage services that are supplied to the premises as a whole in which the individual lives. That would be the case with issues related to water pricing. That is reflected in the vulnerable groups scheme, which is aimed at households that combine low income and unavoidable high-water use. However, there are occasions when the interests of the individual go beyond the interests of the household. For example, illness&#151;such as the need for home dialysis&#151;may make a consumer particularly vulnerable to interruptions in the water supply. We should ensure that the consumer council is able to have regard to those circumstances as well. The clause has been carefully drafted to achieve that without the noble Duke's amendment. I hope that, with that explanation, he feels satisfied that we are in agreement about what we want the Bill to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-33_spnew7"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for placing that explanation on the record, which is very much what we wanted. It proves that whatever the state of the household or the individual, it will receive the consideration that the council should give it. In view of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-33_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment and those grouped with it deal with two issues, the first of which involves the fact that the Bill appears to require the consumer council for water and Ofwat to publish an explanation. I should be grateful for the Government's views on which of those bodies should publish what sets of information. Secondly, the amendments aim to give back to the consumer council for water the power that the Bill currently proposes to remove from it; that is, the power of being able to publish large swathes of information.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para15"></a>The defence of that is that it might well affect a company's share price if certain information was disclosed. We would prefer the Bill to be drafted in a different way, so that the consumer council for water could discover and require all the information from the water undertakers, and then decide in its opinion what information was able to be disclosed.
<P>

<a name="30408-33_para16"></a>It will be very difficult for the consumer council for water to fulfil its role sufficiently and as fully as we believe that it should be able to if the Bill stays as it is. As it is drafted, there are many occasions on which the defence of the water industry, should it choose to use it, could be, &quot;Well, that information will lay us open to unfair competition or is commercially sensitive" and so on. The amendments are designed to discover the Government's thinking in drafting the Bill in such a way that the consumer council for water has far too little power in terms of requiring information.

<FONT SIZE=3>group. If the three provisions that they would remove were left in the Bill, they would have the effect of leaving with the authority the responsibility for gathering necessary information, removing from the authority the responsibility for publishing the necessary information, and giving the publication responsibility to the council. The noble Baroness has covered the same subject, perhaps in slightly different words.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para0"></a>As a result of our three amendments, I ask the Minister what the rationale behind the provisions is. Does he consider them to be a reasonable reallocation of responsibilities or does he think, as we are suggesting, that it is not a very satisfactory position for the council to be put in? When we have debated the issues before, the Liberal Democrats may have gone in a slightly different direction from us, but some of the information that they think that the council should be able to have might well be confidentially and economically not that which is relevant to the council itself.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para1"></a>As I say, our three amendments are little ones. They are about clarity. The first is on the gathering of information, the second on publishing, and the third on whether all the responsibility is put on the council. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The bulk of the amendments deal with the relationship between the council and the authority in terms of publication. It is worth bearing in mind that the provisions in the Bill are the same as those in the Utilities Act that set up Energywatch, the equivalent to the consumer council for water. They ensure that the consumer council takes into account any opinion expressed by the authority. The amendments suggest that we remove that requirement to have regard to the opinion of the authority.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para2"></a>I recognise the need for the independence of the council, but simply distancing itself from the authority and removing the necessity to have that regard could have a detrimental effect. There are quite a lot of technical issues involved in assessing whether publishing information can have serious prejudicial effects on companies or others. Therefore the advice of the authority would be appropriate, and it makes sense for the council to be able to draw on that expertise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The group is split. It would certainly help me&#151;I cannot speak for the whole Committee&#151;if the noble Lord mentioned which amendments he is referring to as he goes through. That would be hugely helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am referring to the bulk of the amendments in the group. Amendments Nos. 121, 124, 132 and 155 deal with four different types of publication&#151;advice to public authorities, advice and information about consumer matters, reasons for refusing to supply information, and the power to investigate other matters. All four areas are dealt with by the bulk of the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. They repeat the elimination of the requirement that the council should have regard to the view of the authority, presumably on the grounds <P>


<a name="column_GC43"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we must ensure that the council is independent, as she said. I question whether independence requires it not to have regard to the views of the authority, and therefore I would not accept those amendments.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para3"></a>The three amendments to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred are Amendments Nos. 139, 140 and 141. They would remove a direct duty on the council to publish statistical information on undertakers' performance against prescribed statistical standards. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, also questioned who was really publishing what under the provisions.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para4"></a>So far as those amendments are concerned, I am aware that both Ofwat and WaterVoice support the status quo of leaving the duty with the authority rather than the change in the Bill, which would give it to the council. I take that view and the arguments put by the noble Baroness seriously. I am therefore prepared to consider further the form of the amendments, and accept at least in broad terms the principles that lie behind them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that unexpected willingness to consider some of the amendments again, as I was preparing to return to my idea that the members of the consumer council for water, when appointed, would find it very difficult to operate under the regime as drafted. I am particularly grateful for his assurance and will be pleased to see what the Government come back with. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30408-34_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to Amendment No. 122, and also Amendments Nos. 125 and 134. They are fairly short probing amendments that really seek clarification. What do the three lines referred to in the amendment mean? Is the reference to &quot;paragraph (b)" meant to indicate proposed new Section 27E(4)(b) or, following the direction to proposed new Section 27E(3)(c), to proposed new Section 27E(3)(b)? The amendments are technical. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I am hoping that inspiration on the very technical nature of the points put by the noble Baroness will come to me. Before publishing information about an individual or a body, the consumer council must have regard to the opinion of the regulatory authority about whether the information might seriously or prejudicially affect the interests of the individual or body, and concerning the desirability of publishing such information.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para8"></a>The amendments would remove the authority's discretion to provide an opinion on a case-by-case basis, or by way of a general description of a type of information. We think that that would lose flexibility, which would bring several drawbacks. The practical effect would be that the council and the authority would have to treat each case individually. I am sure <P>


<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the noble Baroness did not intend to increase bureaucracy for the council and the authority, nor the costs, which in due course would feed through to the companies and then to the consumers. I nearly used another word, but I did not want to put another pound in the water box!
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para9"></a>The ability to provide an opinion on a general description of information would also help to ensure consistency of approach which will increase the value to the consumer of the council's publications and contribute to regulatory certainty for the water industry.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My noble friend Lord Whitty would understand. The noble Baroness may recall that last Thursday I was dealing with a Northern Ireland matter and he was here in Committee.

<a name="30408-34_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 128, 131 and 137&#151;is concerned with the provision of information to the consumer council for water. At the moment the Bill states that,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-34_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   We agree with the aim of Amendment No. 128. It is important that the council acts responsibly and avoids imposing an unnecessary burden when it directs the authority or an undertaker to supply it with information. I believe that I can reassure the noble Baroness that, as a public body with clear duties and functions, the Council can only request information required for the performance of its duties and functions. As we are establishing the council to be an effective body, it would be reasonable for it to require information sufficient to perform its allotted role effectively.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para19"></a>It would not be appropriate for it to demand information irrelevant to its duties and functions. Therefore, there is an appropriate safeguard against excessive requests. However, even when it is necessary for the council to have information, there is a further question about the form in which the information should be supplied. That is why the Bill is explicit that the form must be reasonable to ensure that the demand is realistic and sensible in terms of time, cost and effort.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para20"></a>Amendments Nos. 131 and 137 would replace the dispute resolution procedures in the Bill and enable the consumer council to enforce its own directions when the authority or an undertaker refuses to supply it with information. We recognise the need for the CCW to be as independent as possible. But we believe that the dispute resolution procedure in the Bill is a fair balance. It makes sense for the authority to take that role because of expertise in the industry. It will know whether a refusal to supply information is reasonable. I do not believe that that makes the consumer council dependent on the authority; rather it is a procedural safeguard. Furthermore, there is a power to designate a third party if it transpires that for any reason that is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30408-34_para21"></a>These amendments would actually mean that there would be no need for the consumer council to resolve a dispute about whether it was reasonable to direct the supply of information&#151;it would just be able to enforce its own directions. We believe that that would not be an appropriate arrangement. I have gone into some detail so I hope that I have been able to reassure the noble Baroness and I hope that she will not press the amendment.

<A NAME="30408-35_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I note that the Minister welcomes Amendment No. 128 which inserts the word &quot;reasonably". That was a precursor to the other two amendments because the consumer council would reasonably want those powers that we were giving it should Amendments Nos. 131 and 137 have been accepted. I shall read what the Minister has said about the dispute resolution procedure being sufficient, but I have doubts that at the moment the CCW is in a position to ensure that it can acquire all the information that it requires.

<P>

<a name="30408-35_para2"></a><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-35_para3"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving Amendment No. 133 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 135, 136 and 138. On page 51 at line 24 it is provided that the council may direct the authority to give it information. It is not, in our view, fitting or sensible that the authority should then be in a position to direct the council that it cannot supply the requested data because it would be undesirable to publish it.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para4"></a>On Amendment No. 135, the authority consists of a small number of people easily identified and clearly tied up with water matters. The Secretary of State is not any old Secretary of State but whichever one has the environment portfolio. On the other hand, the Assembly is a large body of people. Job titles are not the same as in London. Job content is not the same. The Bill should make it clear that there is a defined area within the Assembly which has rights of access to this information and that no other will do.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para5"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 136, the council may from time to time be reluctant to comply, or feel that it should not comply. It may also feel that it should publicise both the request and the reasons for its refusal to fulfil the same. It is possible that the body demanding the information will be unwilling itself to publish the details. The council should have the right to publish these reasons.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para6"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 138. On page 51 of the Bill, the provision from line 24 onward specifies that the council may direct the authority or an undertaker to supply information. Under the terms of the Bill, the authority has the final say over whether this information may be published. In this clause it is made clear that if the council fails to allow publication of requested data, that failure may be published in the manner chosen by the body that requested it in the first place. That is unbalanced.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para7"></a>At the moment, relationships between the current director and WaterVoice are apparently good enough, so that, in practice, neither would have to &quot;direct" and neither would &quot;fail to comply". The changes being brought about by the Bill may, however, affect those working relationships, and not necessarily for the better. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-35_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Amendment No. 133 would require the council to seek the opinion of <P>


<a name="column_GC47"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Secretary of State when considering whether to publish a notice of reason from the authority on its refusal to provide the council with information.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para8"></a>I hope that I can reassure the noble Duke as to why, in each case, the Bill states that the council should have regard to the authority's opinion on whether information may have a serious or prejudicial effect.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para9"></a>Assessing whether publishing information may have a serious or prejudicial effect on a company may mean examining quite technical details involving financial markets, for example. There is nothing within the Bill to prevent the council from also consulting the Secretary of State, but the authority is best placed to take a proper judgment. That is still the case, even when it is the authority that holds the information.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para10"></a>Amendment No. 135 would allow only the Minister responsible for water services within the National Assembly for Wales to make a request for information from the council. It would, of course, normally be the case that the responsible Minister would make the request, and, where necessary, there would be liaison within the Welsh Assembly. However, the Assembly is a single entity in law and I do not believe that it would be appropriate to treat it differently in the Bill. I should be in trouble with the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, were I to say anything other than that.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para11"></a>I suggest that Amendment No. 136 is not necessary. The protection built into the Bill is to ensure that whichever body receives a notice explaining the reasons for refusing to supply information gives some thought to the implications before publishing it&#151;especially the views of the individual or body which supplies the information. But, aside from the general safeguards on publication, there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent the council from publishing its own notice of refusal to supply information.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para12"></a>Amendment No. 138 would require the Secretary of State to enforce against the authority a council request to provide information. We would expect the authority to behave in a responsible and appropriate manner. However, except for the powers of judicial review, the Secretary of State currently has no powers to enforce against the regulator. It would have serious implications for regulatory independence if she did. I do not believe that it is a road that we should start along, even for such a relatively&#151;I do not deny its importance&#151;minor issue as this. I hope that the detailed explanations I have given have reassured the noble Duke and that he will not feel the need to press this matter further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I acknowledge her remarks about the Assembly, and point out to the noble Duke that there is an environment Minister in the Assembly who would, on every occasion, deal with such a matter. There is also an environment committee in the Assembly, which the environment Minister would consult on occasions about such matters.

<a name="30408-35_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments is intended to give the CCW the power to set a level of compensation and not simply to have to refer the complaint on.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para26"></a>We believe that it is reasonable that, as a consumer body, the council should have the power to set a level of compensation not in excess of &pound;5,000. That will not break the bank for any water undertaker, but we believe that it would give consumers confidence that it would be able to take action on their behalf rather than merely investigate, pass the buck to the authority and be able to do nothing substantial about a complaint.

<P>
<A NAME="30408-35_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I strongly support the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30408-35_para27"></a>I have long experience, for example, of cases of pollution from old pipes despoiling clothes, involving considerable amounts of money, where water companies have repeatedly refused to compensate adequately. These powers are necessary to secure such recompense.

<P>

<a name="30408-35_para28"></a>As the proposed new Section 29(11) now stands, it could be taken to mean that the council &quot;may" report to the authority or to the Secretary of State or to the Assembly. Surely it is intended that it should report to the authority and to either the Secretary of State or the Assembly. I seek clarification because the word &quot;or" links everything together. I am sure that my legal knowledge is not as good as that of the team sitting behind the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30408-35_para29"></a>As to Amendment No. 153, subsection (2) will remove the duties of the authority in regard to complaints. Where in the Bill does it ensure that complaints sent to the authority are not simply ignored as being none of its business? The public are prone to take complaints to where they believe they should be dealt with, and then involve the press if they do not get a satisfactory answer from that source. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I wish to speak to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;that is, Amendments Nos. 143 and 144&#151;and to the role that she has suggested for the consumer council.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para0"></a> The consumer council has played an important role in recent years. It is known generally as WaterVoice, is much respected and has done a great deal for consumers in representing their views to companies, in the areas in which they are located and nationally. The Bill gives it a more important role. It is made more independent of Ofwat&#151;which everyone accepts is a good thing&#151;and the Committee wishes it well in the future.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para1"></a>The council has a role in investigating consumer complaints but, as the noble Baroness said, in her view it should have a larger role in passing the buck to the companies or to the authority. It should be able to resolve disputes and, although the noble Baroness did not mention this, it should be able to fine companies up to &pound;5,000.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para2"></a>I disagree with the noble Baroness on the latter part of her argument. It would be quite wrong to confuse the council's roles as a consumer advocate, as a partisan for consumers, and as a representative of consumers, both locally and nationally, with the role of an adjudicator, especially an adjudicator with a power to impose penalties. That is not an appropriate role. It is not appropriate to join together in one body the role of an advocate and the role of a judge or adjudicator, but that is what the noble Baroness seeks. She proposes that the council should be not only a judge, but a judge with the power to impose penalties.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para3"></a>We should stick with what is in the Bill, which states in proposed new Section 29(10):
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XAfter investigating a complaint the Council may make a report to the Authority, the Secretary of State or the Assembly".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-36_para4"></a>
The previous subsection states that representations may be made on behalf of the complainant to the relevant undertaker&#151;that is the water company&#151;about anything to which the complaint relates.
<P>


<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para5"></a>That seems to be an appropriate relationship between the bodies involved&#151;especially between the consumer council and the authority. Other clauses, which we have yet to come to, indicate that the authority should have power to impose penalties on companies for various misdoings. I ask the Committee not to accept the noble Baroness's amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Very much for the reasons outlined by my noble friend Lord Borrie, Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 are not appropriate. I understand the argument that the consumer council should have teeth, but we should not confuse the duties of a representative with those of an adjudicator and enforcer. There are other ways of giving the consumer council teeth to enable it to resolve disputes resulting in damages. WaterVoice has secured binding mediation agreements with a number of water companies whereby voluntary compensation can be made payable. According to the last report, a total of &pound;600,000 was recovered in compensation or rebates for water customers in that way. We can certainly foresee further development of that approach.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para6"></a>Such an approach would be unprecedented. For example, Energywatch, which was established under the same legal framework as in the Bill, does not have statutory powers to secure compensation for customers who require it. I understand that it is not seeking such powers to do so. It would confuse the role of the consumer council if we were to give it such powers.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para7"></a>As to Amendments Nos. 146 and 147, it would appear that there is some misunderstanding about the purpose of proposed new Section 29(6). Under the Water Industry Act, certain specified technical issues are defined as &quot;disputes"&#151;for example, a request by a non-domestic customer for a water supply, a closure or a restricted use of a public sewer. Those disputes are reserved to the regulator for determination. They are not the same as complaints. The process leads to a binding decision being made and the Bill provides for disputes that are wrongly brought to the consumer council to be transferred to the authority. The need for the consent of complainants is included to give them the opportunity to consider the issue afresh before entering into a detailed disputes procedure.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para8"></a>It is not intended&#151;it would not be sensible&#151;for the council to get involved in technical issues which are properly disputes to be determined by the regulator. So there may be some terminological problems here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I understand the arguments deployed by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that the consumer council should not be able to specify amounts of compensation and ensure that they are paid, but surely in the defence of the consumer it should be able to recommend to the regulator that a complaint should be upheld and that compensation should be paid. It would then be up to that body to decide how much should be paid.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para9"></a>At the present time there is an inadequate defence of consumer interests and, although the wording of the amendment may not be precisely in the right mode&#151;<P>


<a name="column_GC51"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, the functions may not be as well defined as they ought to be&#151;nevertheless it is very much in order for the consumer council to protect the interests of consumers in this respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The consumer council can make an assessment of a case and make approaches to the water companies. It can also engage, as has WaterVoice, in setting up a voluntary mediation process. But the amendments would turn the consumer council into an adjudicator and enforcer requiring compensation to be paid. That is a boundary it should not be allowed to cross. Were it to do so, it would distort its relations with the companies and everyone else.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 151 and 153 deal with a different issue. The council's power to make a report is discretionary. It will wish to ensure that it targets its report in the most effective way and it can decide whether a report will be of interest both to the authority and to the Government. There is nothing to stop the council sending a report to both bodies but we should not force the council to do so, which is the implication of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para11"></a>The Bill requires the council to co-operate and to exchange information with the authority, with the Secretary of State and with the Assembly and to record the arrangements made in a memorandum. That is probably the best way of setting the ground rules between the various bodies involved.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para12"></a>If I understand the noble Baroness correctly as regards Amendment No. 153, I think that I can reassure her that the principle of Section 30 that there should be a proper mechanism for considering complaints is carried into the Bill by Clause 45. The authority must pass complaints to the consumer council. The council is also required to pass over to the authority, with the consent of the complainant&#151;which I said in response to the middle group of amendments&#151;anything which constitutes a dispute which is statutorily required to be determined by the authority. Therefore, there is a mechanism and we do not need Amendment No. 153.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank Members of the Committee who spoke in that interesting debate. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that I did not emphasise enough the level of compensation to be paid. I obviously did because he spoke eloquently and at length. However, it strikes me that in other parts of the Bill, the Environment Agency, for example, has multiple roles&#151;as a friend and as an enforcer. But in terms of the consumer council for water, that body is not allowed to have multiple roles.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para13"></a>Therefore, while I would accept what the Minister said, I shall balance it with the role being drawn up for the Environment Agency. I reserve my right to come back on this amendment at a later stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-36_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Baroness withdraws the amendment, I should be grateful for the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Minister's observation on her point about the Environment Agency. Constantly through this Bill, we have been questioning the position of the Environment Agency. I am now in a ridiculous position. In some ways, I do not support the noble Baroness's amendments in the way that she would like me to, but she raises a very important question which the Minister has not answered sufficiently. Therefore, I encourage him perhaps to return this: how can there be one set of rules for one authority and one set of rules for another? If that is to be so, the rules should be expressed more clearly than they are in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="30408-36_para14"></a>So before the noble Baroness withdraws her amendment, I should be glad of further explanation from the Minister. I am not asking for what the noble Baroness is asking for on these particular amendments. But I have raised and will continue to raise throughout this Bill the issue of the very real position that the Environment Agency finds itself in, with greater freedom to be judge and jury of everything and with no comeback to even Parliament. I do not find that satisfactory. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say to my question before the noble Baroness withdraws her amendment.

It is well known that there is a statutory basis for the Environment Agency having a number of different responsibilities, but all that is wrapped up in its own operation. What we are talking about here is a consumer council. We can pursue this issue at another point in the Bill. The noble Baroness may have an objection to a particular power or duty of the Environment Agency but I do not think that that is particularly relevant to these amendments.

<A NAME="30408-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall explain it in a different way. Perhaps sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander would be a simpler and well-known way of putting it. If we can have one body that has multiple functions as friend/critic/enforcer/adjudicator, that could be the precedent for another body having the same powers. The Minister said that the Environment Agency has those roles on a statutory basis. In tabling these amendments, that is exactly what I am arguing that the consumer council for water should have. The Minister can hardly say that my amendments are not relevant when I am trying simply to give the statutory basis, as he said, that the Environment Agency has. It has crept in because I am drawing a parallel, as I am sure that he actually knows.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para0"></a>However, I shall consider what the Minister said and keep his remarks in mind. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 59, line 9, leave out &quot;(1) or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-37_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30408-37_para9"></a>The noble Duke said: In speaking to Amendment No. 158, I speak also to Amendments Nos. 159, 160, 161 and 161A. Again, this is perhaps a slightly varied menu and I hope that it helps warm the cockles of the heart of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord on the other side that we are getting through so many items. These amendments all concern penalties. Under subsection (1) only the authority has a right to impose a penalty, so there should be no question of the Secretary of State or the Assembly doing so.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para10"></a>Amendment No. 159 is a probing amendment. The period of 42 days is almost certainly intended to be six weeks, but the Bill does not say so. Company accounts departments usually work a five day week, excluding bank holidays. This wording might throw them out, unless it is made clear in the Bill as to what is intended.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para11"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 160, perhaps the Minister can tell us on what the 10 per cent is based. Does he regard 10 per cent as the anticipated annual profit of a water company? Ten per cent of the turnover of Severn Trent is a vast sum. Moreover, a sizeable proportion of its turnover is derived from activities other than that of a water undertaker. Will such a penalty cover all activities? There are also small water undertakers for whom the loss of 10 per cent of turnover would be a death blow. Will the Secretary of State set out safeguards to stop this happening? If a company was generating only 2 per cent profit, it would put the company into loss for five years running.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para12"></a>As regards Amendment No. 161, reference to provision and final orders is contained in the Water Industry Act, Sections 18 to 20. From these it appears that the only way that the Secretary of State can avoid making at least a provisional order is if she decides that the contravention is trivial and has been corrected. Will the Minister explain in what circumstances the enforcement authority will impose a penalty without first having issued a provisional order?
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para13"></a>That is particularly important as the company may appeal only to the enforcement authority itself over the timing of payment of penalties, there being, apparently, no independent body allowed for. If the company wishes to dispute the amount of a penalty, up to 10 per cent of turnover, it must go to the High Court. Is it reasonable that any company, but especially a small one, should be faced by a penalty of up to 10 per cent of turnover, imposed without an order 12 months after the contravention or failure? Is it fair that that company's only recourse should then be to the High Court?
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para14"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 161A. On page 61, lines 23 and 24, reference is made to charging interest at the rate specified in Section 17 of the Judgements Act of 1838. Will that same rate apply to this section? If not, will the Minister state whether the rate to be <P>


<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specified by the court will be above or below the rate applied by the enforcement authority when no appeal is involved? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am not particularly taken with any of these amendments but for different reasons.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para15"></a>As regards Amendment No. 158, I am not entirely sure, even after the noble Duke has spoken, what the intention of the amendment is. However, its effect would be that the authority would not have to issue a notice of the proposed penalty and would not have to consider any representations or objections. I cannot see that that is an improvement in the situation from anyone's point of view. It would certainly be contrary to what we intend to do in the regulatory procedure as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para16"></a>Amendment No. 159 deals with the question of days. The use of the term &quot;days" is common in statute, and it is accepted as having a common-sense meaning. There is nothing in these provisions that would suggest that this period of 42 days, itself a multiple of weeks, is anything other than calendar days. Therefore, I am not sure why we need to change it.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para17"></a>On Amendment No. 160, the amendment would reduce the maximum level of a penalty that an enforcement authority could impose from 10 per cent to 1 per cent of turnover. The noble Duke asked what was the turnover on which the penalty would be calculated. Although there are established bases of turnover, the definition will need to be the subject of consultation and detailed regulation. The amendment proposes to reduce the figure from 10 per cent to 1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para18"></a>The figure of 10 per cent does not make its first appearance in this Bill. It already appears in the Competition Act 1998 as the limit to a penalty for restrictive agreements or for abuse of dominant position. There is also a 10 per cent limit in the Utilities Act 2000. That was introduced at Report stage in this Chamber in response to cross-party lobbying led by the noble friends of the noble Duke on the Opposition Benches.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para19"></a>Reducing the maximum penalty to 1 per cent would be out of kilter with the provisions in those pieces of legislation and would limit the enforcement authorities' ability to deal with companies that breach their conditions of appointment or other statutory duties. We must also bear in mind the significant public health or environmental damage that might result from a breach of such duties.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para20"></a>Amendment No. 161 would delete references to the time limits that apply to financial penalties where no final or provisional enforcement order has been made. The effect of the amendment would be absolutely to prohibit the enforcement authority from being able to impose a financial penalty in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para21"></a>It is surely appropriate that financial penalties can be imposed in circumstances such as the breach of a condition of appointment, where it may not be appropriate to go through the full enforcement order process.
<P>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para22"></a>The Bill as drafted includes a 12-month time limit on the ability of the enforcement authority to start within a year a free-standing process of imposing a penalty. This gives companies the ability to have a clearer expectation of what might happen so that they are able to plan ahead.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para23"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 161A. The Bill is drafted so that the court will be able to set the level of interest. It is appropriate for the court to have this flexibility to deal with appeals on a case-by-case basis. The effect of the amendment would be that the court would be tied to the same decision whenever there was a successful appeal, regardless of the seriousness of the company's failure or of the merits of the case. I do not believe that it would be appropriate to tie the hands of the court in such a way.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para24"></a>The noble Duke also raised the question of whether the Secretary of State should be able to set the level of penalties. That provision is only an extension of the existing enforcement procedure. It appears in the Bill, in the Water Industry Act and in other pieces of legislation. Drinking water quality is the responsibility of the Drinking Water Inspectorate which is part of the apparatus of the Secretary of State. That is why there is a specific reference to financial penalties being set by the Secretary of State in that context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-37_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for his various replies. In some ways Amendment No. 158 was a probing amendment. It seems to me that what the Bill is trying to say is that the authority can impose penalties under subsection (1) and the Secretary of State can impose penalties under subsection (2). The fact that they are run together looks slightly strange. However, I pass that by.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para25"></a>I was grateful to hear the Minister mention maintaining flexibility. That is a good idea as regards penalties. In view of what the Minister said on all the other matters, I shall take away the amendments and reconsider them. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30408-37_para32"></a>In the 1991 Act the Secretary of State or the director has to be satisfied that the company has transgressed and is likely to do so again. The requirement for satisfaction has not altered, only now it is not necessary for wrongdoing already to have occurred.

<FONT SIZE=3>or requirement is inherently unreasonable or some set of circumstances has arisen that will mean that the company is bound to be in difficulty.
<P>

<a name="30408-37_para34"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 161C. This is beginning to read like a vendetta on water and sewerage companies. First, they no longer have to have transgressed to find themselves in serious difficulty. Now they have 21 days instead of 28 to make representations against what may be both a harsh and wholly unjustified charge. Will the Minister lay out a believable scenario which explains why the Government have thought it necessary to write these provisions into the Bill? I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have proposed a change to the existing enforcement provisions so that the enforcement authorities&#151;the Secretary of State, the Assembly and the authority&#151;are able to take action before something goes wrong. This proposal would be reversed by Amendment No. 161B.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para0"></a>It is important to distinguish between the order and the penalty. It is important to bear in mind that although there are penalties for breaching an enforcement order, the order itself is first and foremost to tell the recipient what action they must take to rectify a situation that has gone wrong.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para1"></a>If it is apparent that a contravention is about to happen, the regulator or the Secretary of State should be able to take steps to prevent it via an enforcement order. One of the safeguards in the enforcement order procedure is that the enforcement authority must notify the proposed recipient before making an order. The proposed recipient can then make objections. In those circumstances it is sensible and desirable to make an order.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para2"></a>Amendment No. 161C would remove the proposal in the Bill to speed up the enforcement process by reducing from 28 days to 21 days the minimum time that can be allowed for objecting to a notice informing someone that an order is being considered. The reason for this change in the Bill is to reduce the time in which further harm can occur. Therefore, the reduction in the number of days is sensible. If an enforcement order is being considered, the matter is usually already serious and it is important that the action that the order will require should be taken as rapidly as possible. In more complex cases, the notice can specify a longer time that would be more appropriate to those circumstances but in many cases 21 days should be the appropriate minimum time.

<A NAME="30408-38_spnew1"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. We asked him to describe some scenarios. Are there frequent examples about which he knows in which the question of 21 or 28 days would have been vital? Did the things that went wrong go that seriously wrong that they required the reduction in the amount of time for which the people accused could appeal? Foreseeing the damage and accusing people before it happens is a very difficult concept. In terms of water regulation, we are in a fast-moving situation. Could <P>


<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister tell us at some point what situations he foresees in which that shortening in time would be important?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am reluctant to give hypothetical examples because one then has an example that every case is judged against. Clearly, as the noble Duke said, if, in a fast-moving situation involving water&#151;literally&#151;damage is being done and is likely to get worse, the damage done over 28 days is clearly greater than that done over 21 days. Any reduction is beneficial. It is reasonable to give a certain amount of time in which to comply but there can be significant benefits in making the period a week shorter. If problems are considerably more complex, it is reasonable that the timescale should be longer than 21 days. Twenty-eight days&#151;effectively, a full month&#151;appears to be too long for dealing with serious damage situations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I wonder whether I may press the Minister further. Presumably, if there are emergencies&#151;I do not believe that this falls into that category&#151;there are facilities in the Bill by which everything gets overridden and emergencies are dealt with. My noble friend did not ask the Minister to give an example of a particular case; he asked the Minister more generally how many times in the past&#151;let us say, the past two years&#151;the regulators have found themselves at difficulty when working with the 28-day system. In other words, what pressure has been brought to bear to change the period from 28 to 21 days? That was the question; my noble friend did not ask for an example of a particular company or occurrence. Will the Minister clarify that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No, I cannot clarify that because records will not be kept in that form. That is for the reasons that I have expounded. If we bring the period down to the minimum reasonable level of three weeks, we would be dealing with more situations more effectively than we might otherwise have done. Giving people three weeks in which to comply is not unreasonable; giving them 28 days&#151;another week&#151;if one is at the other end of the damage threatened is not justifiable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I hear what the Minister said but it does not quite answer our discussion. Presumably somewhere in the Bill is the ability to make emergency provisions, but that is not what we are discussing; we are discussing asking for some damage to be put right. I ask the Minister what facts have brought the Government to wish to reduce the timescale from 28 to 21 days? In fairness, he has not answered that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   All I can say is that 21 days is the equivalent period in the other utility provisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that answer; we had not had it previously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew8"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   The question raised was: what is an emergency? If something is causing great damage, it will do so during the first seven days. I <P>

<br>
9 In making provision for the matters in paragraph 8 the rules shall set out the principles to be followed for the award of costs or expenses and for taxing or otherwise settling such costs or expenses.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-38_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment, which appears in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Byford, deals with a situation in which there have been appeals to the Competition Commission by individual water companies. If the appeal, or the costs of the appeal, go against the water companies, customers of that water company would be liable for the cost of that appeal. The consumer body, WaterVoice, is particularly angry about all of that. The subtext of what we would like in this regard is that the Competition Commission should be given discretion&#151;that should not be automatic in the case of, for example, a nonsense appeal&#151;to allocate the costs to Ofwat. The costs would therefore be spread over all the water companies if the issue was of national significance. Some water companies might appeal for something that was &quot;piggybacked on" by other water companies, and the poor water company that had led the appeal and incurred all the costs found itself to be disadvantaged and the customers of that company would find themselves with higher prices.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para9"></a>The director general should be under a duty to implement the Competition Commission's decisions for all water companies. That is the point in essence. I am interested that this amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 162A, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-38_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 162A and comment on Amendment No. 162. When a company challenges Ofwat's determination as to the prices that the company may in future charge its customers, it does so by seeking a reference to the Competition Commission. When the Competition Commission redetermines the price limits set by Ofwat, the present law requires the Competition <P>


<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commission to provide in those price limits for the company's costs in pursuing the case before the Competition Commission, Ofwat's costs and the Competition Commission's costs. Those costs therefore fall ultimately on the customers. The only ground on which the Competition Commission may currently decline to allow for such costs in the price limits that it determines is if it considers the company's request for a reference to the Competition Commission or the costs incurred to be unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para10"></a>A company currently appears to have little or no incentive to refrain from testing Ofwat's new price limits by going to the Competition Commission. In reports from the Competition Commission in 2000 about price limits set for Mid Kent Water and for Sutton and East Surrey Water, the Competition Commission stated the present law and had to follow it but questioned the desirability of invariably having to permit costs in such inquiries to be recovered from customers.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para11"></a>The purpose of the amendment, on which I have been greatly assisted by Ofwat, ensures that the Competition Commission should first conclude what price limits it should determine on the normal principles of what is necessary to enable the company to perform its normal core functions and to enable it to get a reasonable return on its capital. Then it will separately decide the fair allocation of costs between the company's customers, its shareholders, the customers of other regulated companies, and taxpayers.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para12"></a>In my view, the commission should have statutory discretion to decide what is just in each case, and therefore to decide whether the company's case had any substance, whether it had convinced the Competition Commission on any of the points that it contended for, and whether the company's method of presenting its arguments and the costs incurred were appropriate and reasonable. If the Competition Commission decided that the company had acted properly in pursuing its case, it would in principle be expected to include the company's cost in the new price limits&#151;and so too the costs of Ofwat and the Competition Commission.
<P>

<a name="30408-38_para13"></a>I am not sure whether I am right or not, but Amendment No. 162 seems to concern all references to the Competition Commission, not only those relating to price determinations. It deals generally with the allocation and setting of all costs incurred in such references through the making of rules by the Competition Commission. Amendment No. 162A ensures a discretion to the Competition Commission to decide whether costs faced by the company should be included in the price limits determined by the commission.

<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Government ought to consider. Amendment No. 162A in particular raises the question of whether it is sensible to continue to give no discretion to the competition authority as to where it allocates the costs. Some of the arguments in support of that by my noble friend are correct. Although Amendment No. 162 goes somewhat wider and I would not accept going quite so wide as it, I agree to take the amendments away together and I hope to come back on Report with a proposition from the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   May I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I failed to note that her name had been added to the amendment. I was speaking to save her time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I stagger to my feet. My name is attached to Amendment No. 162. When we tabled the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, had obviously not tabled Amendment No. 162A. I was interested to read that his amendment particularly tried to give discretion to the Competition Commission.
<P>

<a name="30408-39_para0"></a>I should say straight away that I am very grateful for the Minister's indication that he will look at the two amendments, and I do not want to prolong the Committee. The only point that I want to make is particularly in relation to Amendment No. 162. Others speak with great authority because they are on water authorities, but I am not. I speak with a consumer's hat on, as the customer. As an outsider, it is a concern that the costs as the Bill stands will&#151;I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;be handed directly to individual customers. That is bad enough in a big water company, but in a small water company the costs will be proportionately much higher.
<P>

<a name="30408-39_para1"></a>That is the additional point that I wanted to underline. If the Minister is kindly to take the amendment away and consider it, I would hate him to come back on Report only for us to jump up again and say, &quot;But, my Lord, you have not considered the matter fully". I am sure that the Government would not want that to be a result of the present drafting of the Bill.

<a name="30408-39_para2"></a>With those few words, I express my grateful thanks to the Minister, although my noble friend will do so formally for us. I also wanted simply to highlight the whole question of costs and the effect that they have on smaller companies.

<P>

<a name="30408-39_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is probing. We are concerned that it would appear that, if a licensed water supplier had an authorisation to introduce water into the supply system of a water undertaker, he may not use the water supplied by another licensed water supplier. I find that extraordinary. Is that correct? If so, why the prohibition? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There is indeed a prohibition in the Bill as it stands. The provisions require licensed water suppliers who want to introduce water into the supply system to either obtain a source of water or buy water from an undertaker. I am prepared to have a look at whether that prohibition would be sensible in all circumstances. I am not sure that the amendment as it stands makes the right circumvention, but it clearly raises an issue at which we would like to look.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   When the Minister looks at that issue&#151;I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising it through the amendment&#151;will he also confirm whether it will be in line with the Water Framework Directive's requirement, which I think is for water to be treated as a tradeable commodity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It is probably better that I look into that and come back to it on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister. As I said, the amendment was probing.

I thank him for agreeing to take the amendment away and, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30408-39_para10"></a><P>

<a name="30408-39_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is another probing amendment. It is a primary condition of a licensed water supplier's licence that the company may not supply domestic premises. During presentations on the Bill from various bodies, it was made clear to us that very large customers often do not require water of the same domestic standard. I underline the domestic angle.
<P>

<a name="30408-39_para12"></a>Proposed new Section 17B(5)(a) states that the pipes involved will be used to send water from an undertaker's treatment works to the premises of its customers. It does not specify that none of those customers shall be requiring water of domestic quality. Therefore, it is surely wrong for those pipes to be used to carry water from another source to a non-domestic customer of a company that is not a part of the water undertaker.
<P>

<a name="30408-39_para13"></a>Proposed new Section 17B(6), (7) and (8) on page 133 refers to treatment works being designated by the Secretary of State as treatment works for the purposes of proposed new Section 17B(5).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Amendment No. 162C proposes the deletion of the definition of the undertakers' drinking water supply system in the competition provisions. That would reduce competition to the undertakers' non-potable system. That is only a small part of the pipe network owned by the undertakers. The restriction would rule out effective competition. Licensees&#151;I hope that this answers the noble Baroness's concern&#151;will be able, through the competition framework, to require access to water mains from the undertakers' treatment works to the customers' premises. If that is not sufficient to answer the range of concerns, I shall be happy to write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for saying that she will do that. The reason for the amendment is that a different quality of water can be expected for domestic premises from that for premises that do not require such a high standard. From examining the provision I could not discover how water of different standards could be piped down one system. The Minister may be able to inform the Committee on that point; but I shall accept what the noble Baroness has said: that she will take the matter away and consider it. I am an amateur in these matters, but on looking at this I wondered how it was to be achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I can assure the noble Baroness that she has raised a question that came into my mind. As a plumber's daughter, I do not understand how that will work. Together, we shall find out before Report stage.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30408-39_para17"></a>The noble Duke said: We return to the modification of the standard conditions of water supply licences. The amendment is occasioned by the realisation that the Bill sets up competition in the water industry by laying out a new and level playing field for licensed water suppliers. It is fashioned from part of the pitch used by water undertakers but is not level with it. The water suppliers will operate by removing from the water undertakers up to 2,000 of their biggest customers. The undertakers will receive a copy of each licence granted to a water supplier, but the Bill does not give them the right to appeal against such a licence.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30408-39_para18"></a>Modifications of licences must either involve only standard clauses or only change particular clauses in circumstances that do not disadvantage the relevant licence holder in relation to other holders. If any licence holder objects to a change in a standard clause, he has a vehicle for doing so. In all this, the water undertaker has no rights. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-39_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I understand the concern, but I do not believe that the amendment is necessary. When the regulator proposes modifications to the standard licence conditions for water suppliers, he will be bound by the duties under Section 2 of the Water Industry Act to promote effective competition in the interests of customers. That means that he could not promote a modification that would put an undertaker under unwarranted disadvantage. Nor could he, for example, amend an undertaker's condition of appointment so that licensees cannot compete effectively, as neither of those would be in the interests of competition or in the interests of the customer. I believe that the concern is unnecessary; therefore the amendment is not necessary.

<a name="30408-40_para3"></a>
What type of publication does the Government have in mind as being suitable?
<P>

<a name="30408-40_para4"></a>On Amendment No. 166C, once a matter has been referred to the Competition Commission, no one, not even the Secretary of State, should be allowed to withdraw it. It should be the duty of the authority to ensure that, by the time the reference is made, the basic reasons for doing so are well established. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   On Amendment No. 166B, which seeks to place a requirement on the authority to put references in the public domain, that is already practised and Ofwat will have the responsibility to ensure that that continues in line with open and transparent regulation. I do not believe that we need to specify that on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30408-40_para5"></a>Amendment No. 166C is slightly more complex. It removes the Secretary of State's power to veto referrals to the commission by the authority. The water supplier licence conditions are there to implement much of the Government's water supply competition policy. Hence the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to determine the initial standards of licence. Therefore, it <P>


<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<B>8 Apr 2003 : Column GC64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>follows that a power of veto is logically required over a change to the licence conditions. Without it, the policy intent behind the initial standard conditions could be lost by subsequent modifications. It is also important to note that the same arrangement exists in the gas and electricity licensing regimes, and they have operated successfully there for some years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   In the Minister's first reply to the amendment asking for this matter to be put into the public domain, he referred to the fact that Ofwat already does this, so it does not need to be on the face of the Bill. When drafting amendments on something that is already custom and practice, it would be helpful to know when custom and practice mean that there is not a requirement for something to be said on the face of a Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I had written that point in my notes. Is such a matter already on the face of other Bills, or is it just normal practice? If it is normal practice, but it is not on the face of any other Bill, then I believe we should start to include it; if it is already in other Bills, then it should be included here, because the principle has already been established.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   If such a matter is not established, it should be. The reality is that we are not supposed to be mind-readers. Above all, we need clarity and transparency, referring back to the wonderful five Ofcom virtues. I believe that this point is important.
<P>

<a name="30408-40_para6"></a>Perhaps I may say to the Minister that, in our discussions on the Competition Bill&#151;going back some time&#151;I did not realise that we had allowed the Secretary of State to have such fantastic power. What happens if the Secretary of State has a brainstorm and goes mad?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   That could never happen under a Labour government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   The noble Baroness makes a sedentary intervention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew8"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I suggest that we call the undertaker!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408-40_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This may be an appropriate point at which to break the proceedings. Before the Committee adjourns, perhaps I may say, on the issue of what is placed in the public domain, that legislation is inevitably inconsistent as regards what is on the face of the Bill and what is not. The point in regard to this particular proposition is that this is so central to the Government's overall policy on transparent regulation that the assumption can be made. Whether that transfers itself into custom and practice so that it could never be altered becomes a philosophical point. I am not prepared to engage with the noble Baroness on that during the debate on this amendment, which, subject to my noble friend intervening, will be the last <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>amendment that we shall consider today. Such provision probably does not need to be on the face of the Bill. Nor do I necessarily think that the draconian powers for a sane&#151;let alone a mad&#151;Secretary of State are sufficient to warrant the concerns that have been expressed.

<P>

<a name="30408w01_para4"></a>In May 2002, the Chinese State Family Planning Minister told my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development that China's new population and family planning law, introduced in September 2002, would enshrine citizens' rights and the responsibilities of family planning officials. He indicated that the United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) human-centred reproductive health programme, in which birth targets and quotas have been abolished, would be expanded beyond the 32 counties included in UNFPA's current programme. The Minister added that China's eventual aim was to end the system of birth targets and quotas.

<A NAME="30408w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   We are conscious of the importance of safeguarding the detainees' welfare and have visited them on four occasions to check on this. The physical conditions of their detention appear to be satisfactory in broad terms.

<a name="30408w01_para7"></a>The issue of the detainees' rights under international law is linked, at least in part, to the question of their status.

A reduction of 65 per cent of rates liability is allowed in respect of all, or part, of properties used for purposes of a recreation, specified by the Department of Finance and Personnel. The property has to be occupied by a club or society that is not established or conducted for profit and, broadly speaking, does not employ professional players.
<P>

<a name="30408w01_para9"></a>The review of rating policy launched by the Executive in 2000 is reaching its final stages and I can confirm that existing reliefs including sport and recreational relief and that which allows exemption from rates for properties used for public, charitable and certain other functions such as &quot;public religious worship" are currently under consideration. No decisions have yet been taken. It is intended that these issues will be addressed in a policy paper to be published later in the year.

Article 33 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 refers to the right of the applicant to an appeal &quot;in default of a planning decision". When there is an appeal of non-determination of any application for consent under Article 33 or other equivalent statutory provision, this has the effect of transferring jurisdiction on the determination of the application from the department to the Planning Appeals Commission, which is required to deal with the appeal as though planning permission had been refused. In these circumstances, the department will present its view to the commission as to the outcome of the application, but this is a recommendation only and is not formally recorded on the Planning Service statistical database.<P>

<P>

<a name="30408w03_para0"></a>The system will allow families to send addressed letters and packets to individuals serving in the Gulf through Post Office Counters free of charge. The Royal Mail Group will transport these parcels to British Forces Post Office (BFPO) at Mill Hill. BFPO will arrange onward transportation to the Gulf and distribution in theatre. Mechanisms are being put in place to handle the anticipated increase in mail. Further details will be announced nearer the time when we are ready to implement the new procedures.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para1"></a>For the free service to work for the benefit of all, we would ask families to restrict the number of packets they send in order that the system does not become overwhelmed, thus creating delays in delivery of mail.John B
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para2"></a>This scheme is aimed only at those closest to the service personnel who are serving in this operation. We will not be providing a service for packages which do not have a named recipient. This will help to ensure that the new scheme for letters and packets is well targeted without overloading the logistics support network and delaying vital messages and packages from loved ones. For those who might wish to show more general support for our troops, we would encourage contributions to the UK Forces Gulf Fund (details available at www.ukforcesgulffund.org and 0800 107 0200) which has recently been set up to allow the public to support those injured as a result of their deployment in support of military operations in the Gulf and the families and dependants of those who have been killed.

<A NAME="30408w03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   About a quarter of dental examinations carried out on adults in England in the General Dental Service have either no patient charge or else the patient pays a reduced charge. It is estimated that making dental examinations free to every adult in England would cost approximately &#163;87 million at 2002&#150;03 charge rates and current demand. Additional costs would arise if there were any associated increase in the overall number of dental examinations and National Heath Service dental treatments.

<A NAME="30408w03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Andrews:  </B>  Based on the current number of private sight tests, the cost of extending National Health Service sight tests to this group, at the current rate of &#163;16.72, would be an additional &#163;80 million for England.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para7"></a>It is not possible to estimate whether such a change would lead to any additional sight tests being undertaken.

<P>
<A NAME="30408w03_wqn8"></A><B> Baroness Billingham  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What steps have been taken to fulfil the commitment in the Department of Health's public service agreement to review the target for the education of children in care in light of the Social Exclusion Unit project on that subject.[HL2469]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408w03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Andrews:  </B>  I regret the reply on children in care I gave on 31 March (WA 107&#150;8) was incorrect. It should have read as follows:
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para9"></a>The Department of Health's public service agreement (PSA), published July 2002, included a commitment to review the target on the education of children in care in light of the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) project on that subject. Work on the SEU project is nearing completion and we are now in a position to announce the new target, which is to improve life chances for children, including by substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para10"></a>This target will have been achieved if by 2006: outcomes for 11 year-olds in English and maths are at least 60 per cent as good as those of their peers; the proportion who become disengaged from education is reduced so that no more than 10 per cent reach school-leaving age without having sat a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) equivalent exam; and the proportion of those aged 16 who get qualifications equivalent to five GCSEs graded A*-C has risen on average by 4 percentage points each year since 2002; and in all authorities at least 15 per cent of young people in care achieve this level of qualifications.
John B
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para11"></a>The elements of the PSA target relating to the level of education, training and employment outcomes for care leavers aged 19, the proportion of children in care who are cautioned or convicted and the under-18 conception rate remain unchanged.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para12"></a>In developing the target we have been keen to encourage action to support attainment by all children in care. This includes younger children, those who are able to and have the potential to achieve at a high level and those with difficulties who need support to remain engaged with education at all.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para13"></a>We therefore welcome the SEU's proposal that as part of the existing planning process individual education targets should be set for all children in care and local authorities should monitor both the appropriateness and the achievement of these targets. We will be consulting stakeholders on how best to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="30408w03_para14"></a>In order that the target reflects the influence of the care system on attainment, it will apply only to children who have been in care for one year or more. Nonetheless, we believe that promoting the attainment of children who spend a shorter time in care is important. We have therefore agreed with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills that he will put in place arrangements to analyse data from the <P>

<A NAME="30408w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  Following changes made to the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Local Government, the Regions and Fire is writing today to all Members in the English regions outside London to <P>

Voters in two-tier local authority areas will now have a say about the form of unitary local government relating to their area that would be introduced if an elected assembly is established.
<P>

<a name="30408w04_para1"></a>Those who have already responded to this exercise are also being contacted again. In both cases, we are making it clear that we will consider further evidence or comments if people's views have changed in light of the amendments. We do not expect this to cause many people to change their minds about their response to the soundings exercise, but if people have changed their minds we would be happy to receive further views, information and evidence on this matter. If their response remains the same, they do not need to take any action; their original response will be considered as before. Additionally, any individual or organisation who did not previously submit comments but now wishes to put forward views, information or evidence on the level of interest in a referendum can do so. 
<P>

<a name="30408w04_para2"></a>Copies of the revised pro forma have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. They are also available from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website via www.odpm.gov.uk. Responses to this additional phase of the soundings exercise are requested by 16 May, since the Secretary of State is likely to take his decision shortly after that.

The House Committee discussed the new allowance on 1 April, and the committee's third report, which was published today (HL Paper 84), describes how it will be administered.

The Home Office-sponsored Youth Justice Board issued in November effective practice guidance to youth offending teams to help to ensure that current work with young sexual abusers is as effective as possible. We are also funding a study into the characteristics of children and young people who sexually abuse. This is due to report in December 2005. In addition, we have established a two-year pilot developing assessment tools and programmes in three juvenile establishments for 15 to 21 year olds; and the Youth Justice Board is currently mapping services for young sexual abusers nationwide in conjunction with the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. This is due to report in the autumn.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Answer by Lord Falconer of Thoroton on 25 March (HL Deb, col. 652), what agreements they have reached with terrestrial, cable and satellite broadcasters that will ensure that any special national warning will be in a format that is accessible by those who have hearing and sight impairment.[HL2310]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30408w05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </B>  Our current arrangement for warning the public about major emergencies involves using the broadcasters and their full range of services. This includes TV (with sign language or subtitles as necessary), radio including minority language broadcasts, Teletext, Ceefax and through websites. Such arrangements are appropriate to existing and anticipated threat levels.
<P>

<a name="30408w05_para1"></a>These major emergency information procedures are separate from the National Attack Warning System (which my right honourable friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston described on 12 March). This system is maintained by the Government for use in general war to alert the public. However, plans also provide for a considerable amount of public education material to be produced in the period of tension which would precede the need to invoke use of the system. This would ensure that no members of the public were disadvantaged by disability or language needs.

Some 20 countries are providing, or have offered, military forces to the coalition and supporting activity. Some other nations are providing logistical support. It is for the individual countries concerned to decide if they wish to declare publicly the nature of their involvement. The UK's overall objective for the military campaign is to create the conditions in which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations under UNSCRs and remains so disarmed in the long-term.
