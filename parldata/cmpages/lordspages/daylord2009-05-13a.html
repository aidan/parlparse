This is because English bacon, at &#163;6.71 per kilo, is considerably more expensive than Dutch, at &#163;4.85 per kilo. If we were to serve English bacon, the cost of a rasher would increase from 25p to 45p because of the higher price and lower yield. In order to ensure value for money for our customers, the Refreshment Committee reaffirmed the Refreshment Department&#146;s policy on 26 March.</p>

After all, I and many others on all sides of the House have argued that it should not be a matter of price. We have urged the British consumer to buy British bacon because of the higher welfare standards that are applied in this country. Will the noble Lord also take into account the presence in Dutch bacon of a deadly form of MRSA, ST398, which can cause skin infection, heart trouble and pneumonia? Is he not putting people in this country at risk, particularly as the strain has passed from animals to humans? Indeed, when Dutch farmers go into hospital, they go into isolation. Why is he putting the British consumer and those who buy bacon in this House at risk in this way?</p>

The question is one of price. It is our job to offer value for money to our customers in the River Restaurant. The market is price-sensitive and we charge considerably less than the House of Commons, which serves British bacon. Ours is about half the price. Bearing in mind that the staff are some of the lower paid in the Palace of Westminster, I think that that is right. It is fine for people such as the noble Lord and, indeed, me to buy British bacon for ourselves, but when we are dealing with other people we have to offer value for money. As far as MRSA is concerned, I read the article in, I think, the <I>Daily Express </I>a couple of weeks ago. I do not think that it has been followed up by anybody else,

All of next week, extremely competitively priced British-produced tomatoes will be served in all the restaurants in the Palace. I note that the Question was confined to the price of bacon. Might we have a promotional event for pork products that is analogous to British Tomato Week?</p>

I am sure that British tomatoes are extremely competitively priced and extremely good, especially those that come from the Isle of Wight, as many of them do. However, as I said in my original Answer, the pork served in the House of Lords is all British; it is just the bacon where the price is completely uncompetitive.</p>

Unfortunately, the decision was made many years ago that we should pre-empt the regulations that would come in for everyone. I will not comment on whether or not that was a good decision, but it leaves us in a position where British bacon is, sadly, not competitive.</p>

Is the noble Lord aware that bacon cuts are often cheaper because they have lots of additives and water? Has he tried the frying test with the bacon that is used in the River Room to compare it with the British bacon that he has been buying by seeing how much it shrivels?</p>

The test, I think, is in the consumption by the customers down in the River Room, many of whom, I must say, are not British and therefore probably do not mind where the bacon comes from. They obviously find it good value for money.</p>

Members of this House will recall that this country banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion, which had a very salutary effect. Now we learn that antibiotics are used at the end of a growth period for finishing off both pigs and poultry. Is the noble Lord aware of this and are the Government of this country doing anything comparable to the banning of growth promoters?</p>

I am aware that we joined the Common Market some years ago, which means that we cannot distinguish between bacon and other products produced in this country and those produced in other EU countries. As I said, the problem arose a long time ago when we adopted higher standards earlier than other EU countries. When those countries come into line, no doubt we will find that British bacon is again competitive with continental bacon.</p>

Is she aware that this is a particularly nasty toxin that mixes with MRSA and causes the white cells to be killed? Therefore it is exceedingly dangerous.

Very few infections are notifiable diseases&#151;generally they are those where a public health action is required. Available data do not suggest that this is required for PVL, but we are keeping this under constant review. For example, notification regulations are currently being updated, and there will be provision to add new infections as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09051350000020"></a>The noble Baroness is also correct that our priority is to ensure that doctors and other clinicians are aware of how to diagnose and manage this infection, because it does need to be managed very quickly.

The first is to determine the proportion of skin and soft-tissue infections when people come into emergency departments. The second is a study of nasal carriage from a random sample of people in the south-west. We are asking GPs to provide us with samples where there are no clinical symptoms, so we can see how prevalent it is among the general population. In addition, we have commissioned PVL testing of stored samples of Staphylococcus aureus in a Birmingham hospital.</p>

Will the Government acknowledge that the Joint Committee of the two Houses found little to complain about in the part of the Constitutional Renewal Bill that was concerned with the Civil Service, and suggested that it might be severed from the other matters, which were considerably more controversial? In view of the fact that it is not just 10 years since the Civil Service has come under discussion, but nearer 150 years, since the Northcote-Trevelyan report, will the Government, even at this late hour, give us a commitment to introduce the Bill before the Summer Recess in respect of the Civil Service?</p>

Noble Lords will remember the many stimulating debates we had during the passage of the Climate Change Act 2008, which was much improved by the contributions of Members of this House. All three instruments have been laid in accordance with that Act and implement elements of the system of carbon budgets established by it.

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09051350000067"></a>The challenge presented by climate change is enormous in both scale and urgency. The scientific consensus is unequivocal; namely, the global climate is warming and it is caused primarily by human activity. Without concerted world-wide action to reduce emissions, we face a best estimate increase in average temperatures of 4 degrees centigrade by the end of this century, with severe economic, social and environmental consequences. As the noble Lord, Lord Stern, set out very clearly in his review of the economics of climate change, the benefits of strong, early action outweigh the costs. The benefits include enormous economic opportunities for those companies and economies that adapt and innovate to take advantage of a low carbon future.</p>

It is the core provisions in the first part of the Act that are most relevant to today&#146;s debate; first, the requirement to reduce greenhouse emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050 and carbon dioxide emissions by 26 per cent by 2020 and, secondly, the system of five-year carbon budgets, which are set up to 15 years in advance. Carbon budgets are one of the most radical and distinctive features of the Act. They provide a strong framework for delivering and monitoring the emissions reductions required to achieve the 2020 and 2050 targets.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09051350000069"></a>This framework includes a legal requirement on the Government to put in place policies that ensure we live within the carbon budgets. This means that the effects of any new policies that could increase emissions are carefully considered and corresponding reductions found elsewhere if this is necessary to meet the budget. There are of course processes already in place to help ensure that this is done systematically, in particular through the requirement for an assessment of the carbon impact of all new policies within the overall impact assessment. To ensure that the overall impact is to keep us within the budgets, we are developing strong internal mechanisms within government to ensure that every department has a clear responsibility to play its part. We expect to set out more about how this will work alongside the publication this summer of our climate and energy strategy, which will also clearly set out the details of our policies and proposed policies to meet the first three carbon budgets as required by the Act.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09051350000070"></a>I will speak to the first two draft orders before the House today; namely, the Carbon Budgets Order 2009 and the Climate Change Act 2008 (2020 Target, Credit Limit and Definitions) Order 2009, which are closely linked. The 2020 target should be covered first as it dictates the minimum level of the third carbon budget. As noble Lords may recall, the 2050 target was amended from 60 per cent to 80 per cent during the final stages of the passage of the Climate Change Bill. That followed advice from the shadow Committee on Climate Change, which is the independent, expert advisory body established by the Climate Change Act and very ably chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Turner. At the same time, the default greenhouse gas coverage in the Bill was changed to include all six Kyoto greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09051350000071"></a>However, the level of the 2020 target was not amended. It remained at a 26 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions on 1990 levels. The Government made it clear at the time that, once we received the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, we would consider amending the gas coverage and the level of the 2020 target. This advice was included in the committee&#146;s first report, which was published on 1 December last year. The committee&#146;s view was that the 2020 target and our first three carbon budgets should reflect the outcome of negotiations for a global deal to reduce emissions, which is the focus of the conference in Copenhagen this December. It felt that the UK should follow the European approach of setting targets contingent upon a global deal.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1047"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1047</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09051350000072"></a>On that basis, the committee recommended that an appropriate level for the target reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, before a global deal is reached, would be 34 per cent. That level is consistent with the UK&#146;s share of overall EU targets under the climate and energy package agreed last December, which set out the EU policy framework for the period 2013 to 2020. The Government accept the committee&#146;s recommendations on this point. The order therefore uses powers under Section 6 of the Climate Change Act to amend the 2020 target to 34 per cent and extend its coverage to all greenhouse gases.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09051350000073"></a>I turn now to the Carbon Budgets Order 2009. This sets the first three carbon budgets; that is, the total permissible level of the net UK carbon account for the periods 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022. The net UK carbon account means the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the UK, adjusted for any credits or debits. I will say a little more about crediting and debiting later. The levels in the draft order are units of million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the standard for measuring greenhouse gas quantities. The reductions on 1990 emissions amount to just over 22 per cent in the first period, just over 28 per cent in the second period and just over 34 per cent in the third. The third budget complies with both the current 2020 target of a 26 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide and the amendment to a 34 per cent greenhouse gas reduction being considered today. Those levels follow the advice of the Committee on Climate Change.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09051350000074"></a>In line with its approach on the 2020 target, that committee proposed two sets of carbon budgets: interim budgets to apply now, before a global deal is reached, and more challenging intended budgets to apply once a global deal has been agreed. The levels in the draft carbon budgets order are broadly at the committee&#146;s interim level, with a small adjustment to reflect the final outcome of the EU climate and energy package. That package, which came after the Committee on Climate Change reported, results in budgets that are slightly more challenging than those recommended by the committee.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09051350000075"></a>Some noble Lords have called on Government to set the budgets and the 2020 target at the intended level now. We accept absolutely the need for tighter carbon budgets following a successful global deal, but we agree with the committee that we should await the deal before setting them. The committee proposed a 2020 target of 42 per cent under the intended scenario, but the precise figure will depend on the details of a global agreement; after a global deal, and once proposals for sharing out the EU target are agreed, the Government will ask the committee to review its recommendation. We will then amend the budgets to take into account its advice.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09051350000076"></a>It is important that I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to something that we announced when we laid this order before the House on 22 April. We said that we would aim to meet the budgets we propose through domestic emissions reductions alone, without use of international offset credits, outside of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. That commitment shows how serious the Government are about decarbonising the UK economy,  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1048"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1048</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but we also think that it puts the UK in a good position to make the transition to tighter budgets after a global deal. That is because, given that we would expect international credit purchase to form part of the additional effort needed to meet tighter carbon budgets, we are likely to be well placed to deliver any extra domestic reductions that are needed. The committee recommended that approach and also advised that it was consistent with the path to meeting the long-term 2050 target of an 80 per cent reduction on 1990 levels.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09051350000077"></a>I come to the second element of the Climate Change Act order&#151;the credit limit. This refers to the use of carbon units to represent emission reductions, which have often taken place abroad, as credits against carbon budgets, thereby offsetting UK emissions. In line with the commitment to domestic emissions reductions I have just mentioned, the draft Climate Change Act order sets the limit for the first budget period at zero. There are two exceptions to the limit, where credits may be used, although in both cases they would not be bought by the Government, but by participants in emissions trading systems. The Government have consistently supported the principle of emissions trading and it remains our ultimate objective to achieve a global carbon market.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09051350000078"></a>First, as I mentioned earlier, our commitment does not apply to the EU Emissions Trading System. Companies participating in the EU ETS may either purchase carbon units from within the scheme or from the international system, such as credits from projects under the Clean Development Mechanism, if they do not have enough carbon units to cover their emissions. If they have a surplus of carbon units, they may sell them to other EU ETS participants, whether in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. Overall, if UK participants are net purchasers of credits over a carbon budget period, by which I mean their collective emissions exceed the level of the UK&#146;s overall cap under the scheme, we propose to count this as a credit against the budget, whereas a net sale would be counted as a debit.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09051350000079"></a>However, there are already limits on the use of international credits by participants in the EU ETS which guarantee that at least 50 per cent of the emissions reductions between 2008 and 2020 will take place in Europe. In its report, the committee advised that these limits were appropriate and that further restrictions for carbon budget purposes were unnecessary. For this reason, we intend that any credits resulting from the EU ETS should not be counted against the zero limit being proposed.</p>

<a name="90513-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09051350000080"></a>The second exemption relates to EU allowances acquired through a trading scheme under Part 3 of the Climate Change Act. In practice, this would apply to the proposed carbon reduction commitment trading scheme which will include a &#147;safety valve&#148; mechanism that allows participants to use EU allowances to offset emissions in excess of the scheme&#146;s cap. Because the mechanism will lead to a reduction in the number of EU allowances available to EU ETS participants, the Government consider it appropriate also to exclude these units from the zero limit. I should make it clear that safety valve allowances will be an option of last resort. We expect that the price of allowances purchased  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1049"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1049</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through the safety valve will be higher than the prevailing carbon reduction commitment allowance price, which will deter participants from using them. Furthermore, the exclusion does not mean that any safety valve units must be counted as credits, and the Government will aim to meet the budgets without using them, reserving their use as a fallback.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90513-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90513-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09051350000081"></a>I turn now to the third and final element of the Climate Change Act order, the definitions of &#147;international aviation&#148; and &#147;international shipping&#148;. Noble Lords will recall that emissions from international aviation and international shipping are not covered by the targets and budgets in the Climate Change Act at present. This is on the basis&#151;the point was much debated during the passage of the Bill&#151;that there is currently no globally agreed methodology for allocating emissions from international travel to individual countries. The Act gives the Government the power to define &#147;international aviation&#148; and &#147;international shipping&#148; for carbon budget purposes, which is what we are considering today. The reason we feel it is necessary to define these terms is so that they are used in a way that is consistent with how international emissions are reported in practice.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09051350000082"></a>The definitions themselves therefore reflect international reporting practice and follow the approach we use in reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. They put beyond doubt possible ambiguities such as how to treat flights which have interim stops. It is important to note that their purpose is only to set out which emissions are not covered by the Act. The definitions have no bearing on how international aviation and shipping emissions might be allocated to the UK or any other country.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09051350000083"></a>Finally, I turn to the last of the three instruments for consideration today, the draft Carbon Accounting Regulations 2009. I have already mentioned the concept of the net UK carbon account and the possibility of crediting and debiting carbon units against it. These regulations are required by the Climate Change Act to establish a system to define what we mean by carbon units, when and how they can be credited and debited, and how we will keep track of them. The regulations make use of the existing UK registry for holding and tracking carbon units, which is used under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Emissions Trading System. This avoids unnecessary costs and complications in setting up a separate registry.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09051350000084"></a>The first thing the regulations do is define what will be counted as carbon units. Only carbon units that are internationally recognised, under United Nations and European Union Rules, will be counted. These have the benefit of being subject to significant international scrutiny and allow the system to be compatible with the existing systems under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09051350000085"></a>Secondly, the regulations establish a new credit account in the UK registry, into which carbon units to be credited voluntarily must be placed. As I said, we are aiming not to use any such credits to meet our carbon budgets, but we felt that it was best for continuity to put in place the mechanism for crediting them at the start, which we are likely to need when we move to tighter budgets after a global deal.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09051350000086"></a>Thirdly, the regulations provide a mechanism to account each year for credits and debits from the operation of the EU ETS, as I described above. This will have the result that the contribution of the EU ETS towards the carbon budget will correspond to the level of the UK&#146;s cap under the system. Fourthly, the regulations define how units will be debited from the net carbon account if the Government dispose of any of their existing holding of carbon units.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09051350000087"></a>Fifthly, the regulations implement a very important provision of the Climate Change Act. Because the first carbon budget is significantly more stringent than our Kyoto target&#151;a 22 per cent reduction rather than 12.5 per cent&#151;we could meet our Kyoto target and still have a large number of carbon units left in the national registry. If the UK were to sell or give these to other countries, allowing them to offset their own emissions, the environmental benefits of the tighter budget would be lost. To avoid this, and to comply with the Act, the regulations set out how any such surplus carbon units will be cancelled to put them beyond use.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09051350000088"></a>Finally, the regulations establish a register of transactions, to record details of the crediting, debiting and cancellation of carbon units. This was included because a number of responses to the public consultation called for transparency on carbon accounting. Together with the guidance that I have already mentioned, and the annual and end-of-budget statements required by the Act, this will ensure full transparency on how the net UK carbon account is calculated.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09051350000089"></a>I apologise for speaking at length but these are the first statutory instruments to be produced in relation to carbon budgets. I beg to move the draft order.</p>
<a name="time_9"></a>

<a name="09051350000090"></a><b><a name="90513-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051350000349"></a>Lord Lawson of Blaby:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Government for ensuring that these statutory instruments, of which the first is particularly important, can be debated at a convenient hour. I shall not comment on the assertions made by the Minister before he got on to the instruments except to observe that they are wholly unfounded.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09051350000091"></a>I suspect that many noble Lords have not yet read the Government&#146;s impact assessment for the Act that we are discussing, which was slipped out without notifying Parliament, and then not until the Bill had already received Royal Assent. It is a grubby business that rather defeats the purpose of impact assessments, which are intended to enable Parliament to judge before passing legislation whether it is likely to be cost-effective. In this case, the impact assessment states that the costs to the United Kingdom of the policy commitments in this Act are likely to be of the order of &#163;400 billion&#151;a massive sum&#151;which, it notes,</p>
<ul><a name="09051350000237"></a>&#147;does not include the full range of costs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051350000092"></a>In passing, it is worth noting that most energy economists, such as Professor Helm of Oxford, regard the methodology used to arrive at even this figure, large as it is, to be seriously flawed and absurdly overoptimistic. Be that as it may, those are the costs that the Government assess.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09051350000093"></a>So what are the benefits? These are anyone&#146;s guess, but two things are clear. First, any measurable benefit that may accrue as a result of reduced warming would  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1051"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1051</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not help the United Kingdom, at least for the next 100 years, since scientists are agreed that northern Europe would actually benefit from a warmer climate over that period. Secondly, and rather more importantly, there can be no discernible benefit to anyone unless the rest of the world follows the United Kingdom&#146;s quixotic lead, which, to say the least, is highly unlikely. As the Government&#146;s impact assessment puts it, with studied understatement,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09051350000233"></a>&#147;The economic case for the UK continuing to act alone where global action cannot be achieved would be weak&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09051350000094"></a>How conditional is the commitment contained in the 2020 order that we are considering today and, indeed, in the Act of which it is a part? The Minister said something about these targets being contingent on a global deal, but there is nothing at all in the Act or the order to say that anything in them is contingent on a global deal. These are just words from the Minister; they do not affect the legally binding nature of the Act, which is unconditional. What precisely does he mean by,</p>
<ul><a name="09051350000238"></a>&#147;contingent upon a global deal&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09051350000225"></a>If there is no global deal, will the Act be repealed? What kind of global deal? Is it any old kind of global deal or just one that says that there will be technology transfer and nothing else? What nature of global deal is required in order for this to be acceptable to the Government?</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09051350000095"></a>Given that the European Union has made its 2020 target conditional on the outcome of the global Copenhagen conference this December&#151;that was the explicit conclusion of the December European summit on the subject&#151;and will review it next year in the light of that, and given that the Obama Administration in the United States have made it clear that their own post-Kyoto commitment will depend on an adequate contribution from other major emitters, notably China, is the United Kingdom alone in making a massively expensive commitment wholly unconditional? Again I ask: is this genuinely legally contingent on a global deal and, if so, on what kind of global deal is it contingent? This is important because these targets are legally binding&#151;that is, they are justiciable and the Government are subject to judicial review on this whole issue.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09051350000096"></a>While we are on the subject of international conditionality, the Minister will be aware that the DfID-commissioned report <I>An Institutional Architecture for Climate Change</I>, proposes, inter alia, a new international institution with coercive powers to force countries to cut their carbon emissions and suggests that countries that do not accept this should be,</p>
<ul><a name="09051350000239"></a>&#147;effectively barred from all forms of international co-operation&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="09051350000226"></a>It is bad enough that responsibilities for climate change used to be divided between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Energy and Climate Change, but now DfID, too, is getting in on the act. So much for joined-up government. Do the Government accept the draconian recommendations of the report that DfID has commissioned? Will the target that we are discussing today be contingent on some such so-called new architecture being put in place?</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1052"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1052</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09051350000097"></a>Nor is this the only form of conditionality at issue. In his Statement last month on carbon capture and storage, the Secretary of State, Mr Miliband, said in another place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09051350000234"></a>&#147;With a solution to the problem of coal, we greatly increase our chances of stopping dangerous climate change. Without it, we will not succeed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 23/4/09; col. 382.]</p>

<p><a name="09051350000227"></a>He therefore announced a requirement for new coal-fired power stations, which are needed to prevent the lights from going out, to be retrofitted with CCS by 2025&#151;incidentally, well after the date of the order before us. The date was set as late as that because the technology needed does not at present exist, but the Government hope that by then it will. Perhaps it will, perhaps not&#151;but, even if it does, at what cost? At any cost? Is there any cost conditionality at all?</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09051350000098"></a>Most experts believe that even if the technology does become available, it will be prohibitively expensive, for compelling reasons that I do not have time to go into here. To be fair, the Government suggest conditionality in the department&#146;s press release accompanying the Minister&#146;s Statement to Parliament, which states that the goal is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09051350000235"></a>&#147;Full scale retrofit of CCS within five years of the technology being independently judged as technically and commercially proven&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051350000228"></a>What precisely&#151;and I mean &#147;precisely&#148;&#151;does &#147;commercially proven&#148; mean?</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09051350000099"></a>In conclusion, I suggest to the House and to the Minister that it would be the height of irresponsibility for the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom alone, to be required to incur the massive costs arising from the order that we are debating today, wholly unconditionally, irrespective of whether CCS, which the Government concede is absolutely essential, becomes either technologically possible or affordable, and irrespective of whether the rest of the world commits to following suit, without which even the conjectural benefits of this hugely expensive policy cannot possibly accrue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09051350000102"></a>There is a different debate about whether there is some long-term cycle in the planet temperature or whether it is very much down to recent human activity that we are going to go over 2 degrees centigrade growth in the lifetime of some people alive today. That will have problems particularly for low-lying areas, with desertification increasing in Africa. However, if I were playing devil&#146;s advocate, I could say that if population is growing in sub-Saharan Africa at 3 per cent per annum, which doubles every 20 years, the whole world is going to have a much bigger crisis than anything we have seen. If we are talking about slash and burn from Madagascar through to Senegal&#151;religion comes into it and so on&#151;all these different factors are very hard to make a coherent speech about because they go on too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09051350000103"></a>Before I get on to the particular points that I want to make, let me say something about those people who are interested in why the Stern model is flawed, as I believe it is. The noble Lord has been very reluctant to answer questions about my pet topic, which is income distribution and the effect on jobs around the world slowing down by x percent, which he waves aside as very minor relative to the wealth of the world. Leaving aside the inter-generational aspects, we want to know about jobs and so on. If we did not represent people by asking those questions, I do not know who would.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09051350000104"></a>It is very important now that the biggest intellects of public policy on this question do not carry on like ships passing in the night, never conceding any point to each other. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, will nod to indicate that he would be up for that.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09051350000105"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stern, could be encouraged a little. Since he was appointed, he has made only his maiden speech, which was on a totally different subject. We could all strongly encourage all these well informed, two-brained Members to help us out.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09051350000106"></a>I note that the orders will come into effect on 31 May 2009. When I saw that, I thought that rang a bell; it is quite soon. Then I realised that it is very soon indeed&#151;it is in two weeks&#146; time. We have been cutting things a little fine, and so I will be supporting the Government today because if we do not, I do not know what will happen to this whole business. I will give the Government five out of 10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09051350000109"></a>When I contributed to the debate answered by my noble friend Lord Rooker on 18 March last year, and I said that there ought to be a fiscal impact statement, side by side with the Budget, my noble friend said that he would take that suggestion away. That is one reason&#151;I am sure not the main reason&#151;why these orders appear in this form. Certainly, there is the linking with the Budget. It is the first time that we have &#163; million, or

The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, pointed out that we have a total of &#163;800 billion on the second page of Chapter 7 on building a low-carbon economy. We have a figure for investment of &#163;50 billion:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09051350000236"></a>&#147;Tackling climate change requires substantial levels of investment across all sectors of the economy. The Government&#146;s policy framework is enabling &#163;50 billion of investment over the period of the Comprehensive Spending Review (2008-11)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051350000229"></a>That is quite a large figure&#151;there are a few peanuts there, even these days. Other big numbers there are for energy efficiency, renewables support and so on. The biggest number of all is public transport and low-carbon and electric vehicles. That may have a bearing on the next main remark I want to make.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09051350000110"></a>In the first set of announcements in Chapter 7, we see that the fuel duty is going up by 2p a litre from 1 September this year, and another penny on top of that in each of the next three years&#151;that is 2010, 2011, 2012 to 2013. Two and three make five these days, but there it goes. I guess that that will have some income-distributional effects. Of course, the great danger of the macro-Stern approach is to say, &#147;There&#146;s no problem, we&#146;re all wealthy, but who&#146;s wealthy and who&#146;s at the bottom of the receiving end?&#148; If it was a poll-tax-on-wheels, or a poll-tax principle, within a nation in the OECD, and north/south in the world, one would be shouting from the housetops that this is not way to get public support for a consensus policy. Therefore, I request my noble friend to commit to track the income-distributional consequences of the measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09051350000111"></a>I said on 18 March last year that I thought this was a shadow hypothecation. I know that that word is like a red rag to a bull to anyone with a Treasury background. However, the world has moved on and we are in a quasi-hypothecating relationship as regards these figures. They are not normal budget figures but are linked inexorably to a set of targets, which means that we can track them for a good period. If you are going to hypothecate, you can implicitly look at the impact of fuel duty, or installing solar panels on roofs, but as regards the &#163;50 billion and, indeed, the &#163;800 billion, it is very necessary to be wise before the event as there could be a public revolt against all this, even if its merits are confirmed beyond peradventure, if &#147;it&#146;s the poor what gets the blame&#148;. That means no more cheap holidays on the Costa Brava or bangers on the road, but if the people with money&#151;I am drawing on caricatures&#151;can pay for more expensive holidays and cars, that is fine. But if we are going to have to cut emissions by 40 per cent or 60 per cent, guess who will be doing the cutting? I think this is the biggest strategic political question we have to face over the next 40 years but we have heard not a word about it&#151;not a word. As far as I am concerned, this is the intellectual hole in the doughnut.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09051350000112"></a>This situation arises partly because there is a tug of war between the Treasury and all the other interested Whitehall departments, certainly the Department of Energy and Climate Change. My noble friend Lord Rooker told us not to ask the Treasury to do something about the studies that I was advocating as it is a matter   


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1055"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1055</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. However, when you approach the Department of Energy and Climate Change, it says that it is a matter for the Treasury. Which is it? Frankly, this is a much longer term question than anything to do with party politics. Therefore, I hope that no one will make short-term political points about it.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09051350000113"></a>Who are the winners and who are the losers? What is the macro and micro fiscal impact? The Stern report ought to be revisited. The analysis is variable but, apart from some first-class chapters, a lot of it is perfunctory and has not been debated adequately in this House. Stern&#146;s hypothesis is implicitly as plain as a pikestaff&#151;I should like to know whether the noble Lord would challenge it if he were present&#151;which is that we have to choke off carbon demand largely through the price mechanism, unless we are going to shut down for periods due to the collapse of the capitalist system. Minus 4 per cent growth&#151;in other words, 4 per cent negative&#151;will reduce the growth of carbon dioxide. That is a jolly good thing but who will be unemployed and live in poverty as a result?</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09051350000114"></a>The Green Party and Friends of the Earth explicitly demand that we slow down the rate of economic growth. However, given our productive potential and underlying rate of growth and productivity and all other nostrums of macroeconomics that encourage us to increase our productivity&#151;that does not mean a cut in working hours but work as hard as you can, improve technology and increase GDP so that we keep as far ahead of the Chinese as we are doing&#151;that does not sound to me like accepting a rise in unemployment or a slowdown in economic growth. Again, we could get a lot closer to agreeing with each other if the Government were to say that they will not only track income distribution but agree a separate annual statistical series on this whole financial framework, to see how emissions trading fits into it, and so on. Although there are some very clever people around, I do not know anybody who can intellectually grasp all the double counting or interactions between all these arrangements.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09051350000115"></a>Finally, we have to help to demonstrate that, if all this happens, there will be financial transfers, in particular to sub-Saharan Africa, out of the many trillions that we are talking about over the period. It will be many, many trillions. However, we cannot just hand the money over via the public Exchequers to wind up in Swiss bank accounts. This, among other reasons, is why the conditionality principle&#151;even if it is not called that&#151;has to come back to our relations with sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and many other parts of the world, or there will be a collapse of political support in the OECD. We need some numbers to demonstrate what will be the next financial transfer from the OECD to the G77, and then work out its distribution, both vertically and horizontally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09051350000116"></a>We are at a moment of radical change in lifestyles, although not, I think, the radical change of lifestyles that people called for, somewhat rhetorically. We recognise that there will be qualitative changes in the economy, but they will not happen with confidence until we have a statistical framework, so that practical people have some bedrock of data and analysis, on which we can all agree, to explain the position around the country.</p>

I hope that I shall find myself on HMS &#147;Lawson&#148;, rather than HMS &#147;Stern&#148;. The same goes for ships passing in the night in science, which has now devolved largely into a shouting match between extreme alarmists and sceptics, with not nearly enough moderate dialogue between them. Perhaps I could help to gain a little perspective on this by referring to what my noble friend Lord Lawson referred to as the unsubstantiated assertions of the Government, to see where common sense stands on those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09051350000118"></a>Since the end of the little ice age in the late 19th century, the world has been re-warming at a rate of about 0.6 degrees centigrade per century. There have been fluctuations in that. There was a period of rapid warming from 1920 to 1940, much as there was more recently. There was no explanation for that. There was a period of cooling until 1975, when emissions rose quite rapidly. There was no explanation for that. There was a period of rapid warming from 1975 until the end of the century, much as there was from the 1920s to the 1940s. This has been seized on by alarmists as evidence of really frightening growth in temperatures. However, it has been succeeded in the 21st century by nine years of static and, more recently, falling temperatures. Again, that is completely against all the prognostications of the alarmists and the IPCC and wholly unexplained.</p>

<a name="90513-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09051350000119"></a>When you look more deeply into this at where all these measurements are coming from, you find a large number of them are extremely unreliable or, in the case of the Antarctic and the Arctic, almost non-existent. By far the most reliable database, which is not all that reliable, of any large land mass is in the United States of America, where there is a huge number of recording stations. We now know that temperatures in the United States in the 1930s were the same as, maybe even very marginally warmer than, they were in the 1990s. That is probably the best approximation there is for what has really been happening in temperatures&#151;that is, a growth of about 0.5 to 0.6 of a degree per century, a figure that fluctuates for a whole variety of reasons that I shall not go into here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09051350000120"></a>A lot of what you read in the media or hear on the BBC is highly anecdotal, and there is a widespread impression that the polar ice caps are melting. It is worth spending a minute or two on that. The Arctic ice cap is, at the moment, bang on normal in the winter. In the summer, it has been melting a little bit. The Antarctic is considerably above normal. If you add together the Arctic and the Antarctic ice, they have measured about 700 square kilometres above normal in all the time that they have been accurately recorded. So the idea of great warming and melting in the polar ice caps is a complete figment of the imagination. I have, for Members who may be interested, a picture of the US nuclear submarine &#147;Skate&#148; at the North Pole in the winter of 1958, before the summer melt&#151;14 March, to be accurate.</p>

It was completely ice-free. If you put that together with the ice records I mentioned, there is a great deal of myth that passes about the North Pole and the South Pole. The North Pole is subject to currents, which probably explains the fact that it is sometimes completely ice-free. It is not a great static block of ice that is melting. Those are the facts about the Antarctic ice.</p>

<a name="90513-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09051350000123"></a>Laboratory science theory states that doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures by 1 degree. A doubling of carbon dioxide takes place approximately every 200 years at the current rate of emissions, perhaps a bit more. Therefore, the whole argument hangs by a thread. Do other factors such as currents, sun and clouds accentuate that warming or do they decrease it? The IPCC&#146;s theory is that they increase that warming. That is why the Government have, as my noble friend Lord Lawson, said, made the completely unsubstantiated assertion that temperatures will rise by 4 degrees this century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09051350000124"></a>Probably the best climatologist in the world is Professor Lindzen and another good one is Professor Singer. Professor Lindzen calculates that the effect of all these other feedbacks, as they are known in the jargon, is to reduce temperatures not increase them. He calculates that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures by about 0.3 of a degree. You can argue about the science and I am not a good enough climate physicist to make any direct contribution on that. What you cannot argue about are the facts. The facts are that there has been no acceleration whatever in global warming since emissions took off after World War 2 and that temperatures today, after the past nine years of static or cooling temperatures, are bang on that consistent recovery of 0.6 degrees from the little ice age and are well below even the lowest estimates of the IPCC range. So observation suggests that Professor Lindzen may be right and the IPCC completely wrong.</p>

There can be only two reasons for this: either the land is sinking or the sea is rising. Why would the sea rise? The only reasons for ocean levels to go up are either that the oceans are getting warmer and expanding, or that the ice sheets are melting and therefore the amount of water is increasing. There can be no other reason; therefore that simple fact says that global warming is happening. It is a problem and a fact.</p>

He says that sea levels have been increasing at six and a half inches per century since the little ice age, that they have over the past 100 years modestly declined, and that they are now rising at about six inches per century. The assertion of one and a half metres, and Al Gore&#146;s absurd assertion of many metres, are pure speculation and wholly unsubstantiated by observation, or by the best single expert on sea levels in the universe&#151;the IPCC&#146;s lead author, who resigned from the IPCC, if I am not mistaken, because he refused to substitute fanciful numbers for the right ones.</p>

There is no scientific consensus. There is an official, political consensus. There are dangers to people&#146;s careers and funding, and to the esteem in which they are held in official circles, if they express the views that I am expressing now.

If you immerse yourself in the blogosphere, which is as good a place as any to study the science&#151;and where sceptics are much more courteous and open to dissent than believers&#151;you will find that scientific opinion is very divided, and that there are at least as many sceptics as believers.</p>

They have signed up to the most expensive possible version of climate extremism. Professor Carter, a distinguished economist specialising in climate economics in Australia, recently testified before the authorities there that emissions trading schemes would cost every Australian family 3,500 Australian dollars per year for a theoretical IPCC-modelled reduction of one-1,000th of a degree centigrade. Let us suppose&#151;although he is a very distinguished witness&#151;that he is wrong by a factor of 100. It would still be true that the theoretical saving in climate warming would be one-10th of 1 degree&#151;a wholly trivial amount for a vast expenditure. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lawson that there has not been a proper cost-benefit analysis of this, and that what cost-benefit analysis there has been has gone wholly against the government programme.</p>

The trillions that we intend to spend on those grotesque schemes have to be taken from somewhere, and that is where they will be taken from&#151;from adaptation, flood defences, reafforestation and disease control projects. Or, if the money comes straight out of the economy, it will come out of the wealth creation that is essential to survive properly in the 21st century.</p>

It is staggering&#151;as anyone who begins to understand how the system should work would agree&#151;that the impact assessment for what is probably the most expensive piece of legislation ever passed, the Climate Change Act 2008, was produced only after the Bill had become an Act.

It is 50 per cent of the public sector net debt. Public sector net debt has already reached &#163;792 billion, so &#163;400 billion is half of that. It is 60 per cent of total government spending for this year, yet gaily they produce a &#163;400 billion impact assessment as though it was all perfectly natural.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09051350000135"></a>The Act is thoroughly pernicious. I particularly criticise the fact that with gay abandon the Government produce this sort of legislation when they have not been doing the things that they could have. We all agree that it is much better to reduce the use of oil and reduce carbon emissions. However, they have taken 10 years even to decide to go ahead with nuclear power. They have only now produced the list of places where they might have nuclear power stations. They have taken 10 years to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09051350000136"></a>The Government are not even clear whether nuclear power is a renewable. I believe that it is, to all intents and purposes. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, speaking ex cathedra from the Front Bench as Science Minister, said that it was a renewable. He said that; it is all in <I>Hansard</I>, so the Minister need not shake his head. He was of course made to renege, because the green lobby does not like nuclear power. Recently, the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, who now occupies an exalted post in the Government&#151;and he is a splendid fellow to have there&#151;referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="09051350000240"></a>&#147;nuclear power and other renewables&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/12/08; col. 160.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051350000230"></a>I happened to speak in that debate and drew attention to those felicitous words, which have not been denied. However, I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will get up and say that the Government do not regard nuclear power as a renewable.</p>

<a name="90513-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09051350000137"></a>The sad thing is that this Government are going into something alone, probably alone in Europe, as President Obama is most unlikely to be prepared to commit the United States to anything like the scale of what we are attempting to commit this country to, unless the world does so. However, the chances of the world doing so are remote in the extreme. I am delighted that we are challenging this sloppy thinking by this sloppy Government.</p>

However, the world is not standing still. We keep hearing about this enormous sum of money that may have to be spent, but that seems to be said without any regard to the huge sums of money that are being spent by every country in the world at present to maintain their energy supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09051350000139"></a>A few years ahead is something that is constantly referred to as peak oil. What we are really talking about&#151;whether or not we are ever going to get agreement on global warming&#151;is the security of future energy supplies. I say to my noble friend Lord Marlesford that I tend not to be too concerned about whether nuclear energy is renewable or not, as it is emissions free. That is the energy distinction that we need to make.</p>

That may or may not be an argument but, if I understood my noble friend Lord Leach, he said that many people disagree with what is going on but are not prepared to come out in public about it.</p>

There is evidence in the changes in the oceans and in the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps and the ice caps in Europe and the Himalayas. They are all diminishing.

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09051350000144"></a>My noble friend Lord Lawson raised an important issue; it was the one really significant thing that he got into before he tried to carry us all into the upper reaches of this Chamber with a blast of hot air. The Minister made it quite plain that the success of these orders depends on international agreement, which is due to be reached, we hope, this autumn. I do not go with the pessimists&#151;I hope that there will be agreement&#151;but it is legitimate to ask the Minister what happens if there is no such agreement. He made a great deal of the fact that there would have to be agreement, but we need to think about what will happen if there is no agreement. Will he come up with an answer to that point? Although I do not expect us to reach agreement in this Chamber today over the principles of the thing, we must try to ensure that what we agree to at the end of the day will be practicable and will work. The Minister must address that in his reply.</p>

I just ask noble Lords to put their minds back to 1910 or 1911&#151;the year of Lloyd George&#146;s Budget. Would it have been possible to have foreseen in any way whatever what was going to happen around the time of the death of George VI? It strikes me as very dangerous to legislate or even to attempt to have any idea of what will happen in 40 or 50 years&#146; time. It is impossible to know what will happen the day after tomorrow, let alone in 50 years&#146; time.</p>

My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith made a very good point about the security of oil and other energy supplies, but that is a distraction from the debate on global warming. The talk of global warming is preventing us from thinking logically about the replacement of oil supplies, because perfectly reasonably, with the decline in the North Sea supply, we are not inclined to trust either Arab sheikhs or Russian oligarchs, who are the main source of supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09051350000147"></a>Just recently, there was an announcement that 90 square miles or kilometres&#151;I am sorry; I cannot quite remember which, but it is quite a large area&#151;of the Thames estuary will be covered in wind farms. I am sure that  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is absolutely excellent. The announcement said that those will provide the fuel for 500,000 houses, but it did not say that that is only under perfect wind-blowing conditions. I do not know whether your Lordships are aware of this, but we had a very cold snap this February. The wind stopped because there was a great blodge of immovable high pressure over the United Kingdom, so all those windmills just stood there not moving at all and producing no energy. What an immensely useful investment that is; you invest in 90 square miles or kilometres of windmills to produce no energy when it is very cold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09051350000148"></a>There was an intervention from the Liberal Front Bench about how sea levels were rising by 1.5 metres per whatever it is. The noble Lord is obviously unaware that Flinders University did a test on Tuvalu and found that there was absolutely no movement in sea levels whatever. The instruments that were used were the most modern and sensitive that there have been.</p>

<a name="90513-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09051350000149"></a>I used to think that it was completely logical to believe that, if we chucked buckets of gunge up into the sky, that would have some effect. I thought that people were right about this and that it made sense. Then I read the book written by my noble friend Lord Lawson&#151;I hope that I am not giving it too much of a boost, but there it is&#151;and found the intellectual argument behind it extremely interesting. It has converted me from thinking that one should not do all this damage to asking what harm is being done.</p>

<a name="90513-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09051350000150"></a>We know that CO2 levels have gone up between 1997 and 2007. However, temperatures have not. We know that the other day a test was done on the depth of the Antarctic ice cap and it was found to be rather thicker than everybody thought. We know that in the 1860s one of the Norwegian explorers, Nansen or Amundsen, tried to get through the North-West Passage and found clear water further north in the summer than it was last year. We know that there has been extremely heavy snow in the Himalayas, the Alps and all the big mountain ranges this year and we know that the Arctic ice cap is actually larger this May than it should be.</p>

<a name="90513-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09051350000151"></a>Those are facts. These are not things invented by people; these are documented facts. So have they got it right? I have become, because of the books of my noble friend Lord Lawson and several others, a serious doubter, not because I have any emotional attraction to an idea but because I am presented with a series of facts that make me now think slightly differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09051350000152"></a>The concept of budgeting to spend &#163;400 billion&#151;at that number, one begins to lose all sense of reality&#151;by 2050 because of facts that look to me jolly dodgy does not seem a very sensible thing to do. I know that the Minister will say that it is received scientific knowledge that global warming is happening, but my noble friend has shown that it is not. We ought to be very careful before we go on a spending spree of this magnitude because of something that might happen in the equivalent of the difference between the Parliament Act 1911 and the coronation of our present sovereign.</p>

The Minister recently gave evidence to the European Union Select Committee on the Emissions Trading Scheme and the renewable energy targets. The Select Committee is grateful for that. We intend to publish that evidence for the benefit of the House in due course. My questions are brief. First, can the Minister give your Lordships an assurance that he will use all efforts to ensure that there is a further Statement on energy policy to this House before it rises on 21 July rather than waiting until late October? Secondly, will that Statement include an explanation by Her Majesty&#146;s Government on how we will reach these very challenging renewable energy targets? My noble friend has already referred to the London Array wind farm in the Thames estuary, which I warmly welcome, but there is still a mountain to climb. Finally, the Minister referred to not relying on buying credits under the Emissions Trading Scheme, which I also warmly welcome, but will he say something about certificates of origin and the scheme to purchase some of our obligations on renewable energy from abroad?</p>

I am beginning to think that I have been rehearing some of the stories one heard in the eight years of George Bush&#146;s presidency of the United States. There was a kind of unholy alliance between him and the oil companies to fund an enormous number of scientists to produce evidence, which was clearly in their view fact, that there was no such thing as global warming, the sea was not rising and it was all a big mistake. I do not know which is true. From what I have read, just as many scientists have said that there is a serious problem with global warming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09051350000155"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Leach, quoted a large number of scientists, but in his response to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, he did not explain whether the sea level is rising. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, said that it is not. The noble Lord, Lord Leach, did not deny that it is rising, but he did not explain how it is rising or whether it is due to warmer water and/or the ice cap melting. Perhaps he can do that. I sort of visualise King Canute sitting by the beach waiting for it to happen and when it happens saying, &#147;It is not happening. My feet are not getting wet&#148;. I believe the scientists who say that there is a serious problem with global warming and I welcome what the Government are trying to do about it. They are setting an example with the European Union and, to an extent, other parts of the world. I give my noble friend seven or eight out of 10, which is even more than my noble friend Lord Lea gave him.</p>

The big ice melting was about 12,000 years ago at the end of the last glaciation, which greatly increased sea levels. The more recent increases of about seven inches since the little ice age are thought by the experts to be due to thermal expansion, at which I think the noble Lord hinted. As the seas get a little warmer, they expand. At the moment, that is regarded to be the cause and not ice melting, because it has not melted.</p>

It particularly concerned me when he said that here in the northern hemisphere, anyway, or here in Britain, we are not going to be affected for at least another couple of decades, or a hundred years, or whatever. To me, that is to misunderstand utterly the problem of global warming, in that whether or not it is man-made, if it is happening then there is no way that northern communities will be isolated from migration flows from the inundation in developing nations, or from the changes in ecology and biodiversity that happen with rapid climate change, or from interruptions to trade routes and energy and food security. All of those areas

We will not be able to put up a wall and say, &#147;We&#146;re safe; sorry about the rest of you, but we&#146;re enjoying global warming for the next 200 years and we&#146;ll worry about it after that&#148;. That is not an option; it is a very dangerous thought.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09051350000163"></a>I welcome the fact that the order encompasses all of the greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, which much broadens it out. I know that that came from the Committee on Climate Change; it is a major step forward. I welcome the fact that there are budgets and that they stick pretty well to targets that are, at least, challenging&#151;although on these Benches we believe that we would need quickly to achieve and move toward the larger, intended targets.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09051350000164"></a>A particular area that has interested me, and which was a topic of great debate on the Climate Change Bill, is that of international credits and how they are treated. While I again welcome the fact that the limit on those credits is to be zero, I regret that it is only for the first period&#151;which now goes up only to 2012&#151;and that, even now, we cannot extend that to the next two periods, as it is such an important area. Will the Minister clarify&#151;I did not understand this from the order and it may be that I have not read or understood its meaning properly&#151;whether he specifically said that the Government themselves would not purchase EU ETS units in order to offset?</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09051350000165"></a>The order says that it outlaws clean development mechanism units, but that since the EU ETS operates, those units should be counted. I disagree with that to some degree, but I shall come on to that in a minute. Will the Minister confirm that the Government themselves will not buy EU ETS units&#151;or EUAs, as they are called&#151;so as to close that carbon gap in terms of targets? First, it would be an abuse of how that system works and, secondly, it would be a way in which members of the EU ETS in other parts of Europe might purchase clean development mechanism units that enabled them to sell EUAs to us in Britain. That would effectively make it a carbon-credit laundering system, if one was not careful. I am sure that is not the Government&#146;s intention, but I should be pleased to receive an assurance that the Government will not be counting EU ETS credits toward their own carbon budget.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09051350000166"></a>As the Minister said, it will be interesting to see the Government&#146;s report setting out exactly how these targets are to be met. I agree entirely with the noble Lord that we should include air travel and shipping as soon as possible. It is great to have a definition and I should like to hear from the Minister when he now believes these areas will be brought in. One of the main concerns about shipping was that of international definitions. Has progress been made on those, and similarly in terms of airlines? We know that aviation is going to be included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in 2011, but surely there is still scope to include it in our target now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09051350000167"></a>We welcome the order generally, although we would like to see the credits brought down to zero for all three periods. But the core of the argument in terms of

At a time when the European trading scheme is to some extent floundering again in that we have a slow uptake of renewables and are very dependent on wind, that energy saving has not yet moved forward significantly, that there has been little practical progress on carbon capture and storage and a perhaps understandable hesitation about biofuels, the challenge lies not this order but in the Government&#146;s programme and the programme across Europe to make sure that changes in energy use and how we conserve energy enable us to meet these targets.</p>

We have heard some marvellous contributions to the debate, and no doubt the Minister will want to answer the questions put to him by my noble friends Lord Lawson, Lord Leach, Lord Marlesford, Lord Dixon-Smith, Lord Onslow and Lord Freeman, and those put by the noble Lords, Lord Lea and Lord Berkeley, before he gets around to responding to anything that I might contribute at this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09051350000169"></a>The Climate Change Act 2008 (2020 Target, Credit Limit and Definitions) Order 2009 complies with the provisions of the 2008 Act in setting out the mechanisms for establishing the 2020 emissions target limiting the net amount of carbon units that may be attributed to the UK carbon account and further defines the terms set out in the Act. We cannot but agree with it, and my only question is this. The Conservatives have argued consistently that the expert opinion of the Committee on Climate Change should be the primary driver of climate change policy. Does the Minister support our belief that the majority of carbon reduction activity should be undertaken at home in the United Kingdom so as to offer the maximum competitive advantage to UK businesses rather than simply paying other countries to develop clean technology through the Clean Development Mechanism?</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09051350000170"></a>I turn now to the Carbon Budgets Order 2009. This order complies with the provisions of the 2008 Act in setting the next three budgetary periods: 2008-12, 2013-17 and 2018-20 before the deadline specified by the Act. The carbon budgets set a cap on the maximum level of the net UK carbon account for each five-year period.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09051350000171"></a>I welcome the budgets. During the passage of the Climate Change Bill, we pushed hard to strengthen the Committee on Climate Change, and we urge the Government to heed its advice as far as possible. These carbon budgets provide a major opportunity to United Kingdom business owing to the long-term certainty that they offer. What steps are the Government taking to spur business on to take that leap towards investing in a low carbon future? The third statutory instrument&#151;the Carbon Accounting Regulations 2009&#151;

We are in general agreement with that as well.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09051350000172"></a>I am certain that the Minister will agree that transparency and accountability will be vital to the smooth running of these budgets. Under the Climate Change Act the Secretary of State must ensure that carbon units are kept track of for establishing and maintaining accounts in which carbon units may be held. Provisions are in place to enable the Secretary of State to appoint a body to do this. Can the Minister outline today what progress has been made in appointing such a body? I look forward enormously to hearing him answer all the questions that were put to him by eight noble Lords, let alone from the Front Benches.</p>

I sense that it was a little like a Second Reading debate, and I suspect that some of the arguments this afternoon were deployed during the passage of the Climate Change Act. I was a very late entrant&#151;I dealt with Commons amendments&#151;and I realise that I missed a great deal of splendid debate, a flavour of which we had this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09051350000174"></a>These statutory instruments are important but they are consistent in the context of the Climate Change Act. I was intrigued by the intervention of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who said that the decisions that the House is being asked to make by approving the orders and regulations are committing the Government and the country to action a long time ahead. He referred to Lloyd George&#146;s Budget of 1911, and I was struck by the thought that one of the by-products of that Budget was the first stage of reform of your Lordships&#146; House. I wonder whether they thought then that we would still be debating matters to do with reform.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09051350000175"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. If noble Lords do not accept the consensus, scientific position on climate change, what we are doing would seem to be unnecessary and expensive. If you accept the general consensus and believe that climate change is very likely and that unless we mitigate and adapt there will be catastrophic impacts on the world, the measures before us this afternoon are entirely reasonable. I suspect that we will not agree on that substantive point.</p>

The consensus to which he refers is not a consensus but a majority. There is a wide range of opinions among climate scientists. The majority view, as encapsulated in the IPCC&#146;s report, is that it is very likely that most&#151;not all&#151;of the warming in the last quarter of the 20th century was due to the increase in carbon dioxide emissions. However, there is absolutely no agreement among climate scientists about this being catastrophic. There is nothing in the IPCC&#146;s report about it being catastrophic.

All I can say is that the IPCC&#146;s recent report was written by 690 named scientists and reviewed by another 622. In total, the IPCC&#146;s latest assessment was written by more than 1,250 authors from more than 130 countries and reviewed by an additional 2,500 experts over six years.

The research and analysis continue, we think that the IPCC process is robust. and we will be guided by the best available science. In the mean time, we believe that we should prepare on the basis of the science available to us now.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09051350000182"></a>I enjoyed the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Leach, although I do not necessarily agree with it. He asked me if we had studied Professor Carter&#146;s evidence. My understanding is that we have closely analysed and estimated the cost of emission trading, and we see that as set out in the impact assessment that was published alongside the carbon budget levels announcement on 22 April, to which noble Lords have referred.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09051350000183"></a>The second point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was also made by the noble Lord, Lord Leach: the cost of dealing with climate change, introducing carbon budgets and some of the other changes that have to be made as a result. Of course these figures look very high. A number of noble Lords referred to the noble Lord, Lord Stern, and wished that he were present in our debate&#151;I certainly do&#151;but your Lordships might observe that he has an Oral Question tomorrow  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the whole issue of climate change to which I have the privilege of responding, which will give us all an opportunity to understand where he is coming from. We believe that the noble Lord has done extremely valuable work. He, in his review of the economics of climate change, said that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the cost. Also, the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, was absolutely right to say, of course, that a lot of the costs and investment&#151;if we think of energy policy in particular, given the rundown of many of our existing power stations&#151;would have to take place in any case.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09051350000184"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, first asked me whether we will continue to listen very closely to the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. Yes, the orders reflect that we have taken the advice very seriously. She then made the important point that we want to ensure that the majority of carbon reduction takes place in the UK, rather than the UK having to buy in credits abroad. Also, is UK business in a good place to take advantage of a low-carbon economy? That is a very important point indeed.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09051350000185"></a>I will come in a moment to the lead-up to the negotiations in Copenhagen but, unlike some noble Lords who have spoken, I am optimistic about the outcome of those discussions. I believe it is absolutely clear that the world is on a path towards a low-carbon economy. The question for this country is: are we going to take advantage of that? Are we going to be a country that is at the forefront of technology innovation? Is it going to be British companies which take advantage of that technology lead that we have in many sectors? In the past, we have had the technological lead but have then lost the advantage to other countries; can we ensure that that does not happen again? The noble Baroness has asked one of the most important questions that ought to be before us this afternoon. Clearly, the Budget announcements, and some of the stimulus that has been given towards agreeing a low-carbon economy, are very important in helping British business ensure that we are at the forefront of leading towards a low-carbon economy.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09051350000186"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, asked me about negotiations, and he is rather more pessimistic than I am about the possibility of a deal. To clear up any confusion, I should say that in the orders we are debating interim budgets. Those are being set before a global deal is reached. If we are successful with a global deal, we will then ask the advice of the Committee on Climate Change about tightening the targets&#151;the budgets&#151;that have been set. Clearly, we very much hope that there will be a deal, that the advice of the Committee on Climate Change is indeed to tighten the budgets, and that I will have the honour of bringing further orders before your Lordships&#146; House to put that into practice. How confident are we about a deal in Copenhagen? Well, progress is being made. It is clear that the US Administration have signalled positive moves in helping towards a deal. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State was recently in China in discussion with the Chinese Government, and it would be fair to say that he feels a sense of confidence about our ability to come to international agreement. Of

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09051350000187"></a>The international architecture is an important issue. I do not know the details of the DfID report, but I will certainly ensure that I study it closely. The noble Lord would expect me to say that we work closely across government, and of course we do. I can tell him that the international architecture is vital; it is important to ensure the integrity of any dealings in relation to international credits. Part of the agreement in Copenhagen will be about the actions that developed countries have to take, but it will also be about the actions that emerging countries have to take. However, we hope also that the vulnerable, poorer countries will commit to a low-carbon world. The international architecture that follows from that to ensure the integrity of the system as a whole will be vital.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09051350000188"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, asked me about the definition of nuclear energy. In his not uncritical speech about the Government&#146;s record, I detected at least some acknowledgement of the Government&#146;s go-ahead for new nuclear energy in this country. He knows that the definition is quite straightforward. It is not defined as renewable in international definition terms, but the carbon emissions surrounding nuclear development are very low indeed. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on that point. It seems to me to be a rather theological issue, but there is no doubt that nuclear energy will have a very important role to play in the future.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09051350000189"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, referred to the announcement made only yesterday about major investment in wind farms in the London Array wind park, and he implied criticism. In any number of questions I have answered about renewable energy, noble Lords have complained that companies were not prepared to invest in renewables. We should rejoice that the announcement from E.ON came yesterday. Of course, it is an energy that is intermittent, and that is why you need back-up from other sources of energy. But in any case, noble Lords have consistently argued that we need a diversity of supply alongside&#151;I was going to say &#147;the dash for renewables&#148;; it certainly will be a dash if we are to meet the 2020 targets. That is why we are glad to see the development of new nuclear energy and are delighted about the package of announcements around coal and CCS.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09051350000190"></a>I well understand the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, in saying that as regards the announcement to be made in the summer, he hopes that &#147;summer&#148; will be defined as being before the Summer Recess and that a Statement will be made in your Lordships' House. He will know that I cannot absolutely commit myself to that, but as I hope I implied in committee, I take his point&#151;although perhaps I did not imply that as I was rather cautious about defining the Department of Energy and Climate Change&#146;s &#147;summer&#148;. I certainly hope we achieve that.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09051350000191"></a>As regards coal and CCS, I am not ducking the questions that the noble Lord asked me but we are working on many of those matters. We will make further detailed announcements in the summer on how we are to take CCS forward. Given that coal is  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>responsible for some 40 per cent of electricity generation globally, those of us who believe that we have to take climate change seriously consider that carbon capture and storage is absolutely essential to achieve the targets that we have set. It also offers huge possibilities for the UK. With the announcement of up to four pilot programmes, we have a wonderful opportunity to develop UK technology and export it to many parts of the world. I am delighted that we made the relevant announcement two weeks ago.</p>

<a name="90513-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09051350000192"></a>Of course, this comes with a cost; there is no point in running away from that. I well understand the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Lea that these measures might have an undue impact on poorer people. I agree with him that it is absolutely essential that we consider the impacts of different measures to help meet carbon budgets, including their distribution across society. Of course, we wish to build social equity into all our policy-making. The impact assessment of the proposed budget levels assessed the impact of fuel bills on individuals and businesses. When we publish details of our proposals and policies for meeting the budget in the summer, we will consider these impacts in greater detail, including their effects on different groups in society. I believe that the creation of the new Department of Energy and Climate Change has allowed us to think carefully about needs in terms of creating a fairer society. This very much comes to the fore in relation to energy and climate change policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09051350000193"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to my next point. Energy saving constitutes a great part of moving towards a low-carbon economy. The challenge for us is to ensure that energy-saving proposals are more successful. This can have a very good impact on many poorer people if we ensure that measures are properly targeted.</p>

However, it is widely understood that, in supporting the noble Lord, Lord Stern, the Government agree that the economy will continue to grow but at a slightly lower rate&#151;in the order of 1 per cent slower&#151;than if there had been no other constraint, including climate change. Will my noble friend note that that is a separate but important consideration? We are seeing how a 1 per cent change in GDP affects employment. An undertaking needs to be given that that, too, will be subject to further analysis and tracking. Although it sounds like a small figure, it is not inconsiderable if we all agree that the general rate of economic growth in terms of productive potential is adrift by 1 per cent.</p>

Secondly, and more importantly, of course the Minister hopes that there will be a satisfactory&#151;from his point of view&#151;agreement in Copenhagen, but even he must accept that there may not be. A satisfactory agreement in Copenhagen would see all other countries in the developed world pursuing the reduction targets, and the developing world pursuing maybe slightly lesser targets.

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09051350000204"></a>Of course, there is much more work that needs to be done. We will develop carbon budgets in relation to what it means for government and the impact on policies. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that we will continue to take the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. As she suggested, alongside the mitigation policies, there is a huge challenge on adaptation. The names of the members of the adaptation sub-committee will be announced very soon. We very much look forward to the advice that they will be able to give to the Government directly and to the committee.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09051350000207"></a>As far back as 1997, it was apparent that the clamping of vehicles parked on private land was becoming a serious problem, because the law was not fit for purpose, and that is still the case 12 years later. If anything, the problem is getting worse. The short answer to my Question in respect of the SIA is &#147;not very much&#148; because it does not have the power. The Government for their part have belatedly issued a consultation, which I will turn to later. Before getting into detail, I should make it clear that I fully accept that there is a need for legitimate parking controls, including clamping&#151;for example, at a doctor&#146;s surgery next to a convenience store or a pub with inadequate parking provision.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09051350000208"></a>I apologise if I tar these operations with a very black and broad brush, but my target is those parasitic operators who prey on vulnerable motorists who are ill equipped to defend themselves. These are the decent, hard working and skilled men and women who go about their business but have to use a vehicle extensively. The release, tow-away and storage charges are disproportionate because they are unregulated by the law and are often much more than the statutory removal fees set by the Minister and his department. Moreover, the statutory removal fees are based upon vehicle recovery operations, pressure of time and 24/7 availability, but parking control operations are much simpler and less costly.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09051350000209"></a>The Government introduced the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the PSIA, but this was primarily concerned with the private security industry, club bouncers and the like. However, it provided that an individual involved in vehicle immobilising, known as a VI, has to be licensed by the Security Industry Authority. The SIA is not an appeal body and malpractice is outside its remit. The appeal mechanism lies within the company alleged to be at fault, but there is no requirement for the company to be registered or approved in any way. The SIA is obviously not as well resourced as it would like to be, and its problem is that 1 per cent of its licensed members are VIs, but this generates 25 per cent of its parliamentary correspondence and at least 70 Parliamentary Questions per year. That cannot be a lot of fun for the SIA. If a motorist complains to the police, they will say it is a civil matter and decline to get involved. The police are right because they have no powers, but it is extremely damaging to their reputation among decent, hard working members of the public.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09051350000210"></a>For the past 12 years, the Government have completely failed to deal with this problem, leaving the most industrious and vulnerable members of our society exposed to the following problems: inadequate or misleading signage that sometimes leads motorists to park where they should not; the size of the release and tow-away fees, coupled with the curious reluctance of VI companies to take payment by means of a card&#151;I wonder why they do that&#151;immediate clamping or towing away without exercising any discretion; operatives refusing to identify themselves, leading one to suspect that a number of them are unlicensed; operatives luring people to park, or intimidating them for payment; the SIA&#146;s lack of powers against these types of conduct; and the clamping of vehicles that should never be clamped because of their use.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09051350000211"></a>There is also a new problem concerning the use of cameras and the complicity of the DVLA, which seems to have a policy of releasing as much private information as possible. This help from the DVLA results in unsophisticated motorists being sent a document that is made to look like a fine originating from the Government or their agents, but is more likely to have come from a parasite.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09051350000212"></a>Ministers belatedly recognised the problem and issued a consultation paper on 30 April this year. The Minister will have seen some dodgy staff work in his time, but I am sure that this paper can take pride of place in his black museum. It is well drafted, but it demonstrates that Ministers and the Government have a complete lack of comprehension of the scale, nature and effect of clamping.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09051350000213"></a>The paper is full of holes. For instance, it is predicated on the fact that there are only 1,900 licensed VIs. Elsewhere, it notes that some VIs refuse to identify themselves. A recent GfK NOP survey commissioned by the RAC Foundation suggested that between 8 and 12 per cent of households have had at least one vehicle clamped on private land. This, coupled with the amount of parliamentary activity, suggests that the 1,900 licensed VIs are amazingly active. A more likely explanation is that the problem is much bigger than the Government recognise.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09051350000214"></a>The paper offers only four options. The first is to do nothing, an option that should always be considered. The second is a voluntary code of practice, which is more or less what we have now. The third is regulation by a business licensing system, which apparently is the preferred option. However, this is a cosy cartel set up and run by the parking industry for its own benefit. Where is the independent tribunal component? Since depriving a person of their freedom of movement is a serious matter, there should be a proper and genuinely independent appeals mechanism. The fourth option is a compulsory approved contractor scheme. A voluntary scheme is in place, but only five companies are in it. My guess is that the SIA does not want any greater involvement than running the licensing system, as the regulatory and appeals side is seen as a poisoned chalice.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09051350000215"></a>I am sure that the Minister, like me, will wonder why the paper did not consider other options. A permit could be issued by the local authority, which would introduce a strong element of local democratic checks and balances, to ensure that parking controls are necessary in the location applied for. On the same tack, should it be legal for a VI company to pay a landowner for the right to exercise parking controls? This is happening more often, and the incidence will increase further as premises with parking fall out of use. Another option might be to use the parking appeals tribunal currently used for resolving on-street parking appeals.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09051350000216"></a>The partial impact assessment is just that. It looks closely at the costs to the VI industry, but not at the costs to the motorist and his employer, or the adverse effect on productivity. It is also predicated on a very low number of VIs and VI companies.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09051350000217"></a>This is a sorry tale of ineffective government. The consultation is full of holes and demonstrates that the Government do not fully understand the impact of

There is now not enough time to effect any changes before the end of this Parliament. That is bad for all the stakeholders: the property owners, the respectable VIs and parking companies and, above all, the motorists.</p>

He ended by saying that there is not enough time in this Parliament to introduce any regulations. I am not sure whether that is a threat or a promise, and if his party by some fluke wins the next election I will be interested to see how quickly it introduces the right regulations, but that is for the future.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09051350000219"></a>This is a serious example of a part of the motor industry that is wholly unregulated. It is almost the law of the jungle. That worries me, because attitudes in one area, such as the issue of parking, which we are discussing tonight, will have an effect on the attitude of motorists to other issues. The Government have done a good job in the past few years in encouraging motorists to obey the law, whether on speeding, drink-driving or drivers&#146; hours. We are getting better, but there is still a long way to go with some trucks.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09051350000220"></a>I was talking to a former director of VOSA recently, who told the story of some checks that he was doing on truck drivers going between Ireland and eastern Europe. The company sacked all the Irish drivers and replaced them with eastern European drivers and paid them &#163;2.50 or &#163;3 an hour. If they stopped for a rest&#151;which of course is statutory&#151;they were charged the same rate per hour as if they had been in a hotel, because they were not moving. The consequence of driving for 36 hours without any rest or sleep is extremely serious.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09051350000221"></a>VOSA is doing better; it needs to do an awful lot more. The point is the difference between what motorists expect and what they get when they obey the law as laid down by the Government, agencies and local authorities&#151;what motorists expect and often get, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, when they try off-street parking. The stories abound of serious problems. As the noble Earl said, the Security Industry Authority licenses individuals, so when you complain to the company, the company says that it has nothing to do with it. Often the company allegedly in charge of the parking employs a subcontractor. Motorists wonder who they should appeal to. There are stories of companies saying, &#147;You cannot appeal until you have paid the fine in the first place&#148;. That is the usual business of people being guilty until they have tried to demonstrate their innocence. It is not even an independent appeal. Something needs to be done to sort out that process.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09051350000222"></a>We have had a lot of debate in your Lordships' House recently about the police not always having their numbers on display. My noble friend has made some positive and welcome comments about that. It is perfectly reasonable that private sector people who operate these parking lots should have some identification that means something. We have even greater trouble with CCTV, because there will be no contact between the motorist and the company until the motorist receives a nasty letter through the post saying, &#147;You were seen there and it will cost you a lot of money&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09051350000223"></a>I hope that my noble friend can help me with this. The Transport Select Committee produced what appears to be a very robust recommendation in its report. It basically says that the whole process should be governed,</p>
<ul><a name="09051350000241"></a>&#147;by the same framework of restrictions and codes of practice as public on-street clamping. The Government should ensure an equable legal framework including public roads and private land used by the public for parking, which will stamp out these abuses&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051350000232"></a>That clearly refers to both the private sector operators and the public sector ones as well.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09051350000224"></a>I conclude by commending, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has done, the organisation that deals with parking appeals in London. I had reason to appeal a few years ago to this organisation about something which my son had done. It turned on whether a parking restriction on a particular road was applicable on Sunday. It is an example to follow. It was very easy; it was quick and convenient. You felt that it was absolutely fair&#151;they listened to your evidence and to the evidence from the local authority; I presented a photograph of the road sign, which said parking was not forbidden on Sunday, and we got the answer. It is not a very difficult thing to do and I do not imagine it costs very much. However, it would give confidence to motorists that they were going to be treated fairly&#151;they would behave better and it would give the industry a good name. I do hope that my noble friend will consider that when he responds.</p>

My interest in the SIA is not so much to do with private clampers but with bailiffs, whom it is also due to regulate. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, will be speaking in the gap, although it seems not, which is sad, as she seems to be making some good progress in getting the SIA under control. It was not the best of regulators before she arrived. It suffers from the great deficit that it cannot deal with complaints but just regulates. You cannot, as has been demonstrated by my noble friend, have a system of regulation and registration without having a complaints system, with teeth, tied in with it in some way.</p>

<a name="90513-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09051354000002"></a>The SIA could say that we will not register a clamper unless it belongs to a reputable organisation that has a proper complaints and adjudication procedure so that something is made available for motorists who get stuck in this way. That does not seem to be difficult. You have that point of impact on people when you give them a licence. If they have not signed up to a complaints procedure then you do not give them a licence. That does not require any legislation or any changes. It requires someone to have the courage to say that, &#147;Yes you, the British Parking Association&#148;&#151;which after all is a thoroughly reputable organisation&#151;&#147;is running a complaints and disciplinary procedure that we are happy to go along with, and being a member of that process would tick the box&#148;. That seems to be a lot simpler than trying to create something statutory, or, worse still, trying to run a complaints system through the department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09051354000003"></a>I was interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said about the appeals procedures for ordinary&#151;as one might call them&#151;public sector tickets. I do not think they are actually that satisfactory. The whole appeals procedure is not allowed to listen to common sense. It has very restricted grounds for appeal and there is immense inefficiency in some local authorities. Camden sends tens of thousands of people to bailiffs every year because of parking tickets, mostly because of its own inefficiency in contacting those people in the first place and its own rapacity in setting up traps for motorists where there should be none. It is not an elegant and perfect system in the public sector either.</p>

In particular, it is not allowed to pay any attention to common sense; it just has a set of six very restricted grounds on which it can allow an appeal. I am glad that the noble Lord came within that set, but many people with many good cases do not because of the way in which it has been set up.</p>

Although he was fined and not clamped, his letter to Premier Parking Solutions, which is managed by Valley Enforcement Limited, makes some of the important points that I would have made, and I am grateful to him for having done the homework, albeit unintentionally, for this debate. He wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09051354000015"></a>&#147;Your sign warns of penalties for overstay; but &#163;100 for a very short overstay after a five hour period of paid for parking seem to me to be grossly disproportionate, and if it was to be enforced at that level then it should be backed by very prominent signage. What is the basis of this charge, and is it backed by a statutory order? If so where can I inspect such an order? I can find no trace of it in the public domain. If I am satisfied that it is properly legally enforceable, then of course I shall pay. If it is not, then I shall offer you a nominal sum in damages for my overstay of say &#163;10 and then dispute any demand for further payment in Courts. I have copied this to the Environment Director at Devon County Council and the Leader of the City Council as this kind of practice could seriously damage Exeter&#146;s reputation as a tourist and business destination&#148;.</p>

I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred to my noble friend Lady Walmsley, who had to go to extraordinary lengths to prove how unfair the system was. She did the public a service in doing that. There is a widespread feeling, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, that the hardworking individual who tries to do their best to be law abiding is at a significant disadvantage in every way because this is not regulated or taken seriously.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09051354000010"></a>The Government will complain about the lack of time in which to do something about this, but there is plenty of time this evening as the House will run out of business very shortly. I remind the Minister that just a few weeks ago we in this House considered a statutory instrument to update the legislation on the SIA, so it is possible to do something. The Government have been aware for some time that when the SIA was introduced in 2001 it was not given the necessary powers to limit these sorts of activities and that there is not even a code of conduct. Those issues could have been addressed in the SI that we were talking about recently.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09051354000011"></a>The scale of the clamping industry is enormous. I gather it is in the region of &#163;240 million a year, so this is not just small beer. It is something that I should have thought the Government would be very anxious to get to grips with, given its effect on individuals. I would particularly like the Minister to comment on the role of the DVLA in all this. Should it actually co-operate with the private companies operating in a most unsatisfactory way&#151;or even if they were operating in a satisfactory way, should it co-operate? Do Her Majesty&#146;s Government have a policy on this? Does the Minister feel that it is satisfactory?</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09051354000012"></a>The Government themselves could do a large amount to resolve the situation, but some of it is what other speakers have mentioned: the fact of the signage; the fact that very often the private car park operators try to make their car park look as like a public one as possible, I would say in order to deceive people, so they think that the same rules apply, when in fact they do not.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09051354000013"></a>What would the Liberal Democrats do? For some time now we have had a firm policy that was documented in our <I>Fast Track Britain</I>. In that publication we say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09051354000016"></a>&#147;We will tackle abuses of power, poor standards and unfair appeals procedures in relation to car parking. We will regulate the parking system and increase confidence in Local Authority Parking Enforcement by creating an &#145;Independent Parking Complaints Authority&#146;...to act as a regulator for all car parks over 10 spaces and be responsible for policing the standards for all parking facilities and decriminalised parking enforcement&#151;including appeals processes, adequate lighting and public safety provision, disabled parking provision and adequate signage of fines. The IPCA remit will include applications for the blue badge scheme and the implementation and management of this scheme. The IPCA will recognise those car parks meeting the required standards by awarding a kite mark. The IPCA will replace the Traffic Penalty Tribunal which does not tackle private car parks, and it will be funded by a levy on all car park operators&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051354000014"></a>I commend that policy to the Minister and I urge him to find parliamentary time to take forward the suggestions made in this debate because it is a serious issue for all of the individuals who have been so unfairly treated&#151;people who have had their cars towed away, people

It touches on an issue which is of great interest to many members of the public, as we know from the number of letters that have been written and other contacts that have been made, as well as to many Members of this House, those who have spoken in this debate and the other place.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09051355000002"></a>It is an issue that needs to be addressed. There are a lot of problems within this area, and I am glad to say that we are beginning to address them. It was also good that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, pointed out that that we need some regulation of private space, such as where there is a doctor&#146;s surgery and a supermarket close by. I can think of things such as rugby matches when spaces being filled are actually for other purposes, so it is quite right and appropriate to have a method by which people can ensure that their private land is not used if they do not want that to happen and, if they are willing to let other people use it, they should have some control. It is absolutely right that we should do something about this in primary legislation; we intend to legislate as soon as possible in the next Session.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09051355000003"></a>The role of the Security Industry Authority is to regulate the private security industry in Great Britain under the Private Security Industry Act 2001; it reports to the Home Secretary. The 2001 Act requires the compulsory licensing of individuals undertaking designated activities. Under the Act, any individual in England and Wales involved in immobilising vehicles on private land&#151;the noble Earl referred to these people as vehicle immobilisers, VIs&#151;with a view to charging a release fee must hold a licence issued for the purpose from the SIA. This requirement also applies to anyone involved in blocking in or towing away vehicles for the same purpose, and to those who collect the fee. Directors, managers and company owners also require a licence, which is known as a &#147;non-front line&#148; licence. Licensing by the SIA will be extended to Northern Ireland on 1 December 2009. This does not apply to Scotland, which has separate laws on this issue.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09051355000004"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, it is important to make it clear that the SIA is not involved where the owner of a vehicle which has been clamped or removed from private land disputes the justification for that action. Unless some criminal action is alleged it is a matter between the vehicle owner and those responsible for the clamping or towing. This has been touched on by a number of speakers and it is one of the problems. One feels at the mercy of these people and it is extremely difficult to get something done. I have been involved in an interesting debate with someone who tried to charge me on this sort of occasion. This is a very real issue.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09051355000005"></a>The SIA licence requirement for individuals was aimed at excluding criminals. Of course, criminals have been involved. There have been cases where criminals  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been caught and taken through due process of law for their involvement. There has also been unacceptable behaviour by individuals. However, while it has gone some way to ensuring good practice, it has been made clear by other speakers and the noble Earl that there remains a significant level of bad practice among some vehicle immobilisation businesses. I thank the noble Earl again for this debate because I certainly had not put my eyes on this issue and looked at it in any detail. I have found that quite useful.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09051355000006"></a>At the request of Ministers, however&#151;it was announced by my honourable friend Vernon Coaker in February 2008, more than a year ago&#151;the SIA completed a feasibility study into regulating businesses in the industry. On the basis of its proposals we launched a public consultation on 30 April, to which reference has been made already. We want to curb the unacceptable practices of some businesses, over which the individual worker will probably have no or perhaps little control, such as exorbitant release fees, which a number of speakers have touched on. We need to put some balance behind that, and set some principles and top lines on what can be charged. On inadequate signage, to which reference has been made already, sometimes not only is the signage inadequate and it is unclear that one has to pay anything, but people are lulled into thinking that they can park for no or little fees. That is wrong as well and needs to be looked at. The noble Baroness referred to her husband and to parking in Exeter. I did not realise that these things happen in the West Country. I understood that they do in London, but it is terrible if it goes on down there.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09051355000007"></a>Immediate clamping and towing away is unacceptable. If a person is two or three minutes over their time, suddenly being clamped or towed away is absolutely inappropriate. We need to look at that. The fact that wheel-clampers do not identify themselves is not correct and is not allowed. They should identify themselves, but sometimes they do not. Indeed, that was the main thrust of my debate with a gentleman on this issue. Nor should people be lured to park where they will be clamped.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09051355000008"></a>Our preferred option is compulsory membership of a licensing scheme for vehicle immobilising businesses. A third party accrediting body would be contracted by the SIA to decide whether each company which applied for a licence met the scheme&#146;s requirements. The SIA would remain as the regulator. The accrediting body, or bodies, would decide whether a business which applied for a licence met the requirements for qualification. It would also be responsible for monitoring all licensed companies to check their compliance with the scheme&#146;s requirements. Failure to comply could result in the SIA removing the business&#146;s licence or taking other action to secure compliance.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09051355000009"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, talked about the DVLA. I understand that there is a concern here. This is really Department for Transport business, but, as I understand it, the DVLA has always taken the view that disclosure of data where there is a breach of civil or contract law is fair and reasonable. Tracing people who do not comply with the conditions for parking on private land is regarded in most  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>circumstances as a reasonable cause. However, there are strict rules. For example, before being granted electronic access to DVLA records, a company must be a member of a DVLA-accredited trade association, and abide by its code of practice. The only trade association currently accredited for the private car park industry is the British Parking Association.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09051355000010"></a>The Government have just launched a consultation that seeks views on the DVLA making keeper data available, whether electronically or manually, only to parking enforcement companies that are members of an approved trade association. We need to look at that area carefully within this consultation, because there is clearly something wrong if fines and so on are put out as if they come from the DVLA. That absolutely must not be allowed.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09051355000011"></a>The noble Earl talked about partial impact assessment; this is a draft, and we need the comments received during the consultation to help refine the costs and benefits. The detail will be decided after that consultation; any inputs will be gratefully received, because there are some important issues here. The information received during the consultation will be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09051355000012"></a>I think that I have touched on how the proposals on business licensing, which the noble Earl specifically asked about, differ from the current arrangements. To run through them again, the issues, which we will decide on after public consultation, include: excessive penalties for releasing clamped cars; impounding cars unreasonably quickly; inadequate signage; an effective appeals process, which is important and has been touched on, and luring cars into car parks by any means.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09051355000013"></a>The noble Earl also asked whether the Government could require local authorities to license private parking. Even if they did, it would require some business standards to be imposed. The real question is: who is in a position to do that, or has access to the necessary expertise? There is a danger that local authority licensing might just impose a layer of bureaucracy; that is something we need to look at in the consultation, as it might not be the right way ahead. There would also be the possibility of local authorities having competing and differing priorities at local level, depending on circumstances. I imagine that Twickenham would be very different from say, Wargrave, out in the Thames Valley.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09051355000014"></a>The noble Earl specifically asked how the scheme will be enforced. Our preferred option is that businesses failing to comply with their licence conditions will be subject to sanctions. Exactly what those are, we will have to decide in the context of this consultation. The SIA will have powers to revoke or suspend a company&#146;s licence if it is found to be breaching the conditions. There will also be specific criminal offences connected to working without a company licence or breaching licence conditions. From what has been said, people probably feel it is important that we can achieve that to get control. The detail of those offences will be determined as part of this consultation process.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09051355000015"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley asked again about clampers. I touched on that and if clamping happens at night people sometimes feel intimidated. They cannot prove who has done it and do not know if they have a  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>licence. It is clear that clampers must wear the licence when doing that, although the chap I had a discussion with was not, and that any licence-holder who collects a fee must provide a receipt, showing the location, the date and their own name, signature and licence number. If someone suspects that a person involved in immobilising or towing vehicles does not possess a licence or is failing to follow the rules they should report it to the SIA, as it is a criminal offence. I quite understand what the noble Earl was saying; if a single woman is parking somewhere, it is sometimes quite difficult to ascertain those things. However, that is probably about as far as we can go, as it is a criminal offence which would then have to be taken through due process of law.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09051355000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, mentioned bailiffs, which is, of course, a matter for the Ministry of Justice. As I understand it, the details are being developed but an appeals process will be introduced. He also asked about the appeals process; it is part of the consultation, and I touched on it before. The scheme will prohibit employees or representatives from engaging in unacceptable practices, make them more accountable and require a transparent appeals system. The scheme should also include general and sector-specific licence conditions. We will have to be clear on what is laid down because these are not easy areas.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09051355000017"></a>My message is this: we take this issue seriously. Perhaps we have taken too long to react, although we started the process a year ago last February. It is something that needs to be focused on and any input into the consultation will be extremely valuable. I hope that, with the consultation and the legislation which will be introduced in the next Session, we can take a good step forward. It is a worrying issue and sometimes leads to quite difficult situations, as I discovered myself. I hope that we can move it forward.</p>

While the quantity of contributors is not great, I am confident we shall hear comments of great quality from the noble Lord, Lord Howell, the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, who is to speak in the gap, my noble friend Lord Shutt and the Minister. I must declare an interest as one of the officers of the All-Party St Helena Group chaired by Bob Russell MP. Like him, I am one of very few parliamentarians to have visited St Helena. I did so in 2003 as a member of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation accompanied by John Smith MP and Anthony Steen MP, while valuable administrative and seafaring assistance was given by Paul Jackson, the deputy secretary of the CPA UK Branch and a former commander in the Royal Navy.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09051355000019"></a>One of the facts we learned was that no government Minister has ever visited the island. Members of the Royal Family have, and we visited the Prince Andrew School. My noble friend Lord Shutt will have more to say about educational opportunities on St Helena. The reason that no Minister has visited is that it takes such a long time to get there. Currently there is no airport and the only scheduled transport available is by the RMS &#147;St Helena&#148;, the last remaining Royal Mail ship in operation. Occasionally cruise liners venture near the island, but for insurance reasons their passengers are often not allowed to disembark if the swell is too great.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09051355000020"></a>The RMS can transport 120 passengers and a limited amount of freight. There is no wharf on St Helena so disembarking is fraught with excitement. As a result of the difficulty of getting to and from St Helena, the island has no effective economy. As a British Overseas Territory, it is entirely dependent on an increasing subsidy from the British Treasury, the largest of any overseas territory. Over the last 25 years, the taxpayer has given St Helena more than a quarter of a billion pounds. Unless something changes, that sum will be significantly larger over the next 25 years.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09051355000021"></a>Due to the lack of employment opportunities on the island, many Saints, as they like to be called, have sought work elsewhere. I met some of the 600 or so Saints in the Falklands when I visited last year. There are several hundred on Ascension Island, one of St Helena&#146;s dependencies, along with the even more remote Tristan da Cunha. There are thousands of Saints in the United Kingdom with particular clusters in Reading, Swindon and Southampton, and we have 20 or so in my former constituency of Cheltenham. The local college, now part of the University of Gloucestershire, had an educational link with St Helena stretching back over several decades. We trained teachers from St Helena, some of whom went back to the island while others stayed in the UK, married and brought up families here. I met the Cheltenham Saints before I visited St Helena in 2003. Without exception, they wanted to go back to the island, either to retire, to settle with their families or at least to be able to spend their holidays there. With no airport that is simply not possible. Many noble Lords will know that one of the Doorkeepers along the corridor is a Saint who has not been back to the island in more than 20 years. This brings in a related issue of frozen pensions, but that is a debate for another day.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09051355000022"></a>To reach St Helena it is necessary to start from Cape Town in South Africa or Walvis Bay in Namibia. There one embarks on the RMS and sails for five days. The Atlantic Ocean is a very large expanse of water. There is nothing but ocean all around. You go to bed, sleep, wake up and there is still ocean, nothing but ocean, day after day after day. Eventually you reach the island, disembark, spend 56 hours there, some of it sleeping, and then embark again for the voyage to Ascension Island, another two days at sea. That schedule is simply not feasible for tourists or those wanting to spend regular holidays there to see families and friends. With very small numbers of visitors, it is impossible to sustain a tourist industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09051355000023"></a>Following the CPA visit in 2003, we had a debate on St Helena in Westminster Hall, when I said that the island needed three things: airport, airport and airport. Actually, it needs only one thing. All three of us who visited the island agreed that an airport was needed, which is something that has been talked about and consulted on for decades. A referendum among islanders showed 72 per cent in favour of air access.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09051355000024"></a>It was a great delight to learn just before the previous general election that the Government had decided to build the airport. The then Secretary of State for International Development, Hilary Benn, made the announcement and I recall meeting him in a Corridor and congratulating him warmly. An environmental impact assessment was carried out and the project received a clean bill of health. Of particular relevance was the situation of indigenous species on St Helena, including the wirebird or, to give it its Latin name, charadrius sanctaehelenae. I have my St Helena National Trust wirebird adoption certificate, as I am now the proud adoptive parent of a wirebird with a unique identification number, NW44532. I hope to meet it one day.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09051355000025"></a>An invitation to tender to build the airport was issued and received no bids. Another invitation to tender was issued changing the terms to include government payment for island visits. Four expressions of interest were received, two of which dropped out at a later stage. Two companies produced compliant bids to build the airport, the Basil Read Group based in South Africa, and the Italian-based Impregilo. After a long evaluation Impregilo&#146;s was selected as the preferred bid. Then last December, the Government announced a pause in negotiations. Later, yet another consultation was announced which is ongoing. The last consultation showed undisputedly that an airport is necessary to give St Helena any chance of becoming self-sufficient financially. That is still the case so this consultation is regarded by many as no more than an expensive time-wasting exercise.</p>

<a name="90513-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09051355000026"></a>The new consultation&#146;s options are: first, to build the airport now; secondly, to not build the airport at all; or, thirdly, to wait five years before making a decision. I understand the current financial difficulties in which Governments find themselves, but there are reports from Mr George Soros and other experienced commentators of green shoots of recovery breaking out. Hanging around for years to build St Helena&#146;s airport makes no sense. Not building it at all will lead to an ever increasing subsidy to the island year on year, and any delay is likely to lead to an increase in the cost of building the airport and the possibility of losing potential private sector investors who are keen to develop a tourist industry for St Helena. Frankly, who would enter a new bidding round after the shenanigans of the current process?</p>

Around the world many people are interested in Napoleon. I am told that in the United States of America there are 4 million Nap nuts, as they are called, let alone those in the French-speaking world who want to see where he lived. St Helena need attract only a tiny fraction of these people to visit perhaps just once to fill every hotel and guest house on the island.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09051355000028"></a>Napoleon is not the only reason for visiting St Helena. Anglers and divers will also find extraordinary attractions. There are 1,100 shipwrecks around St Helena&#151;a diver&#146;s paradise. The island was, of course, the place where ships called in to replenish stocks of fresh food and water during the days of the East India Company. The island has a wide variety of fish for sea anglers, which is a growing leisure activity. There are many varieties of birds&#151;not just the St Helena wirebird&#151;for the ornithologist. There are also a number of historic sites, many of which need refurbishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09051355000029"></a>I talked about inward investment. There are potential investors, most particularly a consortium called Shelco. I have seen its plans for the most environmentally sensitive hotel in the world, not just in operational matters but in building materials, designed by the architect Jeremy Blake of Purcell Miller Tritton. It promises to be a landmark in sustainable tourism, using wind and solar power and growing its own fruit and vegetables, something St Helena used to do in abundance.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09051355000030"></a>Other investors wish to help develop a thriving tourist industry, including some Saints who have already gone back and started to refurbish buildings that could be used as small hotels or guest houses. The problem is that none of this will happen until the airport is built. Has the Minister any idea how long this pause in negotiations will last, and is he confident that the preferred bidder, Impregilo, will stay in the frame with its current bid at the current price?</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09051355000031"></a>The consultation document&#146;s figures seem to present the worst-case scenario, with spending for several years all bundled into a single total. If the airport were given the go-ahead now, what would be the cost in each of the financial years 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12, by which time Impregilo plans to have finished the airport?</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09051355000032"></a>What has been the outcome of recent communications between the Government and Shelco, or with any other private sector companies? Have there been any meetings, and has there been any discussion of private sector assistance with the costs of building the airport?</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09051355000033"></a>It is difficult to imagine a French overseas territory suffering like St Helena. Have the Government made any application to the European Union for assistance in funding the airport? What about the UK&#146;s responsibilities under the UN charter, which says that the UK has special obligations to our overseas territories, and the Government&#146;s claims in their own White Paper that overseas territories have first call on DfID funds to meet &#147;reasonable&#148; needs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09051355000035"></a>The Government made the right decision in 2005 to build an airport on St Helena. It is now time to deliver on that promise, give the Saints the chance to develop a thriving economy and put right decades of neglect by successive British Governments. I hope that the Minister will give some encouragement to these remarkable people and ensure that a government Minister will, at last, visit St Helena to gain first-hand knowledge of conditions on the island and the difficulties of getting there.</p>

I hope, in view of the time, that I will be permitted a little longer than would be normal, because I want to follow up what has been said: that this decision has been awaited by St Helena and it thought it had got it. It has been waiting for it for nine years, to put this into context. Last December, as has been said, we were told that there would be a delay, and we knew that there was an economic crisis. Now we are being told that there will be a further delay until, I gather, July, although some say it may be the turn of the year before a decision is made.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09051355000037"></a>What are the three options? First, to go ahead with the airport; secondly, not to go ahead with it but to commission a new ship, which will take another five years; or, thirdly, to delay any decision for five years. The economic circumstances of the island cannot take that kind of delay. Already the people who are required on the island&#151;the young people, the working people&#151;are leaving. That leaves, as has been said, an island of either very young children or very elderly citizens.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09051355000038"></a>This airport was going to be the lifeline. It might be costly&#151;all airports are costly wherever you build them, that is true. Nevertheless, if the island is going to be self-sufficient, if the people who live on it are going to have any opportunity for a future and indeed if the island is going to retain people at all, the airport is absolutely necessary. There is no other way around the difficulties, as the noble Lord explained&#151;I have not been myself&#151;of actually going by sea, and the length of time it takes. He described very graphically some of the beauties that can be found on the island, and the points of interest&#151;it was the last resting place of Napoleon, from which he could not escape.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09051355000039"></a>There would be a great deal of interest in St Helena. A lot of tourists would want to go there and development would take place in relation to the hotel. I say to the Minister that, because of the assurances that were given, a lot of people have already invested in the future and they will begin to lose. The people are extremely disillusioned, I must say, at this outcome of events; they have to wait again and they do not even know now whether there is a future&#151;whether the airport will go ahead. A new boat will have to be commissioned if it does not. To wait another five years would absolutely kill it. The people interested in development in the island are not going to hang around for another five years.</p>

That is one of the problems that we are facing&#151;many of the relevant people have not been. My interest is there because I have an interest in overseas territories generally, and I have a great interest in the people of St Helena because the situation that they find themselves in is life or death.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09051355000041"></a>I know that we are not going to get a reply, and that is nothing to do with my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham, because he has been forthright throughout his political career. He is not in a position to say any more to us, except that there is an economic crisis, that we are in the midst of recession, and that the Government cannot commit themselves at this time. But when are they going to commit themselves? That is the position. When are we going to get this answer? We are now told, yes, there could be a decision in July, or it could be the end of the year. There could be a decision not to go ahead. But to say &#147;Another five years&#148; is the end of the road as far as St Helena is concerned. I see my noble friend Lord Gilbert, who is a greater expert than I am on defence, but I would have thought that one of the other advantages of the airport would be that it would add an extra staging post to the aircraft going to the Falklands. That in itself should be invaluable. If we do not go ahead, there is a cost. Already &#147;St Helena&#148;, the ship, is costing roughly &#163;9 million per year. As the Government said, there is a variation in help of about &#163;1.75 million and this is an ongoing cost that will continue. It will continue because we have a commitment to the overseas territory. I think my noble friend would recognise this.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09051355000042"></a>There is disillusionment; people are so disillusioned that they do not know whether to join in the debate. I make an appeal to them: I want them to continue to show their interest and to participate, and to make very clear to the Government that there can only be one answer and that is for the airport to go ahead. I welcome what my noble friend has to say, but I am not very hopeful, and the people of St Helena are not just not hopeful but are losing hope altogether&#151;and that is the real tragedy of this situation. I hope that, although he cannot give an answer, he will press on the Ministers concerned that the lifeblood of the island lies with the airport, and that a decision&#151;a positive decision&#151;to go ahead is required as soon as possible.</p>

He has given us a wonderful historic background from the experience of his visit and from what he has learnt. The debate is not perfect in timing, and perhaps we could have got two dozen people to speak had we had five weeks&#146; notice, but I am delighted that the option has been taken. It is not perfect for me as many of my relevant papers are in Greetland, but it is an important challenge for St Helena. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, was able to speak in the gap as I know much about his interest.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1089"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1089</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>territory but a dependent overseas territory. It is in the same position as Pitcairn and Montserrat; it is in need of significant aid and assistance and it is nowhere near self-sufficient. That is the starting point for a special island and its needs.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09051355000045"></a>The island is two weeks away from Britain. As my noble friend Lord Jones said, we spent 56 hours on St Helena, but deduct 16 hours&#146; sleep and you are left with only 40 hours. It was enough time for me to realise that this was a beautiful place and that it had a very interesting heritage and a welcoming and hospitable people. There was enough time to give me a real understanding of the needs of the people, particularly when added to that was the reading and research both before and after.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09051355000046"></a>The sea journey, leaving from Walvis Bay on a Monday and arriving at St Helena on Friday morning, was an absolutely wonderful experience. And it was a wonderful experience sailing again on Sunday and arriving at Ascension Island on Wednesday morning. It was wonderful and it was romantic, but it is not realistic. This is a place of isolation and restricted resources. Let me give three examples. When we were there, my wife, who came with me, had an alternative tour. She went to the hospital where she saw a scanner not in use. She made inquiries about it&#151;it had arrived the previous September and unfortunately something had happened to it en route. I do not know whether anything has been done about it since, but then no one had been prepared to make the journey to St Helena to mend the scanner. If you think about it, you can understand that, because it takes a fortnight of someone&#146;s time. When they get there, they might not have the necessary spare part, and it would take another fortnight to get it. That is one example of the island&#146;s isolation and its dependency on the RMS.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09051355000047"></a>We spoke to people who were concerned about medical treatment and told us about the amount of money needed to get to Cape Town for urgent medical treatment. They explained that in an emergency and for matters beyond the competency of the small hospital on the island, there were problems of having to travel by sea. I learnt of the restricted opportunities in education. I did not go to the school as it happened, but I made my inquiries. There is an average of 51 pupils in each year group at secondary school level. The resources of St Helena are such that only two of them can go to university. Here in the UK, it is the Government&#146;s aim to have half the pupils in secondary school going to university. Therefore, if those pupils were in the UK, there would be an expectation that about 25 of them would go.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09051355000048"></a>There are just over 4,000 people in St Helena and nearly two-thirds of the working people are in the public sector. The GDP is less than &#163;5,000 per head. More than half the employees are earning &#163;95 a week or less, yet the cost of living is greater than in the United Kingdom. Therefore, as my noble friend hinted, it has a four-tier economy: the people who are content to earn their living in St Helena; those who are content to go a little further and go to Ascension and earn a little more; those who are prepared to go a bit further and earn more still in the Falklands; and those who,  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>until recently, came to the UK. Remittances from those working abroad assist the economy and are a very important part of it, but those working abroad rely on grandparents to look after their children in St Helena.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09051355000049"></a>An airport would improve access, the economy and quality of life. Clearly, this comes down to money. I have looked at the nature of aid. As I understand it, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, will respond to the debate with a brief from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, yet the resources for St Helena come from the Department for International Development. As my noble friend indicated, it is the stated policy of the Government that the reasonable assistance needs of the overseas territories are a first call on the aid programme. With the exception of St Helena, Montserrat and the Pitcairn Islands, DfID has an entirely different, albeit entirely honourable, remit of trying to achieve the millennium development goals. However, that aim is shared by others: 10 per cent of aid comes from Britain, 90 per cent comes from elsewhere. Many countries throughout the world that receive aid from us receive far greater sums of aid from elsewhere. However, that is not the case with St Helena, which receives aid only from the UK. The only bilateral aid that St Helena receives is from the UK. It has received some resources from the European Union, a tiny smidgen from a United Nations body and something like &#163;7,500 from Australia and Greece.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09051355000050"></a>I have been looking at aid from other Commonwealth countries. Hardly any of the small islands in the South Pacific that have been granted independence in the past 30 years are receiving UK aid now. In other words, once a place is independent, it is able to knock on other doors. However, that is not the position with St Helena. For example, well over half of the overseas aid of the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde comes from countries other than Portugal. The point I am making is that other independent countries have other doors on which to knock. However, dependent overseas territories have no other doors on which to knock. I question whether DfID, as opposed to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is fit for purpose in terms of dispensing aid to the dependent overseas territories.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09051355000051"></a>There is a consultation document on the most appropriate option for access. When you first read the document you think that its proposals are fair enough, but when you read it again you think, just a minute, this jars somewhat. The document refers to a code of practice on consultation and when to consult. It states that formal consultation should take place where there is scope to influence the policy outcome. The document tells us that the preferred policy option is option C&#151;delay. It then refers to who will be consulted. Consultation will take place with St Helenians, residents, expatriates and other stakeholders and others with an interest in the overall use of the Government&#146;s development budget. These groups will include representatives of potential investors and non-governmental organisations. I am rather in favour of non-governmental organisations, particularly those that are involved in overseas aid, and so forth. If one bears in mind that DfID is in partnership with these very organisations and mentions them in particular as being appropriate to respond to  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1091"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1091</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this, then, almost on a wink and a nod, if an airport is built, perhaps there will not be quite as many resources for the NGOs to be concerned about.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09051355000052"></a>The document also tells us a lot more about DfID than it does about the concerns of St Helena. It tells us about its global concerns over resources. In one sense, the document is slightly neo-colonialist because it almost assumes that the only money that one can spend is sterling. If it is a bad time for sterling, it is a good time for the euro and the dollar. It may well be that our aid money is not buying as much as it did, but the corollary to that must be that other people&#146;s aid money is doing rather better.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09051355000053"></a>Option C is delay but, in truth, option A means delay anyway. If the Minister were to say in 20 minutes&#146; time, &#147;I am going to surprise you. We are going ahead with this airport now&#148;, it will be 2013 before the first plane lands. That is a delay. Option C means even greater delay. Access and economy go hand in hand. DfID is already exposed to some &#163;8 million on this project. St Helenians themselves are already exposed to &#163;6 million and promises are being made. The airport is a significant issue for the Government to tackle. It is not some incidental matter in the projected DfID budget.</p>

My honourable friend the shadow International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell MP, has taken a personal interest in the future of St Helena. Indeed, his deputy, Mark Lancaster MP, has this morning returned from St Helena, which he visited specifically to ascertain what the prospects are and how to go forward. That is part of thinking through the overall strategy for the dependent territories, which we feel has, frankly, been lacking from the Government.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09051359000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, was eloquent about his romantic and prolonged journey, but he also raised some important questions about the administration strategy and handling of the situation, not only in St Helena but in other dependent territories. However, the subject is St Helena, which has a special place in our national historical memory. We all remember the vivid cameo of Bonaparte caged on the HMS &#147;Bellerophon&#148;, anchored, I think, off Falmouth, with people rowing out to look at the tyrant. He was waiting for an answer to a polite letter that he had written to the Prince Regent, asking whether, now that it was all over, he could have a modest-sized mansion in somewhere such as Claremont in Surrey, with a dozen servants, where he could live quite modestly as a country gentleman. He waited and waited and, of course, instead of a reply from the Prince Regent, to his dismay he got a note from the captain saying, &#147;We are not going to leafy Surrey; we are going to St Helena and Longwood&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09051359000003"></a>That is the history, but now we must move into the future. My colleagues have been looking seriously at St Helena, examining the central question of whether an airstrip or airport could be built within an inevitably tight budget and whether something could be taken  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1092"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1092</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forward on a sensible scale, with the help of private enterprise. I do not know the precise answer, but I can tell the House that one suggestion put to me by a leading aviation consultant, Mr Michael Woodley, is that, in the absence of a decision about the big project&#151;the &#163;200 million airport&#151;some thinking about an interim air-access development could be organised at a fraction of the cost. Options for enlargement would come later. That would begin to open up a situation in which, as we have been told, the only lifeline to the island is the RMS &#147;St Helena&#148;, which I want to come back to in a moment. Otherwise the islanders, particularly those who are seriously ill or with medical conditions, would be literally cut off and condemned, because they could not get out at short notice.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09051359000004"></a>How could such an objective be achieved if there were an airstrip, rather than a full-blown airport that could carry larger jets? It has been suggested that the civilianised versions of the Grumman Albatross amphibian planes, which are especially equipped to land in rough water, could land in the St Helena harbour at first and, later, on a shorter airstrip, which would be half the length of the eventual full airstrip. Those aircraft would connect on a feeder basis from Ascension Island with the twice-weekly&#151;I think&#151;RAF flights from Brize Norton that pass through Ascension on their way to the Falklands.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09051359000005"></a>I should very much like the Minister to comment on this, because it is an extremely important possibility. There was, and I hope still is, an agreement between the US and the UK to allow a few commercial weekly flights to land on Ascension, which, of course, is mainly controlled by the US military, in the light of its elaborate installations there. Is that agreement still there, because that could open the way for some unscheduled commercial flights and open up the possibility of air links that are otherwise denied to the islanders?</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09051359000006"></a>All of this is against the background that RMS &#147;St Helena&#148;, which is the only lifeline, needs refurbishment. There is talk of it needing a &#163;12 million refurbishment and that, for that to be done, it would have to be out of action in 2010. The island would be even more cut off than it is now. It would have no link at all with the outside world.</p>

<a name="90513-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09051359000007"></a>I do not know whether any of this is possible. It would require expert aviation consultants and highly skilled engineers, including the Royal Engineers, to lay down quick and effective airstrips, as a start. However, it is an interim possibility that would open the way for the eventual development of a full link, when it can be afforded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09051359000008"></a>The time has come for a bit of creative thinking about the people of St Helena, who are, as we have heard, disillusioned and disappointed at the cancellation, postponement, pause or whatever it is in the major project. That creative thinking opens up the possibility of initial air links, if only to bring a few tourists or to bring a lifeline if someone becomes seriously ill, even if it reduces the connection with the outside world from whatever it is&#151;five or six days&#151;to a few hours. It could be done, but that degree of creative thinking does not seem to be evident in the consultation document or in the departmental thinking that we have heard so far about the future. I should very much like to hear

The importance of the issue is reflected by the strength with which the case was put on all sides of the House.

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09051355000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, was right to say that we are in considerable difficulty with regard to the St Helena airport project, for reasons that we all understand. Of course I am guarded this evening, because we are involved in a consultation exercise and there is no way that I will pre-empt the outcome of that process. The consultation exercise is part of the pause in the project that we have initiated. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said about the pause being dispiriting for those who had hoped that the project would go ahead according to our plans of 2004-05, but the world lives in changed circumstances and it is understandable that a project of this significance should reflect that change.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09051355000056"></a>Of course we have difficulties, with regard to our development and aid budget, in meeting our requirements. Resources have gone down while the demands of those who need aid have increased with the impoverishment that the changes in the world economy have brought about. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, mentioned Montserrat. The value of our aid to Montserrat has dropped by 30 per cent because its currency is pegged to the dollar. We will address this cut in support as constructively as we can, but it is a measure of how difficult the economic crisis is making matters for DfID and for our aid projects. A project on the significant scale of the airport in St Helena was bound to occasion great difficulty, which is why we are engaged in the consultation exercise.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09051355000057"></a>I have been asked how long the pause will be. The consultation exercise ends at the end of July, so the Government expect to produce an analysis of the situation, and a response, by the end of the year. We will then take the matter from there. In his opening speech, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, left us in no doubt about the significance of the airport to a society that is clearly suffering. The figures relating to the loss of population from St Helena are clear. We know, from the difficulties aptly described by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and by everyone who has had the good fortune to make it to St Helena, how difficult the journey is.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09051355000058"></a>Reference was made to the fact that the Minister has not been to St Helena. I ask the House to recognise the obligations of the DfID Minister, given the support that we give to so many countries in the world. Our aid to Africa alone involves a significant number of countries. I was on the Select Committee on development in the

Even with a Select Committee working full-time, we did not begin to touch the surface of the problems of Africa. We made one or two visits, largely because Select Committees do not have to answer Questions back in the House, respond to debates or undertake any other ministerial obligations. In the four or five years that I was on the Select Committee, I never felt that we could&#151;</p>

<a name="09051355000059"></a><b><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051355000082"></a>Lord Hoyle:</b> My Lords, my noble friend is making a very good point about the amount of travel that a Minister has to do, but can he tell me of any other overseas territory that the Minister has not visited?</p>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="09051355000060"></a><b><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051355000083"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am saying that there are bound to be several because otherwise a Minister would spend the whole of his time in aircraft. My noble friend has spoken with great strength on the issue, but I wonder with what enthusiasm he envisages regular visits to St Helena, given the travel difficulties that noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, have identified. That is bound to be a constraint. After all, there is a constraint on the airport.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09051355000061"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, constructively said about the airport, although I notice that he made no commitment on behalf of his party about the resources involved; he had smaller-scale suggestions. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concept that smaller aircraft might produce a feeling among the community that something was being done, however marginal. I can see the value of that for a very small number of people. It might act as help for those who are stricken and cannot get elsewhere; I am not denying the value of that and I take the point on board. The noble Lord will know that the airport is about the development of that society, and the only prospect of development is tourism. The airport is therefore about how you get tourists in sufficient numbers to make an impact on the economy. The noble Lord&#146;s proposal for small sea-planes landing in the non-existent harbour in choppy waters seems to me to have limited attraction for large-scale tourist operations, although I have no doubt that he will find my noble friend Lord Hoyle to be the first on that aircraft, if it ever emerges.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09051355000062"></a>There are difficulties. This is a large-scale project for a very small economy. That is not to decry the needs of the people of St Helena. We have obligations to them&#151;obligations that the Government are fulfilling. It was recognised in the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Jones, that the island can sustain its present population, distressing though aspects of that level is, only through British commitment and British aid. We are fulfilling our obligations under the United Nations charter to St Helena and other overseas territories in the resources that we make available. Inevitably, those resources are more limited at present than they otherwise would be.</p>

I was at a private briefing in the town a few weeks ago where it was made clear to me&#151;an official of Her Majesty&#146;s Government was present&#151;that private interests were prepared to contribute  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>substantially to both the capital and the running costs of the airport. I have heard no mention of that today. Can my noble friend assist the House by telling us precisely what private interests may be involved? Have there been discussions with Her Majesty&#146;s Government?</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="09051355000064"></a><b><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051355000085"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, there certainly are discussions; of course the Government are keen to examine every conceivable option. My noble friend, with his vast experience of defence contracts, will know that the capital work involved is the bulk of the cost and has to be met up front. The estimated costs in the consultation document are between &#163;230 million and &#163;250 million. We are not talking chicken feed here; we are talking about significant resources. Therefore, in the period of credit crunch and shortage of resources in the private sector as much as in government circles, he will appreciate how much more difficult it is to obtain private support.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09051355000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked about a particular group of private contributors, namely Shelco. Officials have had a meeting with Shelco, which has had ideas about financing the project. We understand that proposals may be submitted for a private sector approach and of course we are open to and indeed enthusiastic about such possibilities and look forward to seeing the nature of those proposals. However, we are at a rudimentary stage with those developments at present and I did not dare not wax enthusiastic about the potential outcome; I merely record the fact, bearing in mind what my noble friend Lord Gilbert has said&#151;and it has reinforced what everyone who has spoken in this debate has said&#151;that, if we can get resources from elsewhere to buttress government funds for this project, we are eager to explore every option. However, I am counselling against undue expectations about that position.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09051355000066"></a>I was asked about European funding. St Helena gets its proper share of European funding and that money is already voted for this year, so it is not being short-changed on the European front. Of course, it would not be in the interests of the Government to fail to obtain a guarantee on the availability of those resources to St Helena. The money is available over a considerable period&#151;the next five years. However, it is a very limited sum and so we cannot look to the European Community resource for too much; it is a little more than tokenism but far short of what is needed to make a real impact on the lives of the people there. That is why the British aid programme is so  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1096"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column 1096</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>critical. Although I will fulfil the expectation of my noble friend Lord Hoyle in not really saying anything too positive about the airport project, I am positive about the Government&#146;s commitment in its aid programme to ensure that we sustain the position as far as St Helena is concerned. Against a background where we all appreciate the pressures on government expenditure, the Government deserve some credit for that.</p>

<a name="90513-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09051355000067"></a>As for timescale, I have indicated that we are not going to pronounce on the outcome of the consultation; I merely say that we will receive the results in the very near future, although that will be against a background of substantial constraints on government expenditure. All noble Lords will recognise that the only responsible way of addressing these significant issues is not to suggest that it is easy for us to create the circumstances that obtained in 2004-05, when we were setting about the task of addressing the airport issue at costs that were much lower than they are now. The figure of &#163;230 million to &#163;250 million is a significant escalation on the costs that we were contemplating in 2005. More important than that, the economic circumstances of the world and the British Government have changed significantly over the last 18 months. That is bound to condition our response to this important and worthwhile project, although I congratulate the noble Lord on bringing this debate today and airing the issue.</p>

We will have to spend a lot of money very soon to get things going, but I hear what the noble Lord says. Noble Lords could speak to this House on every aspect of the aid budget and rightly identify very real need and very real reasons why the Government should direct themselves to such a priority. These priorities are myriad; that is in the nature of development and aid. I shall state the obvious: the Government might be subject to certain criticism at the present time, but the expansion of the aid budget since 1997 has been second to none.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000005"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051346000074"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I start by expressing my thanks to the Minister for moving his amendment at some length; we are grateful for the comprehensive nature of the explanation that he gave of the amendments. We were also grateful for the explanation that we had from him and his officials the day before of the purpose of the amendments.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000006"></a>Having said that, I will repeat the point that we made on Second Reading and which has also been made by the spokesmen for the Liberal Democrat party; that it would have been helpful if we could have seen the amendments, or at least a draft of them, at a much earlier stage. I understand that the Government had agreed two amendments of this sort on Report in another place, and I think that is now probably two or three months ago. If we could have seen the amendments, or drafts of them, on Second Reading or before, that would have helped. As it is, we will have to spend quite a long time on them on Report, particularly dealing with the concerns that we, and I suspect the Liberal Democrats, have about them. Those concerns largely reflect the question of timing.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000007"></a>The noble Lord has put into his amendments something that is very unusual; a suggestion that the earliest possible date that this can come into effect is 2014, even if the Government, the Electoral Commission and all others in the run-up to that date think that everything is in place and ready to go. If the amendments go through as they are now, we cannot go any earlier than 2014 without amending primary legislation. I give notice that I have a strong suspicion that we will be tabling amendments, which I suspect will be supported by the Liberal Democrats, or the Liberal Democrats will table some similar amendment that will suggest not having a cast-iron date in the Bill but leaving it to such a moment when it is felt by the Electoral Commission and others who have an interest that we are ready to move forward with individual voter registration.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000008"></a>I make it clear to the Minister that we are not happy with the timing, and we will certainly seek an amendment on that. It seems very odd to have in statute a hard and fast rule with a time limit of this sort that binds the

It looks slightly as if the current Government, for their own particular electoral reasons, find it more convenient to make sure that nothing can happen until 2014 at the earliest.</p>

I shall leave it to the noble Lord to interpret what I said. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that the Government have a desire to ensure that no individual voter registration can happen&#151;obviously, it cannot happen before the next election, which has to happen before May or June next year at the absolute latest. That would imply that the next election after that would be some time in 2015 and would be excluded from this. It might be that the Government for their own reasons&#151;which may be party-political reasons, although I would not like to suggest that&#151;would prefer to put it off until that date.</p>

He has made an accusation that we wish to defer the measure for electoral considerations. He should spell out exactly what he means, because it brings me to the heart of my case. He should not duck the question that I am asking.</p>

The Government, being very honourable, have said very clearly that the reason why they are doing this is that they want to make it possible to get these provisions ready on time. We are saying that it would be perfectly easy to get them ready beforehand, if the Electoral Commission and others said so; if that was the case, we would move forward at that stage. I do not know what goes on in the Government&#146;s mind and I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, as a Back-Bencher, does not know what goes on in the Government&#146;s collective mind.</p>

If he is not suggesting that, what is he suggesting?</p>

<p><a name="09051346000014"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051346000080"></a>Lord Henley:</b> Of course I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting simply that within the minds of certain people within the Labour Party and the Government they might have thoughts of that sort. That is entirely a matter for them; I cannot comment on that. All that I am suggesting is that for some reason the Government want to make it absolutely impossible to bring this into effect before 2015, in effect. We believe that it might be possible for these provisions to be ready before that date. Whether that is the case I do not know.</p>

One could always stand what the noble Lord says on its head and say that the reason why he wants to bring this forward is because he believes that it will be of political advantage to the Conservative Party. One should be just a bit careful about these sorts of comments.</p>

All that I have said is that it is very peculiar for the Government to insist on such a hard and fast rule that they write down a date. A word like &#147;2014&#148; does not often appear in statute; it makes it impossible to bring the provision in any earlier. If it is ready to come into effect before that and that is the advice, one should do that. There is nothing wrong with that, if it reduces the amount of electoral fraud. I could go into detail about the amount of electoral fraud that we have seen over the past few years. I could quote from that judge in the Birmingham case, and possibly we will get to that later when we discuss amendments on postal voting; he talked about the fact that what was going on would disgrace a banana republic. I am not going to do that. All that I am saying is that it is very peculiar to find a word such as &#147;2014&#148; in this legislation, when one could say, &#147;at a time when the Electoral Commission thinks it appropriate&#148;.</p>

They have been tabled to invite the Minister to make a response; in other words, they are probing amendments.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000020"></a>Amendment 125BA deals with our concerns about data protection implications. The introduction of individual voter registration will mean that a lot more personal information is held by the electoral registration officers and shared between both central and local  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC390"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governments. Therefore, before such schemes for individual voter registration are established by order, consultation should take place with the Information Commissioner, as well as the Electoral Commission, to ensure that adequate data security procedures are in place and that best practice is followed. We certainly do not want any further examples of large-scale data loss on our hands from local government at a time when we are trying to improve confidence in the electoral register.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000021"></a>Amendment 132AA deals with the fact that there is currently no provision for personal identification at the ballot box. That bit of electoral fraud arising from impersonation has not been dealt with. I appreciate that that is not a major problem. As will be obvious to the Committee from the exchanges between myself and my fellow Cumbrian, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, most of the problems with electoral fraud are in relation to postal voting. There have obviously been problems with impersonation in the long distant past but, in the main, postal voting fraud is the principal problem. However, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response on the question of personal identification at the ballot box.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000022"></a>I hope that that is helpful. I look forward to further debates on this matter on Report. No doubt we will hear more from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, both then and later on this amendment. For the moment, however, I leave it at that.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000023"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09051346000085"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> I welcome, of course, the thrust of the government amendment to introduce personal identifiers, on the basis that some of us have been arguing for them for a long time. Indeed, they should have been introduced around 2000, when we changed many things, including allowing postal voting to be on demand rather than on the basis of a stated case. Our concerns are now that, although it is coming in better late than never, we would like it to come in sooner if at all possible. On behalf of my noble friend Lord Tyler and myself, I therefore speak to Amendments 125CA and 125CB.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000024"></a>We are concerned that this issue needs to be addressed. It has taken so long to get here since 2000 that it is clear that we should have started earlier. From where we are now, however, it may be possible to make quicker progress. I hope that when the Minister responds to Amendments 125CA and 125CB, he will not simply say that it is not possible. All that these amendments say is that, if it is possible, we would like to consider making more rapid progress. That seems as reasonable and as moderate an amendment as you could possibly table on this issue.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000025"></a>The issue requires some urgency. There have been discussions about the level of electoral fraud in this country. The truth is that nobody really knows what it is. It is not proper to try to assess the level of fraud simply by looking at convictions, because, as we know, most forms of crime in this country do not result in convictions. It is not a reliable approach.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000026"></a>If more people knew how easy it was to commit electoral fraud in our system, there would probably be rather more of it. I have certainly come across some

It is probably not very widespread, but any system that makes it possible easily to cheat and abuse the system must be reformed.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000027"></a>I shall not go on at length about my own experiences, but I recall the electoral abuses of the Militant Tendency in Liverpool, which I fought from the side of the Liberal Party and which I know the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, fought from that of the Labour Party. With all my experience of elections, I could not understand how it was turning out as many votes as it appeared to be doing given the level of their canvass returns&#151;and I like to think that I am quite good at assessing these things. Eventually, I came to the obvious conclusion, confirmed subsequently by those on the Labour Party side who were investigating the tactics of the Militant Tendency, that it could turn out so many votes with such little support was because a lot of people were going around the polling stations casting votes on behalf of people who they knew were not voting. It was very easily done. I am not suggesting that it is widespread, but it is so easy to do that we should move as quickly as we reasonably can to try to address it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000028"></a>With hindsight, those of us who agreed to the extension of postal voting in 2000 probably should not have done so unless we had at the very least a clear and workable timetable for the introduction of the personal identifiers. We now see the whole political system discredited when elections come around, fraud in relation to postal votes and, just occasionally, impersonation at the polling stations.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000029"></a>My amendments suggest that if, in 2014 or any year prior to it, the Electoral Commission deems it appropriate, it should be able to make an assessment as to whether we can make more progress. We know that the issues are accuracy and completeness&#151;that is not in dispute. We are saying simply that the Electoral Commission should be able to assess progress on accuracy and completeness and that the Government should pay due regard to its suggestions.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000030"></a>To go through two more Westminster general elections without a system of personal identifiers would be quite wrong. We may take a long time over it. Returning officers are hard pressed; they say that it is very difficult to collect those data; we may feel there are problems with both accuracy and completeness. But if we are reasonably satisfied on the principal tests of accuracy and completeness in the register&#151;and the independent arbiter of it must be the Electoral Commission&#151;we should make progress on reforming the system and ending the potential for abuse as rapidly as we can.</p>

I am totally opposed to the proposals being brought forward by the Government. I am opposed to the principle of national rollout of individual registration at any stage. I previously commented on these issues in Grand Committee on the Electoral Administration Bill on 21 March 2006 at col. 84 of the <I>Official Report</I>, but I shall today further embroider the arguments that I used then.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000032"></a>I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe is unable to join us today. I am indebted to him for having tried to facilitate a dialogue between me and the department&#146;s officials so that we could perhaps establish some common ground and agree on the statistical information which I want to produce and they may wish to contest. But this is only Committee, and I therefore have an opportunity prior to Report to meet his officials. I am indebted to him; he is one of life&#146;s natural conciliators, as we have all learnt over recent months.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000033"></a>I am totally opposed to national rollout. It is a waste of public money. At a time when local authorities are being required to make economies&#151;as indeed are government departments&#151;and when everyone is being required to tighten their belts, we are throwing money at a problem that is marginal and only exists in certain parts of the country. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, has admitted that it does not exist in our county.</p>

I do not know for a fact whether there is any electoral fraud in Cumbria or anywhere else. All we know about are the cases where people have been caught, and there have been quite a number, as the noble Lord will be aware. I admit, and the noble Lord will also accept, that this is something that has affected all three parties.</p>

Indeed, I argue that it will lead to a reduction. If anyone wants to revisit the arguments, they need only refer to the 2005 report of the Electoral Commission, which sets out the groups that would be penalised under a system of national rollout. This information is taken from that report. The five groups are: deprived groups in areas of deprivation, people living in metropolitan areas, unemployed groups, certain housing tenancy groups, and people who live in houses of multiple occupation. I do not want to read out all of the sections in that report that are relevant to electoral registration proposals in the Bill, but for the record, in case there are people who read our proceedings, they should read paragraphs 234, 237, 242, 244, 245, 248, 251 and 254 because the information in that Electoral Commission report points the way forward as to the problems that will inevitably arise if national rollout takes place.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000039"></a>There are another two reports. There is the first report from the Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for Session 2004-05 and the special report  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC393"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC393</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of that committee on the Government&#146;s response to the Northern Ireland Committee&#146;s first report. I shall refer to both those reports. We have to consider what has happened in Northern Ireland, and I want to produce figures that may be of interest to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000040"></a>If you take their figures identifying the 20 worst local authorities for electoral registration in the United Kingdom in 2004, the worst authority in the country out of 442 was Kensington and Chelsea, which disputes the figures. The second worst, at 441, was Westminster, which also disputes the figures and sent me a letter disputing why the council is at the bottom of the list in terms of electoral registration. The letter states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051346000066"></a>&#147;I attach as background the analysis of the City of Westminster electorate as last published on 1 December 2008. This gives you more information than you requested, but I hope you will find it useful as background. The December 2008 register was based on forms returned from just under 87 per cent of Westminster households. Further forms returned since then have raised this, so we currently cover register based on a return from over 92 per cent of Westminster households.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000064"></a>The letter continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051346000067"></a>&#147;Any comparison of Westminster&#146;s registered electorate against its estimated adult population fails to take account of the high proportion of foreign nationals resident in Westminster who are ineligible to register (e.g. citizens of the US, Russia, China and many other countries)&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000041"></a>At 440th on the list is Forest Heath, which, I understand, is an area in which many American and foreign servicemen live, distorting the figure. Then you hit a group of areas in the United Kingdom where there are no excuses to justify their low levels of registration.</p>

They were virtually of no value to us at all in Gloucestershire, where we had enormous majorities anyway.</p>

In other words, at the bottom of the electoral registration tables within the United Kingdom at the time that the Northern Ireland committee in the other place was doing its work, all these Northern Irish local authorities came bottom of the list in electoral registration.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000047"></a>The percentages have been calculated, according to our source, using the mid-2007 population estimates for local authorities in the United Kingdom of those aged 18 and above and the numbers of people registered to vote in local government elections on 1 December 2007. I correct myself, I said 2004 before; I meant 2007.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000048"></a>Those statistics show that there is a problem in areas where this system of electoral registration has been introduced. My amendments concentrate on where the problem exists. In my view, there is no problem in Cumbria. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, did not want to be absolutely clear on that matter because he knew that if he were to concede that, he would be conceding much of my argument.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000049"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="09051346000096"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I speak purely as a lawyer: I cannot say categorically that there is no problem if I do not know whether there is a problem. I am not going to say that one county is clean and another county is not. We know where there are problems, but that does not mean there are not necessarily problems in other places that we think are okay.</p>

I suspect that there are no problems in probably 99 per cent of the UK land mass area. The problem exists in communities which carry a substantial ethnic minority population, and that is the reality. It is not racist to say that, because we live in the real world. In the debate in the other place some weeks ago, there were interventions from Members who were prepared to say that that was the case.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000051"></a>My case is very simple: why do we punish the whole nation for a problem that exists in a very small number of areas within the United Kingdom? Why are we prepared to create difficulties and administrative problems? Why are we prepared to waste public money on a national rollout of a system which affects the whole country when the problem is localised in very few areas within the United Kingdom? Government policy should target such areas with the amount of resource necessary to ensure that the problems are dealt with and should not waste money in areas like Cumbria, where we are already short of money in terms of local authority block grant. Why spend millions on administration?</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000053"></a>What does my Amendment 126 do? It places a responsibility on local authorities where there is a problem to apply to the Secretary of State for the power under an order to introduce a scheme which would then operate within the local authority area. It would target the problem where it exists.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000054"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051346000098"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I am a little confused. Perhaps the noble Lord could explain the problem for me. We are talking about individual registration, about fraud and about postal votes. What is his identification of the problem?</p>

<p><a name="09051346000055"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051346000099"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> The problem essentially, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said, is fraud in the postal vote system. We are introducing a system of national rollout to deal with a problem of fraud which exists in very few parts of the country. The most recent case, if I remember rightly, was in Slough and was postal vote fraud. The cases which have been drawn to national attention in recent years have essentially been postal vote cases when people have sought to impersonate others by signing postal vote applications or have taken a number of postal vote ballot papers and signed them on behalf of others without those people knowing what was happening.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000056"></a>What would be the effect of the amendment? The local authority would avoid, at all costs, introducing a scheme and inconveniencing millions of people. It would try to sort out the problem locally without the use of the scheme. In the event that it could not sort out the matter locally without the use of the scheme, the local authority would apply to the scheme and it would probably concentrate its use on those wards with a problem, but not necessarily. It might want to apply the scheme throughout the whole of the local authority area. The Government would be able to concentrate additional money on areas with real problems. It would foster intra-ethnic community debate on the need to avoid corruption of the system. In ethnic minority communities, a debate is going on where one group says that another group is not using the electoral system fairly. Arguments are already going on in those areas and individual groups which failed to agree could go to the local authority and ask for action. If the authority felt that there was a serious enough problem, it could apply for an order. It would stop piling up expensive legal responsibilities on local authorities.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000057"></a>So what are the arguments against my amendment? It would concentrate effort on ethnic minority communities. What is wrong with that? We already single out ethnic minority community areas for community support projects, employment support programmes, policing resources and literacy programmes, so anyone who somehow, as happened on a previous occasion when this amendment came forward, argues that there is some sort of racist overtone to this has completely

I have described it here and may do again this afternoon. But does he not understand that there is a danger if it is the local authority he is talking about rather than the local returning officer and their staff? A difficulty in some of these areas is that returning officers and election staff may not be sufficiently independent from the political control of the local authority. It is really the returning officers who need to sort these things out. Local authorities, because they are involved in the politics of it, may find it more difficult to do so.</p>

However, if an electoral registration officer within the local authority is dissatisfied with the response of the local authority, and he or she maintains that there is a problem with corruption of the electoral system, they can go to the Electoral Commission or to a Member of Parliament. It is unlikely that the majority of members of the local authority would be so corrupt that they would be prepared to turn a blind to corruption of the electoral system in a particular area. A minority of councillors within that authority area would want to foster such corrupt activities; I would have thought that the majority would be very much opposed to them.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051346000061"></a>I turn to the issue of data transfer under the proposals. I understand that there are already within local authorities arrangements for the interdepartmental transfer of data&#151;for housing benefit, council tax information and so forth. I am told that some local authorities are tardy over the use of such facilities. However, I am also told that it is the Government&#146;s intention to pilot the use of data transfer from national databases such as the DVLA and DWP to local authorities for use in electoral registration. That is in the Bill. Perhaps before doing so, they should read the recent Joseph Rowntree report, rather provocatively called <I>The </I><I>Database </I><I>S</I><I>tate</I>, to which my noble friend has referred on a previous occasion at the Dispatch Box.

<p><a name="09051346000065"></a>Reading between the lines, it is obvious that the need for cross-referencing is based on some risk assessment. It is quite conceivable that the data-matching service, which has been in operation for over 10 years and which includes DWP benefits, Royal Mail redirecting, TV licences and other services, which detects fraud and error in benefits and is applied to millions of claimants, must provide for flagging-up areas of risk. I contend that many of those areas will include among them areas of social deprivation among which there will be precisely the same areas that I seek to identify in my amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09051346000063"></a>I therefore argue that a risk assessment, which at the end inevitably targets certain areas with high ethnic minority populations, is more likely to breach discrimination considerations than an arrangement that allows those same areas themselves to voluntarily apply to central government for permission to adopt a scheme that deals with that same element of risk.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000001"></a>I should like to read into the record some information which has come from the other place. I refer to the report produced by the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee, which dealt with the whole matter of individual registration. In paragraph 18, the committee says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000066"></a>&#147;A pattern appears to be emerging for the number of registered electors to decline at each canvass only to show a slow increase thereafter as a consequence of rolling registrations. The Electoral Commission pointed to evidence suggesting &#145;an emerging downward trend in the electoral register&#146;. Although this evidence was limited because the new system had been in operation for 18 months at the time, the Commission considered that &#145;nonetheless the available &#145;like-for-like&#146; comparisons indicate that the register is falling by about 1.5-2 per cent per annum&#146;. This view is backed up by the 2004 canvass results, published on 1 December 2004, which show a further decline in the register to a registration level of just 83.9%.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000067"></a>This finding is a particular cause for concern in Northern Ireland because the adult population of Northern Ireland is increasing at a rate of 0.7% per annum. The Electoral Commission warned that: &#145;...unless it is rectified, the downward trend in the register has the potential of embedding itself structurally in the registration process. If the register is in decline, then the number that can be canvassed will also tend to fall from one canvass to the next, thus reinforcing the cycle&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000002"></a>The committee goes on to say at paragraph 49:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000068"></a>&#147;The shift from household to individual registration is one of the key changes resulting from the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. This change was essential to eliminate some of the possible sources of &#145;phantom&#146; names on the register. However, this is now one of the key factors contributing to the low levels of registration in certain population groups&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000061"></a>I repeat: one factor was the phantom vote. Paragraph 78 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000069"></a>&#147;The second appears to be that a significant proportion of the eligible population does not register. There are several causes for this but there is little doubt that one of the most significant is the change to individual registration. The shift away from a system, where one person in each household registers the entire household to one in which each individual has the responsibility for their own registration requires individuals to be more pro-active if their names are to be included on the register&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000062"></a>Paragraph 80 reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000070"></a>&#147;We are deeply concerned by signs that the system of individual registration is causing a spiral of structural decline in the electoral register. This appears to occur because every year only those people who were registered the previous year are directly canvassed. While people are able to register outside the canvass periods through rolling registration, the number registering each year through this mechanism is lower than the number of people dropping out of the register in canvass registrations from one year to the next. Consequently, the register has been shrinking progressively. We believe that the level of electoral registration in Northern Ireland has now reached the point at which it will begin to have an adverse effect on public confidence in the integrity of the process&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000003"></a>We will have a report like this in a matter of a few years. The question is: what would happen in those circumstances? The noble Lord, Lord Henley, appeared to be pretty frank about that. I think he was actually  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC398"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>saying that he saw electoral advantage in individual registration, and I think he was suggesting that we might see electoral disadvantage. In other conditions, another Government might have that in mind. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, shakes his head, but I do not think that he can shake his head on behalf of his party when it comes to electoral considerations of that nature. I think that another Government might have other matters in mind in the event that they are required to make the changes which the Electoral Commission, under the legislation with which we are dealing, suggests to them concerning the further reforms that it feels are necessary prior to compulsory registration in 2014-15.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000004"></a>Further on, under &#147;Political Discrimination&#148;, the report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000071"></a>&#147;Research by the Electoral Commission has shown that the highest decline in electoral registration occurred in the top 20 most deprived wards of which 69% are catholic and 27% protestant. This represents a serious adverse impact on the catholic/nationalist community in particular and exposes the highly political motivation behind the electoral legislation. Those who supported this legislation must look to the effect it is having, not just in terms of denying large numbers of people their right to vote, but in the categories of people being affected: the poorest within the nationalist community and to a lesser degree the poorest within the protestant community. It has affected the young, the old, those with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The pattern emerging across the north is that this legislation is producing a two-tier system whereby affluent areas are returning high registration uptake and the poorest areas, mostly in deprived catholic and protestant wards, are alarmingly low&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000005"></a>Can we see the writing on the wall? Can we see, as we proceed with this project, that there are huge dangers inherent in this whole approach? We may well effectively be disfranchising very large numbers of people in the inner cities who cannot be canvassed, who will perhaps simply be ignored in the future for political reasons. I am particularly concerned about that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000006"></a>I refer to a speech by Fiona Mactaggart on 20 October on this Bill. She is the Member for Slough, which has a large ethnic population. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000072"></a>&#147;In places where there is evidence of such corruption, there might be a case for individual voter registration. I would not support its introduction universally at the moment, because when it was introduced in Northern Ireland the number of people registered to vote went down by 10 per cent. That is not a tolerable consequence&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/08; col. 79.]</p>

<p><a name="09051357000063"></a>She is a former Home Office Minister in the Labour Government. She went on to deal with problems in her constituency in this area in some detail. We have a Member of Parliament who is a former Minister expressing concerns over electoral registration national rollout. She said that it should be dealt with on an individual basis. I understand that she is prepared to take my amendments, perhaps remodel them in some way and, if it is possible procedurally in the other place, to move them. She would have to do so under the somewhat truncated procedure whereby, on this huge issue, there is no Second Reading in the Commons, there is no Committee stage in the Commons, there is no Report stage in the Commons, there is no Third Reading in the Commons; but our Bill simply goes back for them to consider, if I am not mistaken, in one

I think that is grossly unreasonable. Unless someone can correct me, that is the case. That is completely wrong.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000007"></a>Finally, I will turn to what happened some weeks ago on binge drinkers. I raise binge drinking because when Sir Liam Donaldson made his proposals for a tax on the basis of so much per millilitre of alcohol, he argued that we should change the tax system on alcohol nationally, across the board, to deal with binge drinkers. The Prime Minister very quickly leapt in to say, &#147;Oh no, we are not going to do that&#148;. He said, &#147;Let us deal with the problem in the area where it exists. Let&#146;s deal with the problems of that particular group of people who are binge drinking. Let&#146;s not punish the whole nation with a greater level of taxation, because that is unreasonable&#148;. I have lost the quote, but I am sure that noble Lords will remember what he said at the time. If we are prepared to isolate binge drinkers and deal with them as a group, why cannot we do that in this case? Why cannot we isolate the problem in the areas where there is a problem and deal with that in isolation and not, if I might say so once again, punish the whole nation?</p>

<p><a name="09051357000008"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051357000077"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has failed to convince me on this subject. It seems to me that he has stacked up his whole argument on some rather tentative agreement between himself and my noble friend Lord Henley that there was no election fraud in Cumbria. With all due respect, neither of them knows whether there is electoral fraud in Cumbria. All we know about the convictions for electoral fraud is that they are probably the tip of a very big iceberg. Therefore, I do not think that anyone can say, &#147;There is electoral fraud in this area but not in that area&#148;, because no one is in a position to know.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000009"></a>I congratulate the Government on this legislation. Addressing the issues of identifying people in terms of their registration as voters is long overdue. If there is a Labour advantage in the status quo, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, then he is saying that many of his colleagues in another place were voted in on fraudulent votes, and I do not think he would be comfortable with that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000010"></a>Let us consider the date. I very much support the Liberal Democrat Amendment 125CA. It is quite incomprehensible to me why we have to put a fixed date of 2014 on the enactment of this legislation. We do not know what the outcome of the next election in 2010 will be. One party or another may win by a relatively small majority and may copy the Labour Government of 1964 and go to the country two years later. That means that they may well be re-elected in 2012 and might serve the full five years, so we would be talking about 2017 before this legislation comes into force. I do not understand what the point is. I have great sympathy with the view of my noble friend Lord Henley that it looks a little suspicious that the Government are digging in on this when it may well be possible for this legislation to be brought in earlier. Why do we need a fixed date? The onus is on the Government to explain their thinking. It seems to me that it could be brought in earlier and, if so, it would be much to the benefit of everyone in this country.</p>

He knows how much I disagree with him on this. I know we have spent some time talking about fraud and I know that this is part of the issue, but it is only part. We should concentrate more on one of the other reasons why this Bill is important. Perhaps I may quote from day two of Report stage on the Political Parties and Elections Bill in the House of Commons when the Minister, Mr Wills, introduced this. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000073"></a>&#147;In Public Bill Committee, we discussed&#151;and, it is fair to say, we all agreed&#151;that democracy is undermined when significant numbers of people are not able to participate in elections because they are not registered to do so. Registration is the source from which democratic participation flows. Those who are not registered are denied that participation, so we must all be concerned that it has been estimated that more than 3 million eligible people are not able to vote in this country because they are not registered&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/3/09; col. 653.]</p>

<p><a name="09051357000064"></a>To me, that is a crucial part of why it is necessary to have individual registration. To compare that with binge drinkers is completely unacceptable.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000012"></a>Individual registration&#151;I declare an interest as chair of the HS Chapman Society&#151;has been supported by the society for some years now, as it has been supported by the Electoral Commission since 2003. It is also fair to say that it was backed by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, by the Committee on Standards in Public Life and by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. This has not just appeared out of the blue; people have given a great deal of consideration to it. I go back to the HS Chapman Society, which is made up of all the political parties, ex-apparatchiks like myself, party lawyers, the Electoral Commission and electoral registration officers. I make that point on purpose because they have supported the concept of individual registration in the HS Chapman Society and they are the officers of the electoral registration association. That is very important. The whole question of registration has been covered on television in the past few weeks. The adverts have been very effective at pointing out that if you do not register you do not have a vote; they emphasise the importance of registration.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000013"></a>When the Minister introduced the debate at our last sitting, he emphasised that this was a major change to our electoral process, and that, of course, is absolutely right. What, to me, is fundamental about this, and why I believe that it can make a difference in terms of fraud, is that it removes intermediaries from the process and provides a direct contact between the individual and the state, and no one in between can affect what people are attempting to do.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000014"></a>I am sure that individual registration will reduce the level of fraud. I do not say it will eliminate it, because I do not know that you can ever eliminate fraud. There are other ways of committing fraud, as we have heard today, such as through postal voting, as some people believe. In the judgments on the cases in Birmingham and Slough, Richard Mawrey QC, advocated the case for individual registration. There were other factors, of course, but he came out very strongly in favour of individual registration.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000015"></a>I am sure we all agree that it is terribly important that the change receives proper, careful preparation&#151;I shall come to the timing in a moment&#151;because the  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC401"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC401</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>integrity of our registers is absolutely crucial, as is the authenticity of the applications. I support the concept of the three identifiers&#151;the signature, the date of birth and the national insurance number.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000016"></a>However, I say to my noble friend the Minister that we have to make sure that the EROs have the resources to be able to do the job effectively. I strongly urge that because, after the 2006 registration, money was given to local authorities to help the EROs produce better registers. I met with the Minister who was then responsible, Harriet Harman, to discuss this, and I said that just putting the money in would not work. What actually happened to the money is that a lot of it went into local government general funds. Any money allocated for this purpose must be ring-fenced so that how it is to be spent is clearly identified. Otherwise, the EROs will not be able to do the job properly.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000017"></a>One matter that the EROs will have to consider is the state of the cross-referencing with data information. Looking at the amendment, I have some sympathy with the Information Commissioner because, as I said at Second Reading, I hoped that that data, which I fully support in principle, would be in absolute conformity with the Data Protection Act so that there could be no challenge afterwards about where the information came from. I hope something will be done to ensure that that is the case.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000018"></a>My noble friend referred to the low level of registration. The reason for this, basically, is because the job is not being done properly. Obviously there are problems in some areas&#151;I appreciate that&#151;but, in the main, it is because the electoral resources have not been there and partly because either the 2000 Act or the 2006 Act reduced what electoral registration officers had to do. At one time, it was clear that they had to not only try to get the information by post but to go door to door.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000019"></a>I understand that in some areas that might be difficult and that it means that sometimes they have to go in twos because the areas are not sympathetic, but that is something that can be countered. That level of contact must be made.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000020"></a>What will also be important is the Electoral Commission&#146;s review of what is actually happening and what work is being done by electoral registration officers so that we can identify the really bad cases of electoral registration. They relate to levels of multi-occupancy, people with literacy problems and harder-to-reach groups. There is no doubt that extra resources and effort must be put into those areas to make sure that everybody gets the right to register. We must not forget that this is a right. It is not something that they should do: it is a right to be on the electoral register.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000021"></a>I so disagree with my noble friend that you can pick out some areas and not others. He said that people have identified that it might be racist to do this. It is not racist, but it is discriminatory. Therefore, I have some serious questions about being able to split things up in that way.</p>

But fraud does not only occur in those areas, although I appreciate that there are some basic problems. Having spent a lot of my time trying to sort out the membership of the Labour Party in some of these areas I can only say that some people come from a different background where electoral systems are different. Therefore, one has to do a lot of work explaining where we are at and what is the right thing to do. Most of the cases that I dealt with were not in any sense fraud; they were due to a lack of knowledge.</p>

But if a local authority itself has a problem and applies to the Secretary of State, in what way is that discriminatory? It is not the state saying, &#147;We are making you do this&#148;. It is the local authority itself saying, &#147;We need additional powers to deal with our problem&#148;. Local authorities do that all the time. They often go to the state and say that they need additional resources to deal with a problem in their areas. It may well be that they are dealing with problems that are ethnically based, but that is not discriminatory.</p>

It may have a higher level of multi-occupancy or whatever, and therefore it needs extra resources to help that process. But to pick out areas just because they happen to have a large Asian population, which is what my noble friend is saying, is discriminatory. I do not think that that is right.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000026"></a>I also need to respond on another matter. I intended to make this very short, but my noble friend has goaded me. In respect of Northern Ireland, he quoted a lot from the Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report for 2004-05, but that is now so out of date as to be unquotable as evidence in real terms. Of course we have to learn from the Northern Ireland experience. Of course it was not right to begin with: there is no question about that. There were things that were not done as well as they should have been, and there were systems that were not done as they should have been done.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000027"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051357000083"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> My noble friend says that the report is out of date. Perhaps I can give her the latest figures, which were published two months ago by Mr Wills, the Minister. Pre-2002, electoral registration in Northern Ireland was 1,192,000. The last figure was 1,142,000&#151;down 50,000 over seven years of this so-called scheme. Meanwhile, the population over 18 in Northern Ireland in 2001 was 1,233,000 and in 2009 it was 1,327,000. Registration has dropped in those seven years and the population has gone up 100,000. Something is wrong somewhere.</p>

That caused many problems and contributed considerably to the low level of registration at that time. We do not intend to do that and it does not appear in the Bill. That was one of the fundamental differences between the two systems. The latest figures from the Electoral Commission show that, while registration is not back up to the same level, it is increasing every year as the carry-forward facility and the system of continuous registration have been adopted.</p>

I believe that that is how the system started in Northern Ireland and it produced considerable indignation. People said, &#147;Why do we have to come? Why are we not trusted?&#148; The system was altered so that it became possible to register for I am not sure how long, but annual registration ceased.

That is why we have not introduced a system of annual registration in the amendments before us. By changing the system, Northern Ireland got rid of the negative impact of annual registration.

<p><a name="09051357000031"></a>One terribly important point about what happened in Northern Ireland is that the register published on 1 December 2007&#151;I accept that that was 18 months ago&#151;was 94 per cent accurate. For those of us who had some contact with Northern Ireland and its electoral system some time ago, the idea that a register could be 94 per cent accurate was unbelievable, because everyone knew that there were phantom voters and serious problems there. I found it fascinating to go to Northern Ireland and talk to the electoral registration officers about their problems. I have spoken to the current ERO in Northern Ireland, and he is very happy about the system and the way that it now works.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000032"></a>I wish to make a couple of final points, the first being the length of time for the introduction of the system. I have a little sympathy for querying whether there is a need to put the date in the Bill. I understand all the reasons for the Government and the Electoral Commission needing time to do the necessary work to ensure that the register is accurate, but I wonder whether it is necessary to put the date in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000033"></a>One of the fundamental differences between the systems&#151;this was mentioned by my noble friend when he introduced the amendments&#151;is that in Northern Ireland, where much less time was allowed for the introduction, there is only one electoral registration officer, whereas in this country we have, I think, 402 EROs, all of whom have to have been trained and be working on the scheme before it can be introduced.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000034"></a>One thing clearly to have come out from the Electoral Commission is that the performance of electoral registration officers up and down the country varies  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC404"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerably. That has to be sorted out. Also, if we are to start with a voluntary scheme, the Electoral Commission has to ensure that that scheme is working before starting on a compulsory scheme. The view of the Electoral Commission will be crucial and there has to be discussion with it about whether it thinks that it is necessary to put the date in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000035"></a>For all these reasons, I think that my noble friend is completely incorrect in many of the things that he has identified as problems with individual registration. It could increase the names on our register and the number of people who are able to vote; it is much more democratic and should help to reduce fraud. We shall come back to fraud in other debates; I am not going to talk about postal votes, as that is a separate issue. If we can succeed in improving the level of registration in this country, I think that we should support it.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000036"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051357000087"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Follow that, really. In speaking to this group of amendments, I specifically support the amendments tabled by my noble friends on the Front Bench, although I do not want to speak to them specifically. Like the noble Baroness, I want to respond first to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. I am not as critical as she was of how the noble Lord raised these matters, not least because the questions and problems that he raised on individual registration are in many cases legitimate. For those of us who believe fervently in the concept and the practice of individual registration, we have to solve those problems if it is going to work. I welcome the fact that the noble Lord raised those issues, because it concentrates attention on them.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000037"></a>I was not quite sure where the noble Lord was going when he referred to binge drinking. I thought that he was coming back to the practice of personation parties that I mentioned briefly at Second Reading, which fortunately I do not have direct experience of in Pendle but I have heard reports of it in other parts of Lancashire. In fact, they are not known as &#147;parties&#148;, but I shall not use the word that people do use, which involves alcohol and is alliterative, but which it would be unparliamentary to put into <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000038"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051357000088"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Could I give the noble Lord the exact quote, because it is quite important that it is on the record? When the Prime Minister was asked to comment on binge drinking, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051357000074"></a>&#147;We have taken action to tackle binge and under-age drinking and it&#146;s right that we do so ... But ... it&#146;s also right that we do not want the responsible sensible majority of moderate drinkers to have to pay more or suffer as a result of the excesses of a small minority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000065"></a>How very apt in this case.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000039"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09051357000089"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I heard what the noble Lord said and I hear what he says now, and I understand the point, although I disagree with it. The point that I was making is that there are things that involve binge drinking called personation parties, which are reported to me, whereby people who would not normally vote, who are from what might be called the lower echelons of society, are invited to come along to a particular  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC405"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>location, are given a polling card and told to go and vote in that name and then, when they return having done so successfully, they take part in the personation party, which involves the provision of large amounts of alcohol. That is clearly not happening particularly in the Asian community&#151;not in the Muslim community anyway.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000040"></a>There is no getting away from the fact, however, that electoral fraud, as it has mushroomed in this country, has unrepresentatively involved Asian communities. There is no point in beating about the bush in that regard. I am told that there has been personation in some West Indian communities as well. That is just a fact and, unless people grasp that fact and do something about it, it will continue to happen, and the people whose reputation suffers most are those people in those communities. However, I do not want to pursue that further at the moment, although I may do so later this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000041"></a>However, there are other forces around in British politics, on the far right, which I would not trust to operate our electoral system fairly and reasonably. They are not involved as far as one knows in false registrations and postal vote fraud, but the BNP is, judging by reports, prone particularly to fraudulent filling-in of nomination papers. There have been a number of instances where BNP nomination papers have been found to contain names which have been filled in by people who were not the electors who were purported to have filled them in. I do not trust that particular section of the British party spectrum to continue to operate the system fairly. It is not just community practices from south Asia that we have to worry about; it is the fact that, as my noble friend Lord Rennard said, as people discover just how prone the British electoral system is to being fiddled, more of them will do it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said that the main issue was in Asian/ethnic minority communities. I do not think that it is. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, that the main problem is the accuracy of the register. It is perfectly reasonable to say that this proposal for individual registration will make it worse, but the real issue is the accuracy of the register.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000043"></a>As far as Northern Ireland is concerned, I have never really seen a proper assessment of how much of the reduction in the number of people on the electoral register was due to the removal from it of people who should not have been there&#151;the ghost voters, for example, to whom the noble Baroness referred. There is no doubt that there was considerable over-registration in Northern Ireland, which appears to have been significantly eliminated. If so, that is a good thing.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000044"></a>Individual registration will help us to clean up elections in practice, but the most important thing is that it is right in principle. People&#146;s votes belong to them. It is surely their individual responsibility to make sure that the entry in the electoral register in their name is accurate, is in the right place and is not being manipulated by somebody else. However, it is not a panacea for postal voting problems. It is clear that in postal voting, where individual identifiers now  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC406"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>exist, people fiddling the system are getting cleverer and more organised. They are taking notice of the information that people now have to provide and have changed as a result. However, individual registration will help considerably with problems of personation at polling stations, the level of which, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said, we do not know. All that we have is anecdotal evidence from some areas.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000045"></a>To some extent, there are two separate issues. One is individual registration and the other is compulsory personal identifiers. Each could be brought in without the other. The two are being brought in together, which overcomplicates the issue. I would have preferred to see a system of individual registration, and all the problems associated with it, brought in first before compulsory identifiers, but other people will take a different view.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000046"></a>Some people are in a very difficult situation as far as registration is concerned. Homes in multiple occupation and other communal residencies are the classic example. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said that the people in them would be disadvantaged by individual registration; I take the opposite view. At the moment, who fills in the form in an HMO? Who fills in the form in any sort of communal residency? The answer is that, in some cases&#151;for example, university colleges and halls of residence&#151;it works properly. It is done by the college and by the hall of residence officially. But there are some who refuse to do it. They say, &#147;It is nothing to do with us. We are not here to register our students&#148;. So in some areas it works and in others it does not.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000047"></a>One of my reservations about individual registration is that, in that kind of communal setting, there must be an onus on the people running it to ensure that the system is working, to get the individuals to sign their forms and send them in. That must be added to these proposals if they are going to work, or these people will just be missed off altogether.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000048"></a>I hesitate to use the phrase &#147;doss house&#148;&#151;many HMOs are perfectly reputable and well run institutions&#151;but who is responsible in that kind of institution? Who is responsible in a large family? The idea of the head of the household has gone, so it is no longer them. It is whoever gets the form and decides to bother filling it in. In a normal family it is probably a responsible person who might be the head of the household&#151;or their wife, in a traditional way, because they are probably more efficient at doing it&#151;but it works. However, in many places it does not.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000049"></a>If you are placing that responsibility on somebody at random, or on a landlord to whom people might not want to give certain information, then it is a difficult situation. In areas like HMOs, if the council or electoral registration staff are efficient and do it properly then the system will be more efficient and better in every way for the electors concerned. Special efforts must be made in such places, as well as safeguards for genuine institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, nurses&#146; homes, boarding schools or whatever.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000050"></a>Some things will be necessary in order for the fears put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to be overcome. One is the question of resources, which has already been mentioned. There is no point in trying to do this unless the registration and returning  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC407"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officers have the resources to do so. I made the point before that there is already a separation of powers between the people who run elections and the council, but the council is responsible for providing them with the resources. That separation of powers needs to be strengthened to prevent political interference for whatever reason&#151;perhaps just to safeguard the council&#146;s budget, not nasty political reasons.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000051"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09051357000090"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> On that matter, no one has given us those assurances. The official Opposition have not said that they are prepared to ring-fence those resources, which is absolutely critical. If they are not ring-fenced, they will be absorbed elsewhere and there will be cuts in budgets.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000052"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09051357000091"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> This is the extent to which I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and thank him for raising these issues. They are relevant. I am afraid that I cannot speak for the official Opposition, and I cannot even speak for the Liberal Democrat Front Bench in this instance. I can speak for me and, like the noble Lord, I am saying what I think, which is the astonishing privilege that we all have in this Committee.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000053"></a>Secondly, the system of rolling registers must be reformed so that there is a genuine rolling register. We currently do not have one. We have an annual register which is topped up on a monthly basis by those who bother to do so, and those who are encouraged to do so by political parties when they go around and find that they are not on the electoral register when they ought to be. We need to move to a proper rolling register, topped up by an annual canvas, targeting the houses where people are not registered rather than the other way around. That could be tied in with the national core database.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000054"></a>As part of that, which may be controversial, people ought to be on the electoral register once within the United Kingdom. This has implications for votes in local elections, but people ought to say, &#147;This is my principal place of residence, where I am going to be registered as a voter&#148;, so that they are on the electoral register once and that is that. That is my personal view.</p>

<p><a name="09051357000055"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09051357000092"></a>Lord Neill of Bladen:</b> How does the noble Lord&#146;s plan deal with death? You have a rolling register to which people add their names&#151;spinsters, bachelors and so on&#151;and people die. What happens to the accuracy of the register? Does not that particular route open the door to fraud?</p>

<p><a name="09051357000056"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09051357000093"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> This is exactly what happens at the moment. If someone dies and the local electoral registration staff do not pick it up, their names are rolled over to the next year at least and in some places possibly to years beyond, although that is not supposed to happen now. This is why I say that the basic system ought to be the rolling register, which people go on to when they go to live somewhere and come off when they move somewhere else. One of the problems&#151;not a death problem&#151;is that people go on the register in the place they move to, but do not come off the register in the place they move from. However, if they inform the people in charge of the register that they are going on to where they come from, the people in  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>charge will send that information back to the local authority registration officers in the other place. That system should be tidied up as well. If you go on to the electoral register because you have moved to somewhere, you ought to have to say where you have come from and what registers you have been on previously. This will enable you to be taken off those registers.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000057"></a>As to deaths, many electoral registration officers scrutinise the local papers and receive council house information, council tax information and so on, and they manage to take many people off the register. It will always be hit and miss to an extent, but we have to get it as accurate as we possibly can. Basically, a rolling register with a system of annual checks and balances would be the best way to do it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000058"></a>I would also extend the canvassing operation throughout the whole year. Electoral registration officers have to employ all the staff who are willing to do this&#151;and they are not always easy to find&#151;at the same time of the year. It may well be that electoral registration officers could find people who are quite happy to do electoral registration work for, say, one evening a week throughout the year. In that way, the canvass could take place throughout the year rather than annually.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000059"></a>The third major point I want to make is that the system should be piloted, as I said at Second Reading. I share some of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. It is so important to get this right that it should be piloted not only in areas where postal voting fraud or other fraud has been seriously reported or alleged but in a range of areas so that we can see how it works and what the effects are. I do not understand why this proposal has not been put forward. Pilots could be brought in much earlier than 2014. Rather than having a voluntary system, which seems much ado over nothing&#151;it will create a lot of bureaucracy and will not result in anything positive in the next five years&#151;perhaps 40 or 50 local authority areas should be piloted in a range of areas across the country. We could then iron out the problems and see how to make the system work.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051357000060"></a>My fourth point is that political parties will have to get much more involved again in electoral registration. At the moment, if you asked the Electoral Commission it would probably say, &#147;We do not want to do this because it is all part of political parties getting involved in the electoral process and potential fraud&#148;. But local constituency associations started off in the 19th century as registration associations to make sure that everyone who voted Conservative or Liberal, as it was in those days, was on the electoral register. The register covered only a relatively small proportion of the adult population and it was crucial to get all your people on it. That was how they started off. When out campaigning, local parties should take much more responsibility on the ground for getting people registered. They should do that on the basis of individual registration, with the safeguards which have been put forward and which I am talking about, built in.</p>

I had assumed that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, would have something to say about Westminster. In the famous words of Willie John McBride, the Ulster forward in the British Lions team, I had intended to get my &#147;retaliation in first&#148;. However, I shall read carefully what he said. If I feel it is necessary to rebut any of it, and he refers to it on Report, I shall do so then. I have no intention of prolonging the proceedings by guessing what he said about my former constituency.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000002"></a>I shall say two generic things about my former constituency and one thing, which may be germane, arising out of my electoral experience there over 24 years. First, as a number of rude things have been said about Westminster, I say that when Charles James Fox fought Midhurst, he required seven votes to be elected; when he fought Malmesbury he required 13 votes to be elected; and when he arrived in Westminster he was confronted by an electorate of 6,000. So liberal was the franchise in Westminster, that after the Great Reform Bill, the electorate in Westminster fell because it had been more liberal than that which had been brought in in 1832.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000003"></a>My second point relates to the kind of constituency. I do not want it to be regarded as wholly typical of every constituency in the country. It is regarded by the European Union as the richest area in the European Union, due to a false statistical calculation under which it divides GDP by residents instead of dividing GDP by the number of people who work in the area. As 750,000 people come to work in my former constituency, that somewhat distorts the calculations of how much wealth is being produced.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000004"></a>Interestingly, and this is not surprising in an inner-city seat, the poverty statistics for my former seat are calculated by the percentage of households which meet the normal standard poverty indices. My former constituency was the 48th poorest constituency in the country and, therefore, it was a remarkable constituency to represent. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, would be doing the Grand Committee a mild disservice if he implied that it was typical of all constituencies in the country.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000005"></a>My third point relates to something which I heard the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, say. After the 1983 general election when, for the first time, the boundaries of my constituency went outside the boundaries of the old City of Westminster and took in parts of what had been St John&#146;s Wood and St Marylebone, the constituency had the lowest turnout of any constituency in the country. I said to my agent, &#147;I don&#146;t mind if we move up only one place at the next general election, but it would be acutely embarrassing for me if we had the lowest turnout in the country two elections running&#148;. Over the next 14 years, we moved upwards to where our turnout was the 25th lowest. We overtook 24 constituencies during that period, which I thought was an adequate effort by our canvassers. Canvassing in an inner-city seat makes me deeply proud of the British postman. To find all the addresses in an inner-city constituency is a remarkable achievement.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC410"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000006"></a>I march, in part, with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, in that the 24 seats which we overtook were all inner-city seats or they were in Northern Ireland. There was no exception to that at all. There is a problem which is concentrated in certain areas. That rise over 24 seats was also achieved against a steadily rising population. Again, one would have to look at all the figures to be sure that something significant was not to be derived from the fact that those seats constituted the categories to which the noble Lord referred, especially as inner-city seats are necessarily highly mobile.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000007"></a>I want to say one last thing about Northern Ireland. The noble Lord made much of the movement in the figures, and of course I understand what has happened in the past seven years. In Northern Ireland before the 2002 legislation, there was fraud going on, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, said. If you go back to the 2002 electoral figures, before that new legislation, you may well have an inflated figure from which there was a subsequent fall. I am not absolutely confident that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, made allowances for that in what he said.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000008"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051368000169"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> The actual fall after the legislation was 119,000. All that I have ever argued is that it is wrong to attribute that reduction of 119,000 simply to fraud in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000009"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051368000170"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I am not&#151;</p>

Something else came out when I looked into this. I looked into the famous &#147;brown book&#148;, where all the election results of Members of Parliament are, and I looked up the Northern Ireland seats. Something struck me as rather odd: in the constituencies where Sinn Fein had the opportunity of winning a seat, the turnouts were very high and electoral registration in those areas was very high. Sinn Fein is obviously involved&#151;now, under the new system&#151;in maximising the turnout and the number of people that register. That might be an argument in my favour, because it may be increasing the number of people registered who otherwise would not register if they were not nationalists.</p>

This argument could go on all night, and I have no intention of prolonging it. However, I shall remark on one historical episode of exercise of continuity. Winston Churchill, after the 1918 election, alluded to the glories of peace, but then said that when we looked to Ireland,</p>

<p><a name="09051368000089"></a>continuing to rise above the bogs and the mist. It was in Fermanagh and Tyrone that the charges of malfeasance were strongest after the 2001 election, which then gave rise to the 2002 Act.</p>

They represent one of the most significant developments in electoral administration for many years, so it is quite right that we should have debated it  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at length this afternoon and equally right that no doubt we will do the same on Report in due course. I do not know whether it will be good or bad news for noble Lords, but I do not intend to take very long this afternoon in responding to this debate. There will be plenty of time later on to talk on these matters again.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000013"></a>There are people who are very much in favour of this change. There is almost a consensus for that. But there are those, among them prominently my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, who argue passionately against the changes. That is just as it should be, but I do not think that anyone can really say that the present position is entirely satisfactory. What we are looking for, which is why this should not be a party issue, is both an accurate register&#151;that is absolutely vital&#151;and one which is comprehensive. It is the trick of achieving both those things that has eluded us so far and that is what we intend to try to see happen in future. I cannot see how that can be a party point; surely all democrats want as full and accurate a register as possible. I emphasise that that is behind what we are trying to do.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000014"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, the current system of household registration, with one member of the household taking responsibility for electoral registration, is out of date. It takes away individuals&#146; responsibility for their votes&#151;individual registration supports that. Thus far, therefore, I go with what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000015"></a>It is right that we carefully consider our approach and ensure that we are guided by the need to support and enhance both the comprehensiveness and the accuracy of the register. We can also agree that provision for identifying information on this scale needs to be handled appropriately. We have looked carefully at the amendments laid before the Committee today. It was interesting to hear views on Amendment 125BA and how consulting the Information Commissioner may offer some benefits in our move towards individual registration through the voluntary collection of identifiers.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000016"></a>We believe that the Electoral Commission is best placed to deal with matters relating to our electoral system, including the design of forms and administrative processes affecting eligible electors. That does not mean that the Information Commissioner does not have a role to play in the development of individual registration, and we have consulted him, and will continue to consult him, on an informal basis as necessary. For example, we have already advised him of our planned move towards individual registration and the collection of identifiers, which he indicated that he welcomed in principle.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000017"></a>The Information Commissioner did not indicate any desire to be consulted further, but we will seek his guidance and expertise should any concerns arise around the handling of personal data. In Northern Ireland, where similar provisions for the collection of personal identifiers already exist, there is no requirement to consult the Information Commissioner every time a change in a form or in the identifiers collected is needed. We do not want to place an undue burden on the commissioner, particularly given that not all aspects of the regulations will relate directly to information concerns.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000018"></a>I remind the Committee that there is already a<I></I>well established process of legislative scrutiny through parliamentary debate and committees. The House is in many ways best placed to decide when it is appropriate to draw on the expertise of the Information Commissioner, having the power to call on him to give evidence during the progression of any legislation through Parliament. I have set out our doubts about the amendment, but I shall undertake to consider further the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, between now and Report.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000019"></a>Amendment 126 proposes a radical solution to the problem. I am afraid that we in government cannot support it in any way, for the reasons set out by my noble friend Lady Gould and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, among others. It would be a mistake to allow for the collection of personal identifiers from electors in specified areas, targeted areas or parts of areas for a specified period upon request by a local authority to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000020"></a>The schemes would allow local authorities that have been subject to manipulation of the vote in the past or that anticipate a risk at a future election to apply for a personal identifier adoption scheme order, requiring electors to provide specific identifiers. On the surface, the scheme appears to offer some benefits, but, in effect, it would introduce individual registration in areas through the back door&#151;which should never happen&#151;without considering the impact on the electorate or registration rates.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000021"></a>Among the problems that we see are, first, that confusion would potentially be caused among the electorate, resulting in people being removed from the electoral register, and, secondly, that it would damage the electorate&#146;s confidence in the electoral system, which could impact on turnout. We also suspect that, because the scheme would be run on a voluntary basis, take-up by local authorities would be low because participating in it could give the impression that some sort of performance issue was involved.</p>

People would feel that there was something in that area that drew the attention of the world to them and that that was unjustified. I think that we would very quickly find ourselves facing accusations of, at least, discrimination against an area, whether or not it was one with many ethnic groups.

Does the Minister understand that there is increasing concern among ordinary voters at what is perceived to be the rigging of the postal vote system, and that, if this were put forward as a way of contributing to solving that problem, people might feel that they were being discriminated in favour of and not against?</p>

We would never hear the end of it. I do not think that that is the right way to approach this issue. I believe that we should move towards individual registration as a country, rather than doing it piecemeal.</p>

They do not say, &#147;What is the nation going to do about it?&#148;; they say, &#147;What are we going to do about our problem in our area?&#148;.

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000030"></a>In any event, the Government have already announced the timetable leading to the implementation of individual registration, which will be supported by measures to maximise and maintain registration rates. The noble Lords, Lord Campbell-Savours and Lord Greaves, agree that there is a degree of voter fraud. There may not be as much as they think there is, or there may be more than they think there is, but the fact that it exists is the reason why we want to take our time to ensure that the system that we set up not only gets rid of the fraud but also keeps up the number of people on the register, as we must. Our timetable allows us to proceed with care and caution and get the right systems in place. I will say more about that in a moment.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000031"></a>Amendment 132AA would require electors to produce evidence of their identity in order to be issued with a ballot paper in polling stations at an election. The purpose is to strengthen the security of the voting process at polling stations. Of course, everyone takes the integrity of the electoral process seriously. Voting at polling stations has traditionally been conducted without the need for any personal identification to be produced. Of course, it is an offence to attempt to vote  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC414"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in place of another, and staff at polling stations are given training and guidance on how to spot people who are attempting to cast votes falsely.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000032"></a>The report published recently by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Electoral Commission found that the May 2008 elections were,</p>
<ul><a name="09051368000161"></a>&#147;free from major incidents of electoral fraud&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051368000090"></a>It is consistent with earlier findings that the scale and volume of allegations of fraud have been decreasing. The police recorded 103 cases of electoral malpractice at the 2008 elections. Of these, 13 related to impersonation and in six of these cases no further action was taken. All this must be seen in the context of the 16 million votes which were cast at the May 2008 elections.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000033"></a>Any proposal to require voters in polling stations in Great Britain to produce identification would need careful consideration. The amendment provides for the Secretary of State to designate, by order, documents that may be produced as evidence of identity. However, we would wish to carefully consider the practical implications of the proposal and the barriers that it might present for voting at elections, particularly as the requirement to produce evidence of identity would be a significant change to the electoral system.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000034"></a>In addition, the amendment does not include any provision for checks to be done on the ID produced or for the details on the ID to be validated against another source. Again, that could undermine the effectiveness of the scheme. We understand that the Electoral Commission has indicated that it does not favour the use of ID by voters in polling stations at this time, so we have no plans to require electors in polling stations to require identification. However, this is an issue we will wish to consider in the context of our plans in relation to the electoral registration process, and we will look at it further once an overarching structure for individual registration is in place. We keep the matter under review and explore the options for ensuring that votes in polling stations are cast safely and securely.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000035"></a>Liberal Democrat Amendment 125CA provides the Electoral Commission with discretion to make an assessment before 2014 of whether the registration objectives would be helped or hindered by a move towards the compulsory collection of personal identifiers. In tandem, it also provides the Commission with the ability to make a recommendation before that date on whether the provision of identifiers should be made compulsory. This is in contrast to the Government&#146;s proposal, which requires the Electoral Commission to make such an assessment only in its 2014 report and to make a clear recommendation on whether or not to proceed to compulsory provision of identifiers to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000036"></a>Of course, there are noble Lords who would like us to move more quickly towards a system of individual registration, and it may be worth saying a word or two about why we have chosen the timetable that we have and put it before Parliament. A phased approach is the only way to ensure that what I have described as a radical change is made effectively. It cannot be rushed. Our specific timetable delivers on this phased approach. It has been developed carefully, with due regard to the  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC415"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>magnitude of the change and to the risks involved, some of which were set out by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000037"></a>It is a long time since last Wednesday evening, when we first set out on this group, but it is worth reminding noble Lords of why we are taking this course. There is concern about the timetable for the shift, which we propose should not happen before 2015 at the earliest. Given the importance of safeguarding the electoral system against fraud and the vital role that individual registration can play in achieving that, it is understandable that noble Lords would be anxious to make progress soon. However, a significant amount of work needs to be undertaken to ensure that the system is fully equipped to meet the challenges of the shift. We know from the experience in Northern Ireland, which did not start as well as it might&#151;although I would argue that it has improved a lot&#151;that there is a real risk that numbers registered could decrease as a result of the move. Under individual registration, many people will for the first time be responsible for their own registration; for all individuals, there will be a new requirement to provide additional personal information when registering. We have to ensure that the electorate has sufficient time to acclimatise to the new requirements.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000038"></a>The other advantage of a phased approach will be that it enables us carefully to monitor progress at each stage, including using the commission&#146;s annual progress report&#151;there is to be one from the commission each year from 2011&#151;better to ensure that registration rates can be maintained during the change. That will allow us to develop and test new measures to drive up registration rates, working closely with registration officers and the commission to determine what works best. Part of this is to increase registration at all times, as well as to move to individual identifiers. We will expect electoral registration officers and the system to work all the time towards increasing the number of people registered. That has been happening over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000039"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09051368000182"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I do not expect my noble friend to answer directly now my two questions. Is it true that EROs are paid on the numbers of persons registered? If so, will that arise under this new arrangement? In other words, are they paid on the numbers that they manage and the local authority has registered? Perhaps my noble friend will drop me a note about that. Furthermore, will there not be an incentive in some areas for EROs to leave on the register electors who have moved on, for whatever reason, to compensate for failure to gather new individual registrations? Perhaps my noble friend will also comment on that in writing.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000040"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09051368000183"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Of course, I shall write to my noble friend with the answer to the first question, but for an ERO to do the second thing would be in breach of every part of the responsibilities of the job, which is surely to form as accurate a register as he or she possibly can for the area for which they are responsible. I shall write on the first point, but I would have thought that the ERO was paid as a local government officer under normal terms and conditions. I see those who are still very much active in local government nodding.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000041"></a>As to the dates and their relationship to elections, let me repeat what I said last week. Should the shift to compulsory provision of identifiers take place in 2015, it would take place after both the 2014 European parliamentary elections and the spring 2015 elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of course, we do not know the dates of future general elections, but I was very interested in the hypothesis that the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, put forward in the debate. Placing the potential change in that time frame would manage partially the risk of making a shift in the period immediately before a national or sub-national election. We think that this change is so important&#151;and it seems that the Committee does too&#151;that we want as far as possible to investigate all the potential issues fully before the provision of identifiers becoming compulsory.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000042"></a>I go back to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. The timetable, which is designed to give certainty to this process, which we believe is an important point, would give sufficient time for the public to acclimatise to the change; time for each and every one of the&#151;I take the word of my noble friend Lady Gould on this&#151;402 electoral registration officers in Great Britain to adapt to the new system and to ensure that all are working at the level of the best; time to investigate and test which public sector databases would be of most assistance to registration officers; and time to design the infrastructure of the validation of national insurance numbers that will underpin the system. It will also allow us to minimise disruption to elections by avoiding, so far as is possible, national and sub-national elections.</p>
<h5><a name="09051368000165"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000043"></a>We must take heed of the Northern Ireland experience. The registration rate fell significantly when individual registration was introduced. We intend to do all that we can to mitigate the risk of that happening in Great Britain&#151;that is at the heart of our phased implementation programme. The points that my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours makes indicate precisely why we need to make sure that we get it right in Great Britain. We believe that this objective is most likely to be achieved by building in time to ensure that the factors I just mentioned can be fully taken into account. That is what we are attempting to do. Accepting this amendment would put the successful pursuit of that objective in jeopardy.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000044"></a>The purpose of the phased implementation is to ensure that we take the necessary time to bolster, adapt and improve the current system for registration in readiness for this major shift in the process. For that reason, any attempts to introduce individual registration at a faster rate might risk damaging the integrity of the system and, worse still, the public&#146;s confidence in it. If that were to happen in the run-up to a general election, the consequences for democracy and engagement could be quite serious.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000045"></a>The second amendment in the noble Lord&#146;s name is Amendment 125CB, which provides that, in making an order commencing the compulsory collection of identifiers, the Secretary of State must have regard to any recommendation by the Electoral Commission of any system changes that are needed ahead of the shift  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC417"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to compulsory individual registration. The amendment proposes that, in that event, the Secretary of State should have the power to make an order to amend the provisions in our Amendment 125D, which provide for the obligatory provision of personal identifiers, in line with those recommendations. There would then need to be an affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000046"></a>In essence, the effect of the amendment would be to allow the commission to recommend changes to the system of full, obligatory individual registration that we are setting in place in the Bill and give the Government of the day the power to change the system by order. These changes could be fundamental and might even include the replacement of the substance of the new clause introduced by our Amendment 125D with something very different. We have reservations about that proposal. First, the discretion that it would confer on the commission and on government would be very wide. Essentially, it would create a power to make changes not envisaged in this legislation and invest that power in the Secretary of State by enabling him to make secondary legislation. The scope of the power would be limited only by the Electoral Commission&#146;s views, and that might hand the initiative to the commission from Parliament in quite a novel way.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000047"></a>Secondly, it is not clear how such recommendations by the commission for changes would interact with the recommendation that the commission is required to make in 2014 as to whether the provision of identifying information should be made obligatory. A positive recommendation under that subsection would trigger an affirmative order to commence the provisions, but what would the situation be if the commission should make such a recommendation conditional on other steps that it had recommended under this amendment? What would be the most appropriate course for government and Parliament if it was felt that any such conditions set by the commission, though well intentioned, were not sensible to pursue?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90513-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="90513-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000048"></a>A partial or conditional recommendation would introduce an additional and unnecessary layer of complexity to the test process, which as currently drafted is intended to allow for the smooth transition to individual registration. It is not clear what would happen if, for example, the Secretary of State disagreed with the commission&#146;s recommendations for change. The potential for disagreement to stall the process for transition is real.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000049"></a>There is also a risk that the conditional nature of the recommendation could undermine its strength. Under our proposals, if a recommendation is made to move to individual registration, the Secretary of State must put it to Parliament for a vote. However, if the recommendation is conditional, it may follow that the nature of the obligation to do something in response to it feels less robust.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000050"></a>Thirdly, the amendment would shift the focus of the commission&#146;s role in an important and undesirable way. The commission&#146;s views on what changes to the system might be necessary are helpful&#151;that is why we have asked it to include in its annual reports an assessment of what changes it thinks might be needed. But that is different from a power to make formal

That goes towards handing the initiative in designing the system to the commission, when it is properly for government and Parliament.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000051"></a>Nor are we sure that the amendment is necessary. It indicates that the Secretary of State &#147;must have regard to&#148; the recommendations of the Electoral Commission in making an order allowing the shift to the obligatory provision of identifiers. However, the Secretary of State&#151;and, more importantly, Parliament&#151;would at any rate take into account the commission&#146;s assessment of the system&#146;s readiness for change. It is the commission&#146;s assessment that unlocks the process. That is why the tests are in the Bill, placing the Electoral Commission and Parliament at the heart of the change but making a proper distinction between their roles. That is why we are not content with the amendment as it stands and I invite the noble Lord not to press it.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000054"></a>It is a transparency amendment in that it provides the public with increased information on candidates. When Members of Parliament are first elected, they are immediately required to register their interests in the Register of Members&#146; Interests in the other place. In doing so, they are effectively signing up to a code of conduct which requires them to accept that their conduct will meet the seven general principles of conduct as identified by the Committee on Standards in Public Life as applying to the holders of public office. They are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000055"></a>I believe that every candidate for election to Parliament should sign up to these principles prior to possible election. Practical application of these rules would require a candidate to submit a registration of interests  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC425"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC425</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>return to the returning officer at the time of submitting the nomination papers. A returning officer would have that document, signed, available for public scrutiny if required.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000056"></a>This system would have a number of advantages: first, it would provide greater transparency in relation to those standing for public office; secondly, it would enable the electorate to establish whether MPs were using public office, if elected, to secure outside employment; thirdly, it would concentrate candidates&#146; minds on the standards required of those seeking public office; and, fourthly, it would enable the electorate to better understand the commitment of a Member of Parliament to public service, if elected.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000057"></a>Some argue that Members of Parliament should not have outside employment, but I do not. I argue only that the public are entitled to know what the position of a candidate is if he or she is elected. It was very interesting that last night on &#147;Newsnight&#148; Mr Tony Benn was interviewed, together with someone whom I cannot remember, and he mentioned this principle during his contribution to the programme. After a lifetime in the House of Commons, he obviously subscribes to the view that there should be registration of candidates&#146; interests. My view is very simple: we need to restore public confidence in the system and I believe that this amendment, if agreed, would do that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000058"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051368000189"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> Perhaps it would be appropriate to say a word about the context. I have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has said about openness and transparency, for very obvious reasons. At Second Reading, some of us expressed considerable concern about what we might call the serious reputational crisis of Parliament and politics. Since this Grand Committee has met, that crisis has deepened and, in fact, is now dire. The warnings given during Second Reading&#151;not just by my noble friend Lord Rennard and me but by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson, Lord Marland and, indeed, Lord Campbell-Savours&#151;were substantial. If the Minister is not fully aware of the crisis that we are facing and the extent to which this Bill might be able to meet it, then I do not think he ever will be. I do not believe that he is in denial but I think that some of his colleagues in the Government are still extraordinarily complacent. If we are always going to have to try to rely on the consensus of the lowest common denominator in order to move forward, I do not think that we will meet the crisis that is clearly there in terms of our reputation.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000059"></a>My problem with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is not the purpose, which I think is admirable, but the practice. He is right that the explosive mixture of money and politics, which is at the heart of so many of our current reputational problems, is appropriate in terms of candidates and their concerns. However, if we were to accept the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, how exactly would it work? The Electoral Commission has already raised a number of concerns. It says, for example, that compiling and publishing these reports would place a significant new burden on both candidates and returning officers. At what point in the process would that have to happen? Would it take place following  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC426"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC426</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nomination, when the electoral registration officers&#146; teams are absolutely flat out? Presumably, it would cause extreme difficulties in terms of the timescale.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000060"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051368000190"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Perhaps I could answer that, although I have not seen the Electoral Commission&#146;s brief on any of these issues. The information would not be generally disseminated but it would be available. The press journalists would turn up, as they do on nomination day, look at the nomination papers and take from them whatever information they needed. It is not a question of widely disseminating the information.</p>
<h5><a name="09051368000166"></a>6 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051368000061"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051368000191"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> That immediately takes me to the next point that the Electoral Commission raised. It is not clear what the consequences would be if a candidate failed to make an accurate report, or if a returning officer failed to publish the report. In what format would that report be made available? Nor is it clear who would be able to provide candidates with advice on complying with the full range of reporting requirements that would be involved, given that the requirements of the House of Commons are quite wide-ranging but are not definitive, and they do change.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000062"></a>There is a wider issue, which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, made oblique reference to. Are we to understand that candidates should seek to divest themselves of any interests before election that might in any way impede, constrict or constrain their role as a representative post-election? That would be a completely novel procedure. To take an example&#151;we all have personal examples&#151;I never inherited a safe seat, so I was working flat out, trying to earn my living, right up to the date on which I was nominated, both in my original constituency and then, when the boundaries were redrawn, in my second constituency. From the point of view of the electorate, would the fact that I had a professional interest be held to stand against me compared with the full-time incumbent, who, presumably, having already signed up to the House of Commons rules, would be thought to be well above any such personal pecuniary interest?</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000063"></a>This is a dangerous tendency. It is attractive at first sight, but it would discourage people from entering parliamentary politics. Goodness knows, at the moment a lot of people are going to be discouraged from doing so by all that is going on, but it would discourage them further if it were thought that only full-time politicians who did not have a business, professional or trade interest already or have experience in that field, but who had a lot of private money or money from some other source, would escape the scrutiny of the electorate. There is already the problem&#151;other noble Lords might agree&#151;that too many people come to the House of Commons without direct experience of real life and without having a trade, profession or business that would give them good, substantial reasons for becoming a good representative of their local community. If this proposal were to be a further disincentive to those people, it would be a considerable step backwards.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000064"></a>It is attractive that we should be more open and transparent. In the end, the electorate are extremely effective at identifying whether the people who stand

<p><a name="09051368000065"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051368000192"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I cannot understand why the noble Lord wants to publish a Member&#146;s address but not their source of employment.</p>

All I am saying is that there would be practical difficulties in doing this, and there could well be a further disincentive for candidates who were experienced and already had a business or trade, whatever it may be. It is all too attractive to support the incumbent against the challenger, and this is just another way in which the incumbent, who is given a great deal of support already, may be given an unfair advantage, if his or her opponent is going to be forced to try to look as if they are above any sort of interest.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000067"></a>I do not want to sound as if I am against the specific purpose of the amendment; I am not, as I hope I am indicating. But I believe that the way the noble Lord has framed his amendment is not going to advance open and transparent local politics; it might even do the reverse.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000068"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051368000194"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> I support the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on this issue. There is certainly a big reputational problem with the other place at this moment, which it has to meet, but the amendment is not the answer to that problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, this will ultimately discriminate against people who have business interests when they are standing against an incumbent who can say that he is a professional politician and does nothing but devote his time to looking after his constituents. Also, this is only a description of somebody at a moment in time: that of the election. If that candidate then loses the election, presumably he hopes but cannot guarantee&#151;because the sympathy of employers cannot necessarily be counted upon these days&#151;to go back into the job that he was doing before the election. If, on the other hand, he wins the election and is part of the management of a large organisation, he may well cease to work for it anyway because he cannot devote the time to it upon becoming a Member of Parliament.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000069"></a>This has no relevance whatsoever. It is of interest to know what profession or part of working life a candidate comes from but, beyond that, it does not add to the situation in any way. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, says, it will discourage people who know about something other than just politics from coming into the other place, that is regrettable. We are moving towards more professional politicians. One sees on the government Benches in the other place a lot of people who have never really had any experience of professional life in terms of earning money or doing anything constructive of that sort. It has not been a very good Government, and I hope that we can move to having people who really do know how to run things if there is a change at the election next year.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000070"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051368000195"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My noble friend is seeking to increase the information available to electors about candidates&#146;  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC428"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pecuniary interests at UK parliamentary elections, and to bring the reporting requirements for candidates into line with those for Members of Parliament. We appreciate the principle that my noble friend is pursuing and the intention behind his amendment. Transparency is a key feature of the Bill. However, for the same reasons set out by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, we are not prepared to accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000071"></a>The practical implications of creating a register such as that proposed in the middle of an election campaign are considerable. This is particularly true given the short timetable for UK parliamentary elections. At present, the legislation requires that the returning officer collates the candidate&#146;s particulars. To go beyond this and require the returning officer to collate all interests of the candidate would introduce unnecessary complexity into the electoral process, as well as introducing a further burden on a returning officer.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000072"></a>The question of whether an interest is subject to registration or not is likely to be complex and subjective and it is not clear who would adjudicate. Even if the returning officer were to take the information provided at face value, the ensuing debate is perhaps likely to distract a returning officer from the task of administering the election at a point in time when he or she might be under considerable pressure. There are also risks inherent in formalising the declaration of interests in the manner proposed, rather than, as now, relying on the campaign to bring information of genuine significance to the fore.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000073"></a>Another effect would be that the significance of an inadvertent error might be magnified and, in the short and feverish campaign period, this could unfairly compromise a candidate and may even affect the result. I remind the Committee that this might be made all the more likely given that candidates might have as little as six working days to prepare the information, which is perhaps unfair given that Members of Parliament have three months from the date of their election to complete their return. If no one were to police the register, we would, as now, essentially be dependent on the scrutiny of competing candidates to inform the elector of contested and controversial interests.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000074"></a>There is a danger of real confusion, too. The amendment suggests that all relevant interests,</p>
<ul><a name="09051368000162"></a>&#147;which the candidate receives which might reasonably be thought by others to influence the candidate&#146;s actions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051368000091"></a>should be disclosed. This implies that it is up to the candidate to decide what influence certain interests might have. Introducing a layer of subjective judgment such as this might lead to inconsistent application of the rules and undermine the value of the exercise. In fact, it might make it more harmful than if there was no disclosure at all.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000075"></a>The Representation of the People Act already requires information about donations above certain thresholds received by candidates to be declared. Although that information might not be publicly available until after the election, it is none the less available. The advantage of the existing requirements is that they are long standing, well understood and clear. The Government&#146;s view is that that while the amendment is of truly noble   


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC429"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intent, it would not be effective in practice and would certainly need a lot more work before it could be considered by us in the context of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000076"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051368000196"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I have listened to the protests of those who object to this amendment not in principle but to the detail of how I proposed it. The registration that I am asking for does not necessarily have to follow all the categories set out in the House of Commons registration form. It could be selective. It could show employment and directorships. It need not necessarily show major shareholdings, but it should certainly show employment and non-executive directorships.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000077"></a>As to whether it would be an onerous task on returning officers and those making the declarations, it is very simple to get advice from the regional office. In one phone call, the regional office could give sufficient information to fill in the minority of categories that I referred to during the course of my contribution. After spending 22 years in the Commons, it dawned on me that some people used that place to pick up outside jobs. They do not come in with them: they gain them when they are in there. They use the system of being a Member of Parliament to secure employment. It is perfectly reasonable for the electorate to know where it stands in advance of being elected as against what subsequently happens.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000078"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051368000197"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has just given the game away. Clearly, you only get the job once you get in. In 14 years of being in the House of Commons nobody ever offered me a job. I had to give up all my other earning because I found it a full-time job. He is now saying that those who get in are the problem, but his amendment deals with those who are seeking to get in and challenging those who are in there. He is already qualifying what he said. In his amendment, the noble Lord mentions &#147;any pecuniary interest&#148;. He is now backing off that and he must accept that we all understand his honourable intentions, but this will not work.</p>

I am putting a proposition. I am standing on my feet and offering a compromise, but the Committee is not picking up my proposal. The reason why it is important to know both before and after is that it concentrates the mind of the person elected on what they originally told the electorate their activity would be when they got into Parliament and the electorate would be able to measure to what exact extent the MP has met any undertakings that might have been given. Members of Parliament might be less inclined to gather a list of 20 directorships once they are elected if they knew that their electorates might consider those matters as significant when they go to the polling booths. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000081"></a>Amendment 128 seeks to insert a provision that personal identifiers verification must happen in 100 per cent of postal votes and not only 20 per cent as a minimum. Amendment 129 would do that for Scotland. Amendment 131 seeks to insert a provision which makes a fraudulent application for a postal vote an offence with a custodial sentence not exceeding six months. Amendment 132 seeks to impose a moratorium on all-postal ballots.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000082"></a>As has been made clear by a number of speakers, particularly during the debate on the large number of government amendments to which we devoted two hours, we are all concerned about the fraud contained in postal ballots and are very keen to see what we can do about it. The first two amendments are designed to ensure that all postal votes are properly checked and, given the amount of fraud within that system, it seems only sensible that that should be the case. I welcome the Government&#146;s comments on that in due course.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000083"></a>The amendment relating to bringing in a custodial sentence is designed to probe the Government as to whether they have any intention of doing this and to discover how seriously they are taking the complaints about the amount of fraud. We could go through all the cases we discussed earlier, quote from what Judge Mawrey said in the Birmingham case and so on, but the suggestion comes from the Electoral Commission&#146;s recommendation in its 2005 <I>Securing the Vote</I> report. The report stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051368000157"></a>&#147;There should be a new offence designed to prevent fraudulent applications for postal votes. The maximum penalty should be a custodial sentence in line with the penalties for personation. Voting fraudulently is already an offence, but there is no specific electoral offence of fraudulently applying for a postal vote, probably because the number of applicants was relatively insignificant until postal voting was made available on demand in Great Britain. A new offence, with appropriate publicity surrounding is availability and use, would have some deterrent value, and would also help to encourage greater public confidence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000092"></a>Again, I would welcome the Government&#146;s comments on that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000084"></a>As I made clear, Amendment 132 is probing amendment, the basis for which again comes from the Electoral Commission&#146;s 2005 report. It stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051368000158"></a>&#147;All-postal voting should not be pursued for use at future statutory elections or referendums in the UK, and the option of sending out ballot papers automatically to every registered elector should not be pursued&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000093"></a>I should like assurances from the Government that they do not intend to go down this route given the current state we are in and because of the ease with which fraud can be pursued in postal votes in what I will call the pre-IVR era. After we have achieved individual voter registration it might be possible to have more postal voting. At this stage I do not think that is the case. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000085"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09051368000201"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> We have examined carefully the proposals put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and listened carefully to his explanation. We have sympathy with some of his points, but not universally.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000086"></a>The Electoral Commission has said that it supports the proposed new clauses in Amendments 128 and 129. In its briefing it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051368000159"></a>&#147;We have been calling for a 100% verification since before the introduction of absent voter identifiers in 2006. Many Returning Officers already check 100% of identifiers but we believe that, in the interests of consistency and the integrity of the electoral system, this practice should be mandated&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051368000094"></a>Hence it supports its inclusion in the Bill. The commission then goes on to make a valid point that that would imply resourcing, which is something that the Minister will need to address.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000087"></a>It will be interesting to know, as I do not think that in the past either the commission or the Minister or the ministry has told us, whether significant concerns have been reported in previous elections when such a check has been carried out, whether it has been effective in identifying mistakes or, worse, frauds, or whether there is a major problem in completing the exercise in good order and time. We are very sympathetic to Amendments 128 and 129.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051368000088"></a>On Amendment 131, it is important to make it absolutely clear to all concerned that electoral fraud is totally unacceptable. Our anxiety on this point is whether we should simply use the threat of custodial sentence for that purpose, given that the prisons are pretty full of all sorts of characters already. As I understand it, the fine is currently set at its possible highest&#151;at level 5, at &#163;5,000.</p>

It is a new offence relating to applications for a postal or proxy vote, in which the maximum sentence is two years&#146; imprisonment. That is already on the statute book, but I shall say a bit more on that in due course.</p>

The Minister will not only be right but, in due course, he will be able to correct me. I do not think that we in this Grand Committee should add to the categories that normally have a custodial sentence; we should try to make sure that the fine is appropriate to the severity of the crime and is related over time to inflation. I know that we do not have much inflation at the moment, but it is important that it should go up and be an effective disincentive to anybody even contemplating crimes of this sort.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000003"></a>Amendment 132 is about all-postal voting. As the noble Lord, Lord Henley, knows, we are sympathetic to the point that he makes. We believe that all-postal ballot elections are completely outwith anything that we should consider in the immediate future, until the whole process of personal identifiers and individual registration is completed. The Government have not been as explicit as that, but perhaps the Minister can be now. I would hope that he could give us an assurance that that is not contemplated at present. However, I am bound to say that I am not sure how the amendment would deal with the situation; it is rather peculiarly phrased at the moment, but the noble Lord&#146;s purpose is quite clear. I was not entirely clear from his remarks whether he wants to refer to the new clause proposed in Amendment 132AB, which seemed to have some textual complexity that was beyond me&#151;or perhaps it was just not quite as intended. Although it referred to overseas postal communication in its heading, the amendment does not deal with that precisely at all. Effectively, it deals with communication outwith the constituency concerned.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000004"></a>Even at this late stage in the proceedings, this is useful for clarification. In particular, I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an indication of why the Bill does not follow the advice of the Electoral Commission on verification, which is a very important point.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000005"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051373000122"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Talking about old postal ballots takes me back to our lengthy debates in this room on the European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill in 2004, which ended with a record ping-pong session between the two Houses before the Government got their way and were able to organise all-postal ballots in three regions in the north of England, including my own. I think that we had six ping-pongs, so this is not new. I shall not say much more about that, except to underline the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Henley: namely, can we understand that at the moment the Government have dropped the idea of all-postal voting? If they say yes, a lot of us will be very relieved.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000006"></a>I am strongly in favour of Amendments 128 and 129, but, first, I have a couple of comments to make on Amendment 131 and offences. Because of the obstacles that have to be got through and over in order to take election fraud to court, it is rare for such offences to reach court and for there to be a proper trial. Nevertheless, when they go to court, quite often the offences with which people are charged turn out not to be the technical election offences which we talk about in Bills like this, but much broader offences, such as conspiracy.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC433"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC433</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred to the recent case in Slough, which ended up with a headline in the <I>Daily Mail</I><I></I>about Tory councillor Eshaq Khan being jailed for three and a half years. It does not warm my heart to see Tory councillors or anyone jailed for election offences. It happens in all parties but taints and undermines the whole democratic political process. However, it is interesting that most of the defendants&#151;most of the six people who were jailed&#151;were not charged with election offences. One gentleman was found guilty of personation and sentenced to four months, but most offences were conspiracy to defraud the returning officer, perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, which are fairly general offences. I am not saying that they are not appropriate in these cases, but they point out how, when they are looking into offences, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service find it difficult to pin down offences in the Representation of the People Act and similar legislation.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000008"></a>In this case, hundreds of false names had been put on the electoral register. Postal votes were applied for and then they were used. It was straightforward fraudulent activity. No doubt, conspiracy to defraud the returning officer and to pervert the course of justice were genuine offences. In relation to this amendment, it is interesting that the judge, Gordon Risius, is reported in the <I>Daily Mail</I>&#151;the source of all wisdom&#151;as saying that although there are currently no sentencing guidelines for election fraud, he was required to pass sentences that would act as a deterrent. Citing a recent Court of Appeal case, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000093"></a>&#147;For such offences, it was said that as long as they are proportionate and not unjust, deterrent sentences are called for&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000086"></a>That is a little different from the point of view being put forward by my noble friend, not wanting to fill up the jails. It illustrates the difficulty of taking cases to court, getting convictions and then deciding what to do.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000009"></a>Amendments 128 and 129 propose that 100 per cent of postal votes should be checked for personal identifiers, rather than the minimum of 20 per cent as stated in the legislation at the moment. The personal identifiers are the signature and the date of birth. My understanding is that the north-west returning officer in the European elections has written to local authority returning officers in the region requiring a 100 per cent check of postal votes. My question to the Minister is this: is the returning officer for the north-west making this decision on his own or will it be a requirement in the European and county council elections taking place on the same day? Is this a central decision or is it the returning officer for the north-west making a very sensible decision on his own?</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000014"></a>Yesterday I asked the senior election officer in Pendle, the lady who runs the office, what the experience was in Pendle. Off its own bat, Pendle has been checking 100 per cent of returned postal votes, or at least certainly since last year in view of the allegations and problems there have been in our borough. She commented that, while it takes time and resources, it can be done. It is a matter of getting organised. The process is slower but the machines themselves are getting faster. The software goes into the computer, the signatures are scanned, information on the date of birth is fed in, and then the pieces of paper that people put their signature and date of birth on are fed into the computer system. The computer checks them and decides whether they match or not. When they do not match, a warning is thrown up on the screen and someone has to physically compare the piece of paper that people signed when they registered for a postal vote with what comes up on the screen. The process takes time and resources, but it is possible to do and it works quite well.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000015"></a>Only five weeks ago I attended a count during a town council by-election and watched the process. It seemed to work quite efficiently. From a practical point of view, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that if it works in our part of the world, it will work everywhere else.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000016"></a>The other interesting thing, however, is that the system is resulting in votes being rejected. When the computer finds that there is not a match, someone looks at it and decides whether the signature and the date of birth match and a proportion are rejected. Again, that is a downside of the system. For whatever reason, the proportion of postal votes rejected is quite high.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000017"></a>We had two town council by-elections five weeks ago. In one case, where there were not so many postal votes, only 5 per cent were rejected. In the second ward, over half the votes cast were postal votes and people had been actively signing people up for them. We did not have a candidate in this by-election, so noble Lords cannot point fingers at our party. In that case, approximately 10 per cent of the postal votes that were returned were rejected as a result of 100 per cent checking. So 100 per cent checking is weeding out illegitimate votes on quite a substantial scale in at least these areas.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000018"></a>The question is whether that is a deterrent to people not to do it in future. Because of the nature of the thing, the people whose votes are being rejected do not

However, from a practical point of view, 100 per cent checking can happen. It ought to happen and I very much support the Conservative amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000019"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051373000127"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Noble Lords will wish to ensure that at elections, returning officers are required to check the personal identifiers on all returned postal votes. The introduction of personal identifiers has been a key measure in strengthening the integrity of postal voting.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000020"></a>Given the technical and logistical factors involved for electoral administrators in implementing personal identifiers for postal voters, we decided to specify that at elections returning officers are required to check at least 20 per cent of returned postal votes but may check 100 per cent if they choose to do so. We think that 20 per cent is statistically a robust figure for sample checking, and is a good indicator of whether fraud is occurring. If the returning officer considers that there is a real risk of fraud, he may specify from the outset that all postal voting statements will be checked. If the returning officer decides to begin with 20 per cent checking, that level can be increased at later opening sessions if evidence of fraud emerges.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000021"></a>Obviously, noble Lords&#146; comments on this issue have been noted. We agree in principle that all postal votes should be checked, and will wish to require 100 per cent to be checked when it is practicable to do so. A key factor in determining when it will be appropriate to move to 100 per cent checking is when there is deemed to be sufficient capacity within postal voting software systems to support 100 per cent checking.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000022"></a>At the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament on 4 June 2009, the regulations for these elections follow the provisions for parliamentary and local elections and therefore require that at least 20 per cent of returned postal votes are checked. However, as I already told the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, the regional returning officers have indicated that they wish all returned postal votes to be checked within each region, where the software systems can support that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000023"></a>We are supportive of these officers in wishing all postal votes to be checked where that is possible. However, it would be premature to mandate 100 per cent checking in law at this stage given that we cannot be certain that the necessary software systems are in place to deliver 100 per cent checking across all regions in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000024"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051373000128"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I recognise that there is a dilemma here, but putting on the face of the Bill that there should be a minimum of 20 per cent checking may make some returning officers retreat from their current practice of 100 per cent. That is a retrograde step. I do not know the administrative answer to this. Maybe it is something that could be dealt with by regulation, but if the Bill includes what would appear to be a retreat, that would send a most unfortunate signal at the present time.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000025"></a>While I have the Minister&#146;s ear, can he give some indication of the results of checking on a wider basis than my noble friend&#146;s anecdotal evidence? There is obviously a considerable difference between finding a discrepancy between the signatures, which may be

That is unfortunate because they will not know. But getting one's date of birth wrong is different, apart from somebody who has dementia, which is a different problem altogether. If it is always the signature that is the problem, we may have to think very carefully about the effectiveness of this verification.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000026"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051373000129"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I will be able to give some help about regulations in a moment. Regulations made under the Electoral Administration Act 2006 set the 20 per cent figure; not this Bill. With the funding that we are making available to electoral administrators for running the elections, we have made provision to cover the expected costs for administrators in checking all returned postal votes. Administrators will therefore have the flexibility to check them all where the necessary systems are in place.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000027"></a>We intend to review the experience of these elections carefully. This will inform future considerations. We will continue to work with the Electoral Commission, electoral administrators and software suppliers to establish whether it will be appropriate to move to mandatory 100 per cent checking of postal votes. That can be done by way of regulations. Just because we do not put it in the Bill, that is not the end of the story.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000028"></a>Evidence from the 2008 local elections in general is that the rate of rejections of postal votes is not greater than those without postal votes, and it is often lower, around 3 per cent. Those rejected are mostly due to errors by electors with the date of birth not matching between postal vote applications, as I understand it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000029"></a>I hope I have dealt with Amendments 128 and 129, the first two in the group, and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, is satisfied with my response.</p>

At the moment, spoilt ballot papers are those that have been dealt with and counted at the verification stage and then are found to have something wrong with them. Perhaps there is no cross on them or more crosses than required, or whatever it happens to be. They do not announce the number of postal vote ballot papers that have been sent in but rejected because of discrepancies in the personal identifiers. That is a different issue from what we are talking about, but it would really help to identify this if that was announced as a matter of course with every election.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000033"></a>Postal voting has been a longstanding feature of the electoral process. As the Committee knows, the 2000 Act extended the availability of postal voting by introducing postal voting on demand.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000034"></a>The greater availability of postal voting has generally proved popular, with many voters finding it a convenient way to cast their vote, in a way that fits in with their busy lives. A positive impact on voter turnout has been the result. To illustrate this, at the 2005 general election, 12 per cent of the electorate opted to have a postal ballot, accounting for 15 per cent of all votes cast. At the May 2008 local elections, it has been calculated that around 15 per cent of electors were issued with a postal vote. Of course we have to be vigilant where the security of the electoral system is concerned. A number of safeguards have been put in place.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000035"></a>The noble Lord highlighted the offence provisions at paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the 2000 Act, which concern false statements made in any declarations or forms used for the purpose of making absent voting applications. He is right that at present, conviction of an offence of making a false statement will result in a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000036"></a>Let me point out again that the Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced new offence provisions relating to applications for a postal or proxy vote. The new offence provisions deal with a number of specific activities and build upon and complement the existing ones in Schedule 4 to the 2000 Act. Under these new provisions an offence is committed if one of the following things is done with the intention of obtaining the right to vote or depriving another of that right: first, applying for a postal or proxy vote as some other person; secondly, otherwise making a false statement in, or in connection with, an application for a postal or proxy vote; thirdly, inducing a registration officer to send a postal or proxy voting ballot paper to an address that has not requested it; or, fourthly, preventing delivery of any information relating to postal or proxy voting to an address that has requested it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000037"></a>A person convicted under these offence provisions will be guilty of a corrupt practice and will be liable on conviction to be imprisoned, or to a fine, or to both. It can be up to two years&#146; imprisonment on indictment. If the conviction is on a summary basis the maximum penalty will be six months.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000038"></a>I appreciate that the intention of noble Lords is that strict penalties should be in place for persons who seek to abuse the integrity of the electoral process. I can reassure the Committee that a person who makes a false statement in, or in connection with, an application for a postal or proxy vote will be liable to a custodial sentence under the 2006 Act. However, I undertake to consider in more detail the relationship between the offence provisions which the noble Lord has highlighted and the offences that I have mentioned that were introduced in 2006, and perhaps revisit this issue on Report.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000039"></a>The purpose of Amendment 132 is obviously to prevent any future all-postal ballots, or certainly any in the near future. There is, in fact, no specific provision  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC438"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC438</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in electoral law for all-postal ballots to take place at national level. Rather, under Section 10 of the Representation of the People Act 2000 there is provision for pilot schemes to take place at local elections in England and Wales to test alternative methods of voting. This power has been used in the past to provide for all-postal pilots at local elections. Such pilots have generally had a positive impact on voter turnout, but, the Committee may be pleased to hear, there are currently no plans to hold all-postal ballots for UK statutory elections. An important consideration, of course, as was mentioned in the debate, is that the introduction of personal identifiers for postal voters makes it problematic to hold an all-postal election as it would be necessary to collect personal identifiers from all electors, possibly within a short timescale, for use at the election. This could be a significant task and there would be a risk that some electors would not provide their identifiers and would, of course, be liable to be disenfranchised from voting at that election.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000040"></a>We have set out and discussed at length a clear timetable for moving towards individual registration. As was also said in the debate, such personal identifiers collected for registration purposes could be used in due course for the purposes of postal voting and so would facilitate an all-postal ballot. Given this, we see no reason to close the door altogether on holding all-postal ballots, as they may be appropriate at some stage in the future. However, further legislation would be needed to give effect to this and we have no current plans to bring such legislation forward. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000041"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09051373000132"></a>Lord Henley:</b> Perhaps I may deal with the amendments in the order in which they appear. I am grateful that I had a degree of support on Amendments 128 and 129 from the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Greaves. I was somewhat confused at first by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who implied at first that the good people of Pendle would not be able to cope with the software systems available to them. One envisaged them in some dark age of information technology where they were still on clockwork computers or whatever, but I am glad to discover that in fact they can cope. In due course, having listened to the Government, we hope that everyone in all areas will be able to cope with these matters, and it will therefore be possible ultimately to move from 20 per cent to 100 per cent verification as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000042"></a>On the probing Amendment 131, I fully accept the Minister&#146;s criticism that it is badly drafted&#151;appallingly drafted, in fact&#151;if it makes prison a compulsory matter for people who commit such an offence. I also accept the point that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, made, that there are already enough people in prison; the prisons are bursting at the seams, as the noble Lord will know because he knows that the figures go up every month despite everything that the Government do to provide early release. We do not want to start putting more people in prison.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000043"></a>I was interested in the point that the noble Lord made about fines at a time of low inflation. It might be low, depending on how you measure it, but most of us who look at these things and at what the Government have done over the past year reckon that we are going

Still, that is not a matter for debate today; we can discuss it on other occasions.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000044"></a>On Amendment 132, on the moratorium question, I am grateful for the words that came out of the Minister&#146;s mouth when he said that the Government had no plans to bring in all-postal voting at this stage and had no plans to do so before there was a proper scheme of individual voter registration. One should always say from the Opposition Benches that if you can get the Government to go so far as saying that they currently have no plans, that is probably about as good as you can get. I therefore thank the Minister for that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000045"></a>I want to say a word or two to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about Amendment 132AB, which I am not planning to move. The reason I decided that I would not move it tonight but might come back to it on Report is that it has certain cost implications, and we all have to be wary of any amendments at this time that have cost implications. I will look at that amendment and possibly bring it back at a later stage, but I give the noble Lord the assurance, to speed up our progress, that I will not be moving it when we get to that part of the Bill. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I shall set out some of the background of how the amendment came about. Before 2001, service personnel were registered on the electoral register through the Ministry of Defence. That was changed to relieve the administrative burden on the ministry and apply a greater focus to local authorities, which were then able to remove those who were no longer resident. That period was marked by poor administration, but all service personnel were registered during that time.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000047"></a>The 2001 changes resulted in the number of service personnel not included on the register increasing quite dramatically. The number of service voters in Great Britain on 16 February 2001 was 175,475. The same figure for 4 December 2006 was 21,006. Those people, probably more than any other citizens in this country, have due cause to have a close interest in the foreign, defence and security policies of this country. Under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 2000, the time limit on the validity of a service declaration for service registration was changed by the Secretary

It was designed to coincide with three-year postings, which have diminished currency during the period.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000048"></a>The current situation is that service personnel and their husbands, wives and civil partners are able to register as an ordinary voter or as a service voter. Those based overseas can also register as overseas voters, but as this limits the type of elections they can vote in, it is not recommended for service personnel. Those registered as service voters are registered at a fixed address in the United Kingdom, even if they move around, and is therefore used for those moving frequently or deployed overseas. They are required to re-register every three years. Ordinary voters must of course renew this annually.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000049"></a>I want to quote some survey data in support of this amendment from the Armed Services Association. It carried out a survey that was published in July 2008. It surveyed a large sample of the Army personnel&#151;8,719&#151;and therefore I believe that the findings have veracity. It found that only 69 per cent of service personnel were registered to vote; only 62 per cent of armed service respondents reported that they were registered. Most worryingly, only 43 per cent of overseas personnel were registered to vote. Some 31 per cent of personnel who were not registered to vote said that they did not receive an electoral registration form. Seventy per cent of units had still not held a service electoral registration day, informing personnel how to register to vote. Local authority electoral registration officers are keen to ensure that service personnel continue to have the option of being registered as ordinary electors rather than returning to the pre-2001 mandatory service-personnel registration system administered by the Ministry of Defence. That is why we have tabled this amendment. </p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000050"></a>The proposed course of action in the Political Parties and Elections Bill is to amend the Representation of the People Act, specifically Section 15, to include a service declaration. Subsection (2)(a) of that section is removed, but it provides for the electoral registration officer to determine after a 12-month period whether or not a person is entitled to be registered. The effect of the above changes in the new clause would be to allow service personnel to continue to decide whether they would wish to be registered as individual electors or as service voters. Where an individual decided to register as a service voter, there would be an obligation on the Ministry of Defence to co-ordinate with local authority registration officers on the information that they maintain to ensure that service personnel are registered. I beg to move.</p>

Subsection (3) of the new clause would remove the provisions which give the Secretary of State the power to make an order varying the period. That power was exercised in the Service Voters&#146; Registration Period Order 2006, which set the period for which a service voter could remain registered under a single service declaration at three years.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000053"></a>As an alternative to service registration, service voters can register as ordinary electors when they are eligible to do so by virtue of their residence. The practical result of these provisions would be that those persons registered in pursuance of service declaration will remain registered as electors until the registration officer has reason to think they are no longer entitled to be registered, they cancel the declaration or they register elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000054"></a>On the surface, this amendment might appear to address concerns about under-registration amongst service personnel. However, registering service personnel to vote in one place for an indefinite period previously created inaccuracies in the electoral register, which led to the introduction of a 12-month limitation on service voter registrations in the 2000 Act. In practice this amendment would simply re-introduce the same inaccuracies to the electoral register, so that we have high registration rates, but low participation levels during elections because of the inaccuracies.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000055"></a>I reassure the Committee that we are serious about increasing registration rates among service voters. I remember with affection Lord Garden&#151;we were opposite each other for a number of years in the defence field&#151;arguing that there was too little registration among the Armed Forces. He did so with passion and effect.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000056"></a>Since 2005 the MOD has been working with the Electoral Commission to address under-registration among members of the Armed Forces. Bimonthly meetings are held to develop information campaigns with MoJ officials also in attendance. Each year a campaign is run around the same time as the annual canvass to provide information to Armed Forces personnel and their families about methods of registration, with particular focus being placed on the service declaration facility. The 2008 information campaign was run between October and November, and activities included sending a combined service voter registration leaflet and application form to service personnel in 5,000 military units across the world; holding registration days in each unit led by a dedicated unit registration officer; advertisements in service broadcast and print media; placing information on the Electoral Commission and MoD's websites; and providing additional guidance and tools, such as promotional posters and resource CDs to all units.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000057"></a>The MoD is not in favour of this amendment; it has serious concerns about it. It believes that if service personnel were registered indefinitely, they would continue their very mobile careers expecting to be automatically  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC442"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC442</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>re-registered in any new UK constituency in which they may come to be resident, and as a result they would fail to re-register when moving constituencies. It is the MoD&#146;s view that this will lead to personnel being disenfranchised because their registration details will be out of date.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000058"></a>We think that the three-year period strikes the right balance between encouraging service personnel to register and maintaining an accurate register. That is not the only reason for maintaining the current position; the existing regime allows that period to be varied by order if the view is reached, on consideration of the evidence, that a longer or shorter period would be beneficial. We think that retaining that flexibility is important. Furthermore, the annual information campaign run by the EC and MoD is encouraging members of the Armed Forces to register to vote or update their registration details where they have moved and the choice of registering as an ordinary elector or service voter is helping to maximise registration rates in the forces. The Government do not want to undo this good work.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000059"></a>It is for those reasons that we think that this extremely well meant amendment should be withdrawn.</p>

The campaign fought very diligently by Lord Garden is something that we take very seriously. He was a champion of this cause, which should increase the weight that these concerns are given.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000061"></a>The briefing for the Minister&#146;s response sounds as if the Ministry of Defence has contributed to that, but the evidence seems to dispute it. The Minister cites the action which was taken in 2008. I was citing service evidence from July 2008 that said that 70 per cent of units had still not held a service electoral registration day informing personnel how to register to vote, a commitment that was given. I am disappointed that the Ministry of Defence should regard it as an administrative burden. Surely all members of the Armed Forces ought to be encouraged to take an active part in the democratic systems and processes of this country. Whatever the administrative burden may be, it would be worthwhile.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000062"></a>There is a suggestion of a modification for those who are most mobile which I would like the Minister to consider. A form could be sent around on an annual basis asking people if they had changed their place of residence or address in the UK. Failure to receive the form back would be an indication that they had not. That might also provide some additional reassurance that the electoral register is kept up to date.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000063"></a>Given the Minister&#146;s position, I will obviously withdraw the amendment, but I ask him to seriously consider this before Report. We will consider returning to the subject on Report to see if it is possible to get a more positive response.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000065"></a>In simple terms, the amendment would abolish postal voting on demand. If I had more time to consider matters carefully, I would want to restrict postal voting further than that. I hope that the country will look seriously at advanced voting systems as an alternative to postal voting, of the kind that we discovered to our surprise are pretty widespread in the United States, which restricts postal voting to grounds of infirmity and illness. However, that is not what the amendment would do. It would abolish postal voting on demand, which was introduced in 2000 with the best of intentions. It has proved to be a system that is wide open to electoral fraud, corruption and fiddling, and is a thoroughly bad thing.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000066"></a>In the previous debate but one, the Minister talked about the importance of the &#147;convenience&#148; of voting. I am interested that he is still using that word because it was almost predominant when we were talking about the old postal voting pilots that the Government used when were talking about the then Electoral Administration Bill in 2006, when I was ploughing the same furrow. They talked about convenience and increasing turnout. Unfortunately, there are unintended consequences, many of which I believe are unavoidable.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000067"></a>I was looking back through the huge piles of material on postal voting that I have received over the past few years, and I again picked up the Electoral Commission&#146;s report of August 2004, following the last European election, called <I>Delivering Democracy? The Future of Postal Voting</I>. The commission has carried out various surveys about whether people find that system of voting convenient and so on, and the Government have relied on that information. The report has a very interesting Table 1 entitled &#147;People&#146;s priorities for voting arrangements&#148;, and it was written back in 2004, before a lot of the publicity about postal voting fraud had come out. The question posed was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000108"></a>&#147;Thinking generally about elections, which one of the following would you say is most important to you when you vote?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000087"></a>The result for all adults was as follows: &#147;My vote being private&#148;, 33 per cent; &#147;My vote being safe from fraud or abuse&#148;, 30 per cent; &#147;Voting being convenient&#148;, 20 per cent; &#147;Voting being easy to use&#148;, 15 per cent; and &#147;Don&#146;t know&#148;, 1 per cent. In the over-55 age group, the proportion that thought that voting being either convenient or easy to use was important was down to a combined figure of 24 per cent. I thought that that was quite interesting.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000068"></a>My suspicion is that a similar survey would now be more biased towards voting being private and not open to fraud. I believe that, as a result of the publicity in the local press to which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, referred and also in the national press, and as a result of the national scandals that have occurred&#151;notably the case in Birmingham, various cases in East Lancashire and the recent case in Slough&#151;I think that the Government have to take account of   


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC445"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC445</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what is an increasing perception. A prosecuting lawyer clearly overstates the case many times. Again, I quote the <I>Daily Mail</I> of 2 May&#151;my favourite reading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000109"></a>&#147;Charles Miskin, prosecuting, told the court on Friday the action of the convicted vote-riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated. &#145;This week the newspapers are full of what has been called the swine fever pandemic, but there has been another epidemic that has been working its way across the United Kingdom in recent years&#146;, he said. &#145;Not of course a threat to life and limb but one that attacks, effects&#148;,&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09051373000088"></a>I think that that should be &#147;affects&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09051373000114"></a>&#147;and corrodes the roots of our democracy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051373000089"></a>He quoted the famous, or infamous, comments of Richard Mawrey QC, following the Birmingham case, about banana republics and so on. He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000110"></a>&#147;The systems to deal with fraud are not working well, they are not working badly&#151;the fact is there are no real systems. Until there are, fraud will continue unabated. The system for voting would disgrace a banana republic&#148;.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000069"></a>There is an increasing perception in this country, which I believe is accurate, that the incidence of voting fraud is on the increase. It may be said that it happens only in a few cases, and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said this afternoon that it occurs in only a few places. However, I think that it happens in more than a few places. I have a big lever-arch file full of these cases, which I add to over the years, particularly when we have debates here, and it is getting bigger and bigger. It does not happen in the majority of cases and it is not endemic throughout the country, but it does not occur in only a small number of places and it is not a small number of cases. In my judgment, the number of incidents that get to court are a fairly small proportion&#151;I would even say a tiny proportion&#151;of the total.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000070"></a>The problem with postal voting is that it is not secure. I have entertained people previously with quotes from debates on the Ballot Act 1872 and I have quoted Mr Gladstone saying why he was converted to the idea of secret ballots. In that debate, a Mr J Lowther proposed that postal votes should be allowed, that the returning officer should be allowed to distribute votes to people at their addresses and that they could return them to the town hall or wherever. There were warnings in that debate about the evils of proxies and canvassers going about armed with voting papers. Some of us have observed this in the streets; it is happening in this country today. The Ballot Act was introduced to abolish the appalling amount of fraud and bribery which existed before then, when votes were open and people knew how people were voting. If you do not know how someone has voted, all the bribery or intimidation in the world will not work because people can say, &#147;Yes, we have done what you told us to do&#148;. In the privacy of the polling booths, people can do what they want.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000071"></a>More and more safeguards and complications will be required if postal voting on demand is continued. That will result in more postal voters losing their votes because the more complications that are brought in the more people will fail to meet the tasks. The figures of 5 per cent and 10 per cent which I quoted earlier in  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC446"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two town council by-elections are serious. People are being encouraged to vote by post and some of the votes are being ruled out because they have not fulfilled the obligations.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000072"></a>I have no doubt that in at least one of those by-elections some of those votes were fraudulent votes&#151;I know they were. You can tell what postal votes look like when you have been around a bit. They all look different: people use different pens and some people tick or put things in different places. I am absolutely convinced that some of those votes in that by-election had been filled in by people other than the electors. I have seen them before and I know what they look like. Some of them were not stolen; some of them were ruled out because people simply had not coped with the bureaucratic system. The more postal votes you have and the more safeguards you have, the more that will be a problem.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000073"></a>Those who want to fiddle the votes will find more and more ingenious ways of getting round the rules. After the Birmingham case, I think voting warehouses will no longer be possible but there are other ways. There is no point pretending that the main problem is not in the south Asian community. I refer to the report published by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust in 2008, <I>Purity of Elections: Causes of Concern</I> by Stuart Wilks-Heeg of the University of Liverpool. He confirms that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000111"></a>&#147;Greater use of postal voting has made UK elections far more vulnerable to fraud and resulted in several instances of large-scale fraud. ... Public confidence in the electoral process in the UK was the lowest in Western Europe in 1997, and has almost certainly declined further as a result of the extension of postal voting. The benefits of postal and electronic voting have been exaggerated&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000090"></a>An interesting part of the report is the section on political and social geography of electoral malpractice. The combination of extended families with a fairly strict hierarchy and links to villages, where the village politics come in, and the biraderi clan system results in people not being able to vote as they want to.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000074"></a>My final quote from this report is not from a political ally of mine but from Salma Yaqoob, the Respect councillor in Birmingham, who talks about how votes are taken away from women in Asian families. That happens all the time. She says in the report that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000112"></a>&#147;Women in particular have been disenfranchised. Postal votes are filled out in the &#145;privacy&#146; of one&#146;s own home. But it is not private when family members, candidates or supporters, can influence subtly or otherwise, the way you complete your vote. Community leaders may claim to be able to yield significant voter blocs, but no one can interfere with the secrecy of the polling station&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000091"></a>Many young Asian women have complained to me that they are no longer allowed to go to the polling station, where they can vote how like, whether it is for my party or any other. I continue the quote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051373000113"></a>&#147;A secret ballot means that loyalties to families and friends can be maintained in public, but political arguments can still win out in the real privacy of the voting booth&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000092"></a>Those are exactly the same arguments that Mr Gladstone made in 1872 in relation to bribery. That is why postal voting on demand has had appalling, intended consequences. I beg to move.</p>

There is no question that concern is felt about the misuse of postal ballots, but our view is that the answer to that is right use, which is what we proposed though our amendments on personal identification and how it can be secured. There are two issues here: first, the Electoral Commission, whose comments we all take seriously, says that it continues to support the availability of postal voting on demand in Great Britain, but that changes to improve security and reliability of postal voting are none the less essential. We agree with that. It is a question of mechanism. Secondly, the noble Lord&#146;s proposed new clause would place an extraordinary burden on the returning officers, who would be forced to adjudicate as to who is eligible and who is not.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000077"></a>My final point is an anecdote. One of my first jobs, while still a student, was as a voter registration officer and accounting clerk in European, local and general elections in the late 1970s. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, spoke about one particular community; I was the electoral registration officer in a pretty tough area of Gateshead. One of the problems that we had was husbands coming in with their wives to vote, peering around the corner to see who their wives were voting for and in some cases tearing up the ballot paper. Arguments would often ensue. So it is a problem that is faced by all communities, which is why we need integrity in the system and protection for everybody.</p>

I confessed earlier that we made a mistake in 2000 in allowing the extension of postal voting on demand without the proper safeguards that we should have insisted on at the time. Having done that, our real priority now is to make as rapid progress as possible with a system of personal identifiers to avoid some of the potential for abuse which is clear in the system now. We made some significant progress on this issue with the Electoral Administration Act 2006: we now insist, for example, on the signature and the date of birth accompanying the application to vote by post, and we have got rid of the witness signature form, which was sometimes an even bigger barrier to people being able to vote by post than the problems which my noble friend has indicated so far.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000079"></a>Five years ago, in the 2004 elections, I led the opposition in this House to what I called compulsory postal voting when the Government extended what they called pilots and introduced all-postal voting in the northern half of England for the European and local elections. I did so when this House defeated the other place on five occasions, an almost unprecedented number. I said in argument that it was wrong to have compulsory postal voting and that people should have a choice as to whether to vote by post or at a polling  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC448"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC448</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>station in the traditional manner. It now seems it would be quite unpopular to take away the option of voting by post but I emphasise the need to move rapidly on the issue of personal identifiers, otherwise we will have to return to my noble friend&#146;s amendment if we do not make further progress on improving the security of the process.</p>

<p><a name="09051373000080"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051373000143"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The amendment seeks to amend provisions in the 2000 Act concerning absent voting in Great Britain in order to remove the current availability of postal voting on demand. Instead, postal voting would be available in limited cases only and electors wishing to have a postal vote would be required to demonstrate that they are unable to get to the polling station to vote in person. It is an attempt to move the clock back to what the law was before 2000, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was, as always, completely frank about that.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000081"></a>As I said earlier, the greater availability of postal voting has generally proved popular, with many voters finding it convenient to cast their vote in a way that fits in with their busy lives. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, referred to the all-postal ballots that took place in some parts of Great Britain during the 2004 European elections. Whatever faults there may or may not have been in that, certainly the number of people who voted went up compared to the election before it. However, we are not talking about all-postal votes but the system of postal votes that has pertained since the passing of the 2000 Act. Postal voting gives greater choice to electors and I am concerned that the amendment, if carried, would deny many people the opportunity to exercise their democratic rights.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000082"></a>Of course there have been justifiable concerns about security and we have put in place a number of measures to safeguard the security of postal voting. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, mentioned the 2006 Act and the associated secondary legislation. Measures include the requirement for electors to provide some personal identifiers. If they wish to have a postal vote, identifiers must be replicated by electors when they cast their postal votes and are cross-checked. We have provided for new secrecy warnings on postal and proxy voting papers to do our best to deter any attempt unlawfully to influence another person&#146;s vote. Further, after every election, a marked register of those who voted by post is published, which will enable individuals to check that their postal vote was received. In an investigation, the police would be able to check with any individual whether they actually voted by post or whether their vote was stolen from them.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000083"></a>In addition, we have supported the work of the police and the Electoral Commission in improving police awareness of and response to allegations of electoral fraud, including the production of guidance on the detection and prevention of fraud. This has resulted in much more effective working between returning officers and local police.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000084"></a>The Slough case, the most recent, shows that persons who attempt to carry out electoral fraud will face serious consequences. The separate evaluation reports produced by the Electoral Commission on the 2007 and 2008 elections have concluded that the action we  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC449"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column GC449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have taken has had a positive impact on the safety and security of the electoral system. In addition, they found that allegations of offences at those elections were down on previous years. I mention also the joint report just published by ACPO and the Electoral Commission on the May 2008 elections and allegations of fraud there. They found that these elections were free from major incidents of electoral fraud.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051373000085"></a>I do not think the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will be surprised to hear that we do not plan to restrict the availability of postal voting. However, I emphasise that we are not complacent about this issue and that we will keep postal voting under review to ensure that our electoral system remains secure. Inasmuch as the noble Lord wants to see it secure, we are absolutely with him. I hope on the basis of what I have said, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

Whether or not the Government keep this matter under review, I shall keep harassing them over it and producing all the evidence that I can at all times. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, said that my system would be a burden on electoral registration officers. Well, it is just going back to the old system, which was not thought to be burden and would actually remove a much larger burden: the volume of postal votes that now come in. If they all have to be 100 per cent checked, which they do, then that would be the bigger burden.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000002"></a>The Minister referred to the increase in turnout at the last European election due to postal votes. He is quite right: there was a general increase in turnout. However, that part which was a result of the old postal votes was about 5 per cent. Let us get that in perspective: there was an increase, but it was not very much.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000003"></a>I hear what my noble friend Lord Rennard said. I am tempted to say that all political parties have a vested interest in the present postal voting system because they all use it to increase their stock of postal voters. The real point about postal voter turnout is that in normal elections the turnout of people who do have postal votes is usually significantly higher than those who do not. We all know that. It might be as much as 70 per cent to 40 per cent, or 60 per cent to 30 per cent, depending on the circumstances. So it is currently in the interests of all the political parties to get as many of their firm voters signed up on postal votes as they possibly can. I would argue that those are probably people who would vote anyway. Even so, the parties do it. My noble friend is certainly very good at it. There is nothing wrong with it under the present system.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000004"></a>It is quite true that there is a marked list of postal votes received. I was one of those who helped to persuade the Government that it was necessary. However, it does not tell people whether their vote was rejected because of the personal identifiers, which is the point that I was making earlier. They will find out that their vote was received, but will not know if it was counted or not. The Minister has already said that he will look at that.</p>

<p><a name="09051377000005"></a>The Slough case does not show that everything is working wonderfully. It was one of the rare exceptions that managed to get as far as court and a conviction, due to the real persistence of the Labour candidate who lost her seat as a result of the vote-rigging. I pay tribute to her, because you really do have to stick at it and it is not always very easy or pleasant. She did it then, and people from other parties have done it on other occasions.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000006"></a>The famous Birmingham case with Richard Mawrey was not brought to court by the police. If I remember correctly, it was the result of an election petition and the court case was a private prosecution. I think that I am right in saying that; I will check it. However, the local police in Birmingham were certainly extremely reluctant to bring that case. On the two registration cases that I reported last May, the local police thought that we had a cut and dried case of people who had been put on the electoral register over the years, despite warnings, who should not have been. I pursued it because it was the home of a Labour candidate. The police thought that we would get a prosecution. In the end it fell because the local police and the Crown Prosecution Service did not proceed quickly enough and ran out of time.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000007"></a>My experience is that election matters are not always regarded as a high priority by the police. They are better now than they were a few years ago, but those matters are still not always given the highest priority. In the infamous Pendle case seven years ago, the police admitted that they wanted to pursue all this evidence I had given them about votes being sent off to wrong addresses, but there had been murders in Rossendale and things like that, which had to take priority. I understand that, but it means that electoral allegations are not always taken as seriously as they could be.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000008"></a>Having said that, the Government are still being complacent. I will tell Members of the Committee what will happen to really put a bomb under the whole thing: when it becomes clear that one, two or three parliamentary constituencies have been rigged at a general election. Who knows when it may be? It may be at the next general election, or two or three down the road. However, it will happen sooner or later and, when it does, I am afraid that the system will have to be radically changed. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That clause amends the parliamentary election rules found in Schedule 1 to the 1983 Act to allow candidates at a parliamentary election to choose whether or not their home address appears on the ballot paper and other election documents that are open to the public.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000010"></a>As I made clear, the Government have no view on this issue, and it is our intention that there should be a free vote on that provision in this House, as there was in the other place. However, we must ensure that the legislation is technically correct. The amendments are necessary to ensure that if Clause 17 does stand part of the Bill following completion of the parliamentary stages, the legislation it amends works properly and is clear to those who use it.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000011"></a>The consequential amendments are required to apply the provisions contained in Clause 17 to the specimen form of ballot paper and the directions for printing. In practice, the changes will allow for either the candidate&#146;s address or constituency to appear on the ballot paper depending on the choice the candidate has made on the home address form. Aside from the issue of the candidates&#146; addresses, the Government intend to work with the Electoral Commission, the Association of Electoral Administrators and other stakeholders to review whether any further changes are required to the specimen ballot paper. Any changes will be made under the regulations provided for under Rule 19 of the Parliamentary Elections Rules. That is all the amendments do. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051377000012"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051377000035"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I certainly shall not repeat all the arguments that we had about Clause 17. However, I want to take up one point. The Minister reiterated the Government&#146;s intention to have a free vote on this issue. In the previous discussion in Grand Committee, I raised a question on that issue and the Minister&#146;s noble friend did not respond. I want to get this absolutely clear. If we do not discuss this in our House, the issue will never be debated. The amendment was not even moved in the other place; it was not even one of the group of amendments before the House at that stage. I do not understand why the Government feel that it is necessary to have a free vote in your Lordships&#146; House simply because it was a free vote in the other place.</p>

<a name="90513-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051377000013"></a>Having said, that I will take this opportunity to say how grateful my noble friends and I are for the way in which the Minister and his team have assisted the

We shall be even more grateful if the Minister manages to respond to some of the issues raised during Grand Committee when we get to Report.</p>

<p><a name="09051377000014"></a><b><a name="90513-gc0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051377000036"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I associate myself with the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, towards the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, and the team, who have usually provided information in a timely way&#151;with the slight exception of individual voter registration. We will, I am sure, have a vigorous debate again about Clause 17. The position of the Official Opposition is that this is a matter for a free vote. This matter has been decided by a vote&#151;if not a debate&#151;in the other place. It particularly relates to those who stand for elected office. Therefore, as the unelected House, we should not seek to impose our view on this issue. As a result, these are consequential amendments. Dealing with consequential amendments on such a contentious provision at five minutes before midnight in the time that we have available was a bit of a chance on the Minister&#146;s part, but I hope that we can wind up now and support them.</p>

I thank all noble Lords, particularly Front Benchers, who have taken part in Committee. It looked at one stage as though it would never end, but it is very close to ending now and we have got through a lot of good work. We look forward&#151;some with more anticipation than others&#151;to the joys of Report in the Chamber.</p>

<a name="09051347000003"></a><b><a name="90513-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051347000096"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Crime Reduction (Alan Campbell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09051347000004"></a>Today my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is launching a consultation on the new code of practice for alcohol retailers that will ensure the responsible sale and supply of alcohol in order to tackle alcohol-related crime, disorder and nuisance. The code will consist of a series of mandatory and discretionary local conditions under the Licensing Act and requirements under the Food Safety Act, with statutory guidance to underpin its implementation. We are currently taking enabling powers for this code through the Policing and Crime Bill.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09051347000005"></a>The consultation will run from today until 5<sup></sup>August 2009. We want to hear views, experiences and evidence from members of the public, those who retail alcohol and represent the industry, licensing authorities and the police who have to enforce licensing policy, and health agencies which have to deal with the impact of alcohol-related harm.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09051347000006"></a>The Home Secretary will report back later this year with the findings of this consultation and will then, at a later date, lay the secondary legislation to bring the code into force.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09051347000007"></a>Copies of the consultation will be placed in the Vote Office and the House Library.</p>

<a name="09051347000008"></a><b><a name="90513-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09051347000097"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09051347000009"></a>I am able to inform the House today of the outcome of the Royal Air Force study that has been undertaken to consider the future basing requirements of the Joint Aircraft Recovery and Transportation Squadron (JARTS) units as part of our continuing commitment to ensuring that the best use is made of the defence estate.  </p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09051347000010"></a>The primary role of JARTS is to manage the recovery and transportation of both military and, in some instances, civilian aircraft.  Currently, there is a team based at Vector Aerospace Fleetlands, in Gosport, which deals with helicopter recovery and transportation; and a team at MoD St Athan which deals with fixed wing aircraft.  The study was undertaken to consider options to collocate the rotary and fixed wing elements, to identify the best value for money and most affordable basing options to meet the operational and training requirements of JARTS.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS90"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column WS90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09051347000011"></a>Based on the recommendations of this work, I have decided that the rotary wing element, currently located at Vector Aerospace Fleetlands, and fixed wing element, currently located at MoD St Athan, will collocate at MoD Boscombe Down subject to trade union consultation.  Not only does this option represent the best value for money and generate savings which cannot be achieved through the current dislocated nature of the organisation, it also offers operational benefits through simplified command and control processes and increased operational flexibility.  Subject to the necessary infrastructure being in place, the collocation is due to be complete by late 2010.  Service and civilian personnel will be briefed on the progress of the move. </p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="09051347000012"></a><b><a name="90513-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09051347000098"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09051347000013"></a>I am today announcing that the Government intend to re-tender the contract for the Bail Accommodation and Support Service.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09051347000014"></a>The primary aim of the Bail Accommodation and Support Service is to provide accommodation and support services to enable the courts and prison governors to make greater use of conditional bail and early release on home detention curfew, in appropriate cases. The scheme allows defendants without an appropriate address, who would otherwise have been granted bail by the courts, to be bailed. It helps to ensure that prison is reserved for people who really need to be there, not people who the courts judge to be suitable for bail or who prison governors judge may be placed on home detention curfew.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09051347000015"></a>The core requirement of the current BASS contract is to make suitable accommodation available at relatively short notice; to seek to ensure that service users comply with the conditions of their orders or licences; and, where necessary, to be able to deliver access to a range of accommodation and life skills support services. </p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09051347000016"></a>The current contract commenced on 18 June 2007 for an initial period of three years: </p>
 to date over 3,300 people have been placed in the service; andon a daily basis there are over 400 service users managed within the scheme.
<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09051347000017"></a>I welcome views on how we can further strengthen this service to improve compliance with orders and licences and reduce reoffending.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09051347000020"></a>These amendments follow a wide reaching review of Part G of the building regulations and consultation on the detailed proposals in May last year and in the earlier consultation in December 2006 on the water efficiency for new buildings element.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09051347000021"></a>The main changes are:</p>
delivering on the commitment we made in July 2007 to introduce into the building regulations for the first time a water efficiency standard of 125 litres per person per day for new homes;introducing a requirement that baths in new homes are fitted with protective measures, such as a thermostatic mixing valve, to limit the temperature of the hot water, thereby helping to reduce the number of scalding injuries there are each year;introducing amendments to the existing provisions on hot water systems so that they apply to all such systems. The legislation and guidance also introduces additional controls to ensure hot water systems are able to resist the effects of temperature and pressure during normal operation and in the event of malfunction and are adequately supported; andamending the existing requirements on the provision of cold water to specify the delivery of wholesome water to key appliances and to clarify where grey water and harvested rainwater can be safely used.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09051347000022"></a>Copies of the approved document have been placed in the House Library. This document will shortly be notified to the European Commission under the European standards directive and therefore remains in draft form until we have formal clearance.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09051347000023"></a>In addition, we are also today publishing the <I>Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings</I> that will be used to estimate water usage for the purposes of both Part G of the building regulations and for the Code for Sustainable Homes. I have also placed copies of this document in the House Library.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09051347000024"></a>The department will also shortly be inviting bodies to apply for authorisation of competent person schemes to support the amended Part G and the new requirements on water efficiency. It is hoped that any such schemes would be authorised to begin operation on 1 October 2009 to coincide with the coming into effect of these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09051347000026"></a>On 26 March I made a Statement to the House on council tax capping. In this, I set out the action that the Government proposed to take, under the Local Government Finance Act 1992, against two police authorities which had set excessive budget requirement and council tax increases in 2009-10 according to the principles that I announced (<I>Official Report, </I>cols. 464-65). These were the police authorities of Derbyshire and Surrey. Both authorities were designated and the

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09051347000027"></a>Both authorities exercised their right to challenge these proposed maximum budget requirements and made written submissions in support of their cases. In addition, I and the Policing Minister together met delegations from each authority to hear the cases in person.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09051347000028"></a>I can now announce how my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government intends to proceed, having carefully considered these representations, and having taken into account all relevant information. In putting forward their challenges, neither authority has, in the Secretary of State&#146;s view, presented strong arguments as to why an excessive increase was necessary, or demonstrated that the pressures identified acted disproportionately upon them to any significant extent compared to other authorities. We intend therefore to take action in both cases.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09051347000029"></a>After careful consideration, the Secretary of State has decided to take the following action.</p>
 first, we will proceed with the designation of Surrey Police Authority in 2009-10 at the level of the original budget requirement cap (&#163;197,206,000); and secondly, we will cancel the designation of Derbyshire Police Authority and nominate it instead with a proposed notional budget requirement at the level of the original budget requirement cap (&#163;163,511,000).
<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09051347000030"></a>In the case of Surrey Police Authority, the House will recall that last year the authority was set a notional budget requirement in 2008-09 instead of being designated for in-year capping in that year. This allowed the authority to keep all its excessive increase in 2008-09, avoided the need for it to re-bill and gave it an opportunity to avoid setting an excessive increase in the current financial year, 2009-10. Surrey Police Authority has failed to take that opportunity. I am particularly mindful that I provided an assurance to the House during the capping debate on 9 July 2008 that the residents of all the authorities which were set notional budget requirements last year, including those in Surrey, would be protected against excessive increases in 2009-10. I consider that the Government must take meaningful action which makes good that commitment.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09051347000031"></a>The approach we have taken in nominating Derbyshire Police Authority and setting a notional budget requirement is equivalent to the action we took against Surrey Police Authority in 2008-09. It is intended to limit the authority&#146;s scope for setting excessive increases in subsequent years. This will be achieved by measuring future budget requirement increases for capping purposes against its 2009-10 notional budget requirement. From the actions we have taken this year, the authority should be in no doubt that the Government will take firm action, should we need to do so next year, to ensure that council tax payers are provided with adequate protection.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09051347000032"></a>My officials are writing to both authorities today to inform them of these decisions. Subject to approval of an order which we intend to lay before the House following the local and European elections in June,  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS93"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column WS93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Surrey Police Authority will need to re-bill its residents for a lower level of council tax. Derbyshire Police Authority, having been nominated in 2009-10 and set a notional budget requirement, has 21 days from receipt of the notification in which to challenge its proposed notional budget requirement.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09051347000033"></a>Ideally the Government would not be taking capping action, but the Government consistently made clear that we would act to protect council tax payers from excessive increases. This is what we have done. I am nevertheless conscious of the fact that local government generally has done a great deal to ensure that it does not place unnecessary pressures on its council tax payers. More than 99 per cent of authorities did not set excessive increases&#151;and the average band D council tax increase in England for 2009-10 is 3 per cent. The average household council tax bill is almost &#163;240 lower than the average band D amount, and will increase by just 2.6 per cent&#151;the lowest such increase since council tax was introduced in 1993.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09051347000034"></a>There is no excuse for excessive increases in council tax and authorities should remain in no doubt that the Government will not hesitate to use their capping powers to deal with excessive increases in future years, including requiring authorities to re-bill residents if this proves necessary.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09051347000036"></a>I am pleased to announce that the Government are taking the final steps towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and we aim to deposit our instrument of ratification with the United Nations on Monday 8 June. I will make a further announcement when this has been done.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09051347000037"></a>The Government have given very careful consideration to the views that have been expressed in response to the Explanatory Memorandum which we laid before Parliament on 3 March setting out the basis on which we propose to ratify, including those of the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report of 17 April. It remains our view that the handful of reservations and the interpretative declaration are required and we will now proceed to ratification on that basis.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09051347000038"></a>With regard to education, an interpretative declaration will be entered to make clear that the UK general education system includes both mainstream and special schools, thereby clarifying how the UK Government interpret the convention. A reservation will be entered to allow for circumstances where disabled children&#146;s needs may be best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home, and which means that they will need to be educated outside their local community. This also maintains parental choice   


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS94"></a><b>13 May 2009 : Column WS94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for schools outside the local community. The purpose of the interpretative declaration and reservation is to maintain the present policy and legislative position in respect of inclusive education.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09051347000039"></a>On freedom of movement, a general reservation will be entered in order to retain the right to apply Immigration Rules and to retain the right to introduce wider health screening for applicants entering or seeking to remain in the UK, particularly in the event of a global health emergency, if this is considered necessary to protect public health.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09051347000040"></a>A reservation will be entered in respect of service in the Armed Forces to preserve the position already reflected in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended (DDA). Service in the Armed Forces is exempt from the employment provisions of the DDA. This approach is entirely consistent with EU Council directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. Service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown are excluded from the DDA&#146;s employment provisions to preserve their combat effectiveness. The Government decided to exclude members of the Armed Forces in the DDA because Armed Forces personnel need to be combat effective in order to meet a world-wide liability to deploy, and to ensure that military health and fitness remain matters for Ministry of Defence Ministers based on military advice, not for the courts.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09051347000041"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum of 3 March explained that the UK&#146;s reservation in respect of service in the Armed Forces and a complementary one proposed by the European Commission in respect of its proposals for European Community conclusion (ie, ratification) would be the subject of discussion. Following (and reflecting) discussion with the European Commission, the terms that will be entered are:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051347000095"></a>&#147;The United Kingdom accepts the provisions of the Convention, subject to the understanding that none of its obligations relating to equal treatment in employment and occupation, shall apply to the admission into or service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051347000094"></a>This is a slight change in wording&#151;but the substance and rationale for the reservation have not changed.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09051347000042"></a>A reservation will be entered in respect of Article 12.4, which concerns safeguards for the exercise of substituted decision-making and includes a requirement for regular review by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. There is currently no review system for Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) appointees&#151;ie, people who are appointed to claim and collect benefits on behalf of another person due to that person&#146;s lack of physical or mental capacity. Those appointee arrangements are not at present subject to the safeguard of regular review, as the Government believe this article requires. The DWP is therefore actively working towards a proportionate system of review to address this issue.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09051347000043"></a>Ratification of the convention is our immediate objective, and represents the end of a detailed process.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="09051347000045"></a><b><a name="90513-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="09051347000102"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Margaret Beckett)<b></b>has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09051347000046"></a>I have today published a consultation paper, <I>The Private Rented Sector: Professionalism and Quality</I>, which forms the government response to the Rugg review of the private rented sector and can also confirm my intention to legislate at the earliest opportunity to improve notice for tenants when landlords are repossessed. These two initiatives together create a major new package of measures to strengthen consumer protections for tenants living in private rented accommodation. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09051347000047"></a>The Government value the private rented sector and recognise that it plays an important role in providing choice and flexibility at all levels across the housing market and so want to improve its quality, by increasing professionalism, driving out bad landlords, and strengthening protections for tenants affected by repossessions. Today&#146;s response builds on the high-level proposals in an independent review of the private rented sector by Julie Rugg and David Rhodes (October 2008).</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09051347000048"></a>Our proposals include a national register of landlords for England with a redress procedure for tenants; full regulation for private sector letting agents with an independent regulator to regulate all letting and managing agents; greater local authority support for good landlords and action against poor performing landlords; and encouragement to local authorities to create local lettings agencies.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09051347000049"></a>The proposals also seek to identify ways in which those who regularly engage with the private rented sector can support landlords as they increase in professionalism and seek to improve their stock. This is also a way to attract new landlords and new funding into the sector. The measures we are developing with the Homes and Communities Agency build on this by seeking ways to encourage more institutional investment in private rented homes.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09051347000050"></a>The consultation runs until 7 August 2009.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09051347000051"></a>I am also announcing today my intention to legislate at the earliest opportunity to provide better protection for tenants in repossession cases.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09051347000052"></a>At present, a gap in legal protections means that some tenants could be evicted at short notice if their landlord is repossessed&#151;sometimes with less than two weeks to move their belongings and find somewhere new to live. I propose to extend this notice period to two months. These changes are part of a wider package of support the Government have put in place to support households at risk of repossession in the current economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09051347000053"></a>In the mean time, lenders and government are working together to try to mitigate the impact on tenants whose landlords are in arrears including by promoting and sharing good practice between lenders through the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Very often tenants can be adversely affected because the borrower is in breach of the terms of his mortgage. Changes to the rules for informing tenants if their landlord is due to attend a court repossession hearing have already come into effect. We now want to ensure that in these cases where a landlord repossession takes place following the hearing, the tenant gets a two-month notice period.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09051347000058"></a>The funders group met yesterday and agreed that a further &#163;324 million of the Olympic public sector funding package would be invested in the Olympic village.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09051347000059"></a>The funders decided that a public sector approach offered better value for money than a deal with private developer Lend Lease and would cost substantially less public money in the long term. The terms of the Lend Lease deal had been materially affected by the economic downturn, such that it no longer offered best value for money. Previous releases of contingency (totalling &#163;326 million) have kept the progress on site on track over the past year.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09051347000060"></a>The decision to make a further &#163;324 million available to the ODA makes a total of &#163;650 million being made available to deliver the village for the Games.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09051347000061"></a>This further investment now means the public sector will own the village and receive returns from sales after the Games.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09051347000062"></a>Over the medium to long term, as the market improves, the ODA will seek alternative private investment and management for the village on terms more favourable to the taxpayer. At least all the additional &#163;324 million public investment being made today from contingency and savings is expected to be returned after the Games when the flats are sold.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09051347000063"></a>To fund this investment, the funders group agreed to release &#163;324 million of public funding from within the Olympic budget. Of this, &#163;261 million comes directly from the contingency fund while &#163;63 million is from savings made elsewhere across the ODA&#146;s programme.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="09051347000064"></a>Following a competitive tender process the ODA was in discussions with developer Lend Lease about private sector investment into part of the village development. Lend Lease has already been appointed construction and development manager and this remains unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09051347000065"></a>Lend Lease and its banking consortium were prepared to invest up to &#163;150 million of equity, involving a return to Lend Lease, and &#163;225 million of bank debt to finance part of the construction and development costs.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09051347000066"></a>However, the current economic climate has resulted in the private sector becoming more risk-averse and, for the deal to proceed, the ODA would have had to carry an increased level of risk.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09051347000067"></a>After careful assessment it is clear that the publicly funded option will provide the best value for money over the longer term.</p>

<a name="90513-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09051347000068"></a>It was also confirmed today that agreement in principle has been reached for a further &#163;268 million to be invested in the village through the pre-sale arrangement for the affordable housing element.

Through both the Right 2B Cared 4 and the Staying Put: 18+ Family Placement Pilots, which the Government are funding, children in care will have the chance to benefit from a stable family placement beyond the age of 16 so that they move to independent living only when they feel properly prepared and ready. These pilots provide the stability and support necessary for young people to achieve in education, training and employment. In addition, the Children and Young Persons Act extends the right for all care leavers to a personal adviser until the age of 25 if they are in education and training and places a requirement on local authorities to pay a bursary to care leavers who undertake a course of higher education.</p>

But all states are bound under the UN charter to promote respect for human rights. All states, including those that practise Sharia, have also voluntarily ratified at least one international human rights treaty under the UN's auspices, and are hence bound by their human rights obligations under the relevant treaties and obliged to submit reports on the measures they have adopted to give effect to the rights in the treaties they have ratified to the relevant treaty monitoring body.

We are concerned that women and children can be subject to discrimination in many countries where the principles of Sharia are applied. However, much of this discrimination is based on interpretation, tradition and custom rather than the principles of Sharia itself. Many Muslim states have signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and have committed themselves to eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and we urge them to do so.</p>

As now, local authorities can ask an academy, including the academy sixth form, to admit a child in accordance with their published admission arrangements. If the academy refuses, the local authority can refer the matter to the Secretary of State who, through provisions in the academy funding agreement, can require the academy to admit the child.</p>

This will be particularly important when considering the needs of our more vulnerable groups of young people, although the expectation is that local authorities, as with the LSC, will need to use them only very sparingly, if at all.</p>
