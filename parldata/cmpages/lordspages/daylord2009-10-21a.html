The longer answer is that that was to meet the commitments laid out in our White Paper published earlier this year, and it reaffirms the Government&#146;s commitment to keep all their promises on aid, and ensure continued progress toward the millennium development goals. We will reach the 0.7 per cent target of gross national income for official development assistance by 2013, and honour our Gleneagles commitments, and those through the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, including those on transparency.</p>

I heard the speech; I recognised two or three facts in it, but not much more. However, I recognise that we have a commitment, which I hope is bipartisan. We are seeking to put online all the required information. At the moment, we are looking at a timetable for doing that in relation to the sensitivity of commercial information, the protection of our staff working overseas on DfID projects and our need and desire to include transparency, as the noble Baroness said.

Will the Minister consider, as suggested in the recent report of our Information Committee, that the Government should publish all draft Bills on the internet and invite comment on them from the public? If that happens, will it not encourage people outside Westminster to feel much more involved in, and much more understanding of, the work of Parliament than they do at present?</p>

The second part of the question, in relation to overseas development, seems to be something that I very much support. We can be very proud of DfID and what the British Government have done in the last decade. If you look at our achievements, 5 million children, globally, have been educated; there are 100,000 new teachers; and 12.5 million people have better sanitation. In India alone, 500,000 TB patients have been treated and 1 million poor people&#151;mainly women&#151;gained access to credit. We have a very proud record. I am very proud of the British Government; I am very proud of the British taxpayer for paying for it; and I am very proud that it happened under a British Labour Government. I do not think that it would happen under anyone else.</p>

Is he aware that transport authorities cannot meaningfully consider such schemes until there is a clear timescale for making available the final guidance on quality contract schemes? This is simply delaying improvements for passengers, as the Office of Fair Trading&#146;s recent report considered that a remedy for the lack of competition in the bus sector would be to encourage the use of quality contract schemes to develop competition for the bus market. When does my noble friend now expect the first quality contract schemes outside London to be in place?</p>

There has been no delay in setting up the arrangements. The consultation ended on 7 October and, as I said in my Answer, the guidance and necessary regulations will be published by the end of the year. The reason why it has taken some while to move from the enactment of the 2008 Act to the publishing of the guidance and the regulations is that the Government have been working at the same pace as the local authorities, as they were asked to. The legislation is about local empowerment. There are a number of measures in the Local Transport Act to which the local authorities attach particular importance and it is those that have received the priority. However, it is now up to the local authorities whether they wish to proceed with quality contracts. Naturally, we hope that they will do so.</p>

During the recess I spent a day in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire with Trent Barton, which has signed a very comprehensive quality partnership with the two local authorities in its area. It is providing a hugely improved quality of service to the local people in that area, working in collaboration with the local authorities, particularly in Nottingham, where it has established its own smart card. I am not aware of the difficulties that the noble Baroness has raised, but I will certainly check, and, if there are any, I will come back to her.</p>

I refer to the woefully inadequate reimbursement of concessionary fares; the reduction in the availability of resources from local authorities for supporting the bus industry, to which he has referred; the greatly increased regulatory burdens on the industry such as the revised drivers&#146; hours legislation; and the proposed attack by the department on the bus service operators grant, which will result in the fares of those who do have to pay going up substantially. Will the Minister address these issues, which are fundamental to the health of the industry?</p>

The introduction of free travel for older and disabled people, which came in in 2008, has provided travel opportunities for 11 million people, is hugely popular and has reversed the decline in the use of bus services. The Government are providing additional funding of &#163;217 million this year, and a further &#163;223 million in 2010-11, in order to fund the concessionary fares scheme. The Government have also paid around &#163;30 million to local authorities for the cost of issuing the England-wide bus passes. This is not an industry in decline. As a result of the Government&#146;s policy, bus usage is going up and the industry is a great deal more popular.</p>

This is a matter for Transport for London and the mayor. He must answer for the consequences of that decision. The original forecast that he made of what the cost of that would be is so far short of the reality&#151;perhaps by a factor of as much as 10&#151;that he should be held to account by the people of London.</p>

There is acute difficulty in rural areas, where they have no transport.

It is a concern that the Government very much share. The Department for Transport supplies nearly &#163;60 million a year to local authorities in the form of rural bus subsidy grant, the purpose of which is to support those rural services. Some 2,000 bus services are supported in this way and that assists 38 million passenger journeys a year. The Government have invested heavily to ensure that resources are available for uncommercial routes, particularly in rural areas, and local and national funding for that is around &#163;2.5 billion a year. The bus industry has every prospect of doing well and the role that it will play in rural areas will, I hope, continue to grow.</p>

We are concerned about that rising threat. Yemen has witnessed a significant upsurge in al-Qaeda activity since Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was formed in 2006. There have been a number of terrorist incidents in Yemen, including against western interests, and we believe that terrorists continue to plan attacks. There is little indication of an influx of insurgents from Yemen into Afghanistan.</p>

From it, I think it is fair to say that she accepts that the destruction of infrastructure and local economies in Yemen and the creation of tens of thousands of IDPs have provided a prime recruiting ground for al-Qaeda. I am sure she will accept that independent panellists are claiming that literally hundreds of Yemeni insurgents trained by al-Qaeda have been seen in Afghanistan and therefore one must presume that they have been engaging with our forces. Given that situation, does the Minister agree that it is incumbent on the United Kingdom to take a lead role in trying to bring peace and stability back into Yemen through international aid and reconstruction in order to tackle the problem at its source? Finally, in that context, can she tell the House where we are in terms of the international funds that we are contributing to compared with other countries&#151;for example, Germany, which I think has given some &#163;70 million this year alone to assist in Yemen?</p>

The noble Lord seeks reassurance on the UK&#146;s commitment to funding. The UK spent &#163;20 million in the financial year 2008-09 and this figure is bound to increase significantly in the next two years. Our development partner agreement with Yemen has allocated &#163;105 million from April 2008 to March 2011. We also contributed &#163;2 million to the UN appeal for displaced people in the north. Again, I reassure the noble Lord that we, with Germany, are leading in the European Union as the most substantial donors of assistance in Yemen. We agree that the implications of an unstable Yemen will be felt by the entire international community. It is therefore important that we work together with our partners in the European Union, with Saudi Arabia and the United States, and that we co-ordinate those activities.</p>

Our main activity is supporting and funding the coastguards, who are doing a very good job in the waters around the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden.</p>

The Saudi Government are clearly threatened by what is happening in Yemen. In past years, the Saudi regime and members of Saudi society have not been entirely helpful in coping with the threat from al-Qaeda. There was a very good article in the <I>New York Times</I> the week before last by a senior member of the Saudi Royal Family about how we need to work together in combating al-Qaeda. Are Her Majesty&#146;s Government and other members of the European Union now in active dialogue with the Saudis on how we work together in this respect?</p>

President Saleh has to deal with the problems in northern Yemen and in the south, where there are secessionist movements which are claiming independence from Yemen. In the Arabian peninsular, the Yemenis are having to conduct a struggle against al-Qaeda, which recently carried out attacks. They also have very serious problems with their economy; they have to make tough, painful reforms and they have very poor public services. DfID is assisting efforts to ensure that they have a better education system and that they can improve their infrastructure and work against the increasing radicalisation of young people in Yemen. That is the mentoring process in which we are involved. There are many tasks and a big DfID programme with much collaboration with the Ministry of Defence.</p>

I shall not repeat the arguments deployed in Committee on either of these issues, arguments which were very ably put by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff. With her permission, I have tabled a similar amendment to the one which she tabled in Committee and I shall speak to them both. I remind the House that we spoke at length about the great difficulties caused when inquests are delayed. Over time, witnesses may become more unreliable, thereby obscuring the search for truth, and making families wait prolongs and intensifies their pain.</p>

<a name="91021-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09102132000068"></a>These amendments reflect the Minister&#146;s comments in Committee. They ensure that a monitoring system will be in place to highlight problems within the coronial system. If particular jurisdictions are struggling with workloads or resources and not completing inquests in a timely manner, the Chief Coroner would be able to take action. As the Bill intends to modernise the coroners service, the long delays suffered by a very few inquests&#151;I accept the comments the Minister made in Committee&#151;surely must be addressed. The Minister said that inquests should be held as soon as possible when all the relevant information is to hand. Some of the problems identified in the examples given in Committee were because various authorities dragged their feet in providing the relevant information. That needs to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09102132000069"></a>The Minister also argued that the Chief Coroner will be able to carry out the functions that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, spoke about so persuasively because the Lord Chancellor and the Chief Coroner will be given power in regulations to require information to be provided to them by senior coroners. If the Government intend to lay that out in regulations, why can they not put it in the Bill? Not having that in statute undermines the comeback that families would otherwise have to obtain a judicial review where an inquest has dragged on for year after year for no reason. Finally, it would focus attention on ensuring that delay in relation to deaths in custody or otherwise in state detention is addressed. Many of them address Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This issue has been highlighted year after year by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, beginning in 2004, and I remind the House that the committee commented in March 2009 that it had recently received evidence that many of the issues and delays not only remain, but are getting worse. I beg to move.</p>

I think we sometimes underestimate the importance that bereaved families attach not only to the results of the inquest but to the fact that it represents closure that enables them to put their life ahead on an even keel. We probably will not have another coroners Bill for 25 years, so it is right that we should take the opportunity to reduce delays in the opening and completion of inquests.</p>

<a name="91021-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09102132000071"></a>I am pleased that the Government have included in the Bill the appointment of a Chief Coroner with powers to intervene in specified circumstances, the introduction of senior coroners for each area and the possibility of some transfer between areas. Those are good proposals that will cut logjams and reduce delays. However, this amendment on monitoring the situation is a useful addition, and I hope that the Government will accept it. I know the Minister may say that only about 10 per cent of inquests last beyond a year, but that is a lot of inquests and some delays are very long indeed. This amendment demonstrates an intention to do our best to correct the situation and deserves government support.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09102132000245"></a>&#147;The purpose of the Bill is to establish more effective, transparent and responsive justice and coroner services for victims, witnesses, bereaved families and the wider public&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102132000232"></a>In Committee, the Minister said that the average time for an inquest was 26 weeks. That, of course, is not so for Schedule 2 inquests, particularly those involving prisons, the police and the Armed Forces, for which two years is the average time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09102132000073"></a>Very recently, a very complicated case involving the police was brought to a conclusion within one year, because all those involved put their minds to getting the thing done quickly.

<a name="91021-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09102132000074"></a>There is an example of this in the case of the Armed Forces. Since 5 June 2006, there have been regular Written Ministerial Statements with information about inquests into the deaths of military personnel. I welcome the amendments and commend them to the Government, but I particularly welcome Amendment 47&#151;with its suggestion that the Lord Chancellor should make six-monthly reviews to Parliament&#151;because Parliament could then be aware of delays, particularly in outstandingly long cases, and perhaps imposing ministerial scrutiny on the system could help to speed it up and reduce delay, which is one of the reasons for this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09102132000076"></a>It seems quite a long time since the beginning of June when we were in Committee on the Bill. The Minister might remember that my late friend Lord Kingsland dealt with this matter at that stage, when the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, talked about the need for timely inquests. The Minister will accept that there is agreement right around the House about the need for timely inquests; we all think it desirable.</p>

<a name="91021-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09102132000077"></a>We support these amendments, moved this time by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in that they would make no extra demands on the resources of coroners but would help them, and indeed everyone else, to get a clearer idea of where and why blockages are arising in the system. It is in the interests of everyone that we have such expeditious inquests, not least for bereaved families. I particularly remember the somewhat voguish word used by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, when he talked about the need for &#147;closure&#148; in these matters. He was right to use it, and it is something that we should all pursue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09102132000078"></a>Amendment 47 is the second arm of these two amendments, and would put the onus on the Lord Chancellor to report to Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked about the importance of that for extra ministerial scrutiny of these matters. We welcome it because it is also important for the extra parliamentary scrutiny that would be allowed if Ministers themselves had to see why there were unnecessary delays and had to iron out the problems. Although we accept that the amendments will not solve all the problems of delay, they would do an awful lot to help to rectify those problems, and we support them. We are hoping for honeyed words from the Minister as he welcomes them, or at least explains why the Government will do something else that will make them unnecessary.</p>

I am quite concerned about this very long delay for armed services coroners&#146; reports. In my view, it is, for a member of the Armed Forces, deplorable that the family, a widow or a mother, should be kept waiting for two to three years for the final report. I also am perturbed because should, God forbid, the casualty rate increase out of Afghanistan and anywhere else the Armed Forces serve, I see an even further delay. In the second paragraph of the amendment, the noble Baroness proposes that the coroner keeps a registration. I would like to see the Chief Coroner have a plan and do something about quickening the process.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09102132000081"></a>The Minister knows my concern about this from the previous post he held. I do not see much improvement in the system overall. Either we want more coroners or we want a better system. With great respect, I would remind noble Lords that I cannot recall a coroner&#146;s report on each and every one of the 30,000 dead from the German bombings of this country during the war, or on airmen who were shot down on our land, or on those of us who fought abroad and certainly not on those in the Merchant Navy who were killed or sunk in our own waters by enemy submarines. The whole question of the Armed Forces and how they are dealt with in this matter wants a thorough examination.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09102132000082"></a>I would ask the Chief Coroner and the Minister to see what can be done to hasten that process. The length of time a family waits for this report is cruel and deplorable.</p>

I fully acknowledge that the delay involved in some investigations is unacceptable and we have already included provisions in this Bill to assist with those situations. It is inappropriate to make a Second Reading-type speech at this late stage, but the whole essence of this Bill is to make the coroners&#146; system more effective and more efficient so that these times can be reduced. Our objectives and the objectives of everyone who has spoken are congruent.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09102132000084"></a>The introduction of a Chief Coroner will provide operational leadership for the first time and the introduction of the new medical examiner service will mean that fewer deaths are reported to coroners in the first place. Nevertheless, as noble Lords have pointed out, we already know that certain types of investigations are far more likely to lead to delays. In general, these will be where coroners depend on other organisations to provide investigation reports&#151;not just the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, but organisations such as the Health and Safety Executive or a transport accident investigation branch&#151;or when there is a requirement to investigate a death abroad, particularly a death in a country which does not understand the role of British coroners. However, as my noble friend mentioned in Committee, the vast majority of inquests, some 64 per cent of the total, are completed within six months and 91 per cent are completed within 12 months.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09102132000085"></a>I support the policy objectives that the amendments are aiming to achieve, but I hope I can convince the House that there are better ways in which they may be  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_713"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 713</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>delivered. We intend to make regulations under Clause 38(3)(e) that will require information to be provided by senior coroners to the Chief Coroner, which will include information on inquests that have been delayed, to enable the Chief Coroner to have operational oversight of the service. The Chief Coroner is likely to take a particular interest in the details of coroners&#146; oldest cases, or those where the indications are that the investigation has stalled. This will enable the Chief Coroner to assist in any liaison which may be necessary with other organisations investigating the circumstances of the death, or to improve the protocols which are, or will be, established between coroners and particular organisations.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09102132000086"></a>In relation to overseas deaths, the Chief Coroner, with the help of our consulate service overseas, will play an important role in representing the interests of the coronial system and will help to secure information on behalf of particular coroners. The Chief Coroner will therefore monitor the oldest or lengthier cases, and is likely to publish information about them for inclusion in his or her annual report. I therefore believe that these amendments are unnecessary, and suggest that the regulations&#151;on which we will be consulting fully at a later stage&#151;would be a more fitting place for them.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09102132000087"></a>Similarly, as the annual report would be laid before each House of Parliament, we do not believe it to be necessary for the Lord Chancellor to make half-yearly statements to the House. The Chief Coroner&#146;s report will be laid before each House of Parliament and should be self-explanatory. Of course, the Lord Chancellor may be questioned on any aspect of the contents of this report and how he or she intends to react to any issues raised through the normal procedures, such as Oral and Written Parliamentary Questions.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09102132000088"></a>The Chief Coroner will be involved in drafting the regulations, which will be properly consulted on so that they are fit for purpose. A particular question is what will happen to the present system of quarterly Written Ministerial Statements on military inquests. In the short to medium term&#151;two to three years&#151;we anticipate that those statements will continue. However, once the new system is implemented, particularly with the appointment of the Chief Coroner, we may review that. Decisions are likely to be dependent on a number of factors. The first and most obvious is that the situation in theatre may be quite different in two to three years. Secondly, it may be more appropriate for the Chief Coroner, as operational head of service, to recommend to the Lord Chancellor the best and most appropriate method of collating and disseminating this information. Thirdly, some of these deaths may in future be dealt with by way of fatal accident inquiry in Scotland rather than by way of inquest in England and Wales, so that would also need to be considered when publicising this information.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09102132000089"></a>There is always a conflict between putting something on the face of the Bill and including it in regulations, but we recommend the latter because the regulations would be better as a result. Our objectives coincide with everyone who has spoken&#151;to improve the efficiency of the coroner service and as part of that, reduce the time that people have to wait. On that basis, and

In Committee, the Government resisted our amendment. If we are convinced that the concern has been sufficiently addressed through other means then we will not necessarily insist that this wording be included in the Bill. However, we need to hear what the Government will do to ensure protection for coroner A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09102132000098"></a>That seems to be a matter of common sense.

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the Chief Coroner to direct that an investigation be transferred from one coroner, coroner B, to a coroner in a different area, coroner A, and the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would mean that the Chief Coroner would have to consider the ability of coroner A&#146;s relevant authority to resource the investigation before doing so. As the noble Lord said, the late and very much missed Lord Kingsland tabled this amendment in Committee and indicated that he would retable it on Report.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09102132000100"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham explained that the general principle when the Chief Coroner transfers a case under Clause 3 would be for coroner B&#146;s area to retain responsibility for funding even after the investigation transfers to coroner A. My noble friend said then that there would be some exceptions to this and that regulations would set out in more detail where the responsibility for funding would rest following such a transfer. We have given the issue further thought over the summer, and I shall outline&#151;shortly, but in a little more detail&#151;how we envisage these regulations working. Of course this will be subject to change as we will consult on the regulations once the Bill has received Royal Assent. However, I hope the  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_718"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 718</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>detail will allay the concerns of the noble Lord and the House about this small but significant aspect of the Bill, which will benefit bereaved families and ensure that the system operates with more of a national dimension than is possible at the moment.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09102132000101"></a>In summary, we think that there are three possible funding arrangements&#151;the first will be the general rule, and the other two arrangements will be exceptions to this general rule. These will be set out in regulations made under paragraph 9 of Schedule 7. The general rule will apply to most transferred cases. Regulations will say that when an investigation is transferred, coroner B&#146;s relevant authority will be required to meet the expenses of coroner A. This will apply, for example, where the Chief Coroner transfers a case to coroner A to reduce a severe backlog in coroner B&#146;s area, or where a bereaved family lives far from where their loved one died and the Chief Coroner directs a coroner who is more local to the family to carry out that investigation. I hope that reassures the House that in the vast majority of cases there will be no extra resource burden on coroner A, who will be hearing the case.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09102132000102"></a>The regulations will also set out two exceptions to the general funding principle. The first is where the relevant authority for coroner A will be responsible for meeting the expenses of the investigation. When a death occurs overseas and the body is brought back to England and Wales, the coroner for that area&#151;coroner B&#151;initially has a duty to carry out the investigation. However, the investigation may transfer to a different coroner who is nearer the family, coroner A, whose relevant authority will then fund it.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09102132000103"></a>The second exception is where relevant authorities for coroners A and B agree to share expenses. We think that this is likely to happen in only a few cases. An example might be where two or more people are ultimately killed in one incident, such as a car accident. If, while still alive, one person was moved to another coroner area where they later die, the legislation would require investigations to happen in the two areas where the bodies are lying. However, the Chief Coroner may decide that both deaths should be investigated jointly by the coroner in whose area the incident occurred. Funding arrangements could then be agreed between the relevant authorities.</p>

<a name="91021-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09102132000104"></a>I shall briefly outline&#151;helpfully, I hope&#151;other related matters that we envisage regulations covering. These could include procedures for notifying interested persons of a transfer, and a provision for coroner A to be accountable to coroner B&#146;s relevant authority for expenses incurred in a case transferred to them, as they would normally be accountable to their own authority. We will of course work with local authorities, the Local Government Association and the Coroners&#146; Society, among others, to develop these regulations. I hope that, in the light of what I have said, the noble Lord might be content that the regulations will sufficiently address the concerns he has rightly raised about resourcing transferred cases, and that he might withdraw his amendment.</p>

During earlier stages of the Bill it was repeatedly drawn to noble Lords&#146; attention&#151;particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and by others&#151;that the genesis of at least some of the momentum behind this Bill was the events of the Shipman inquiry, subsequent to the horrible and terrible events that had occurred. One important failure of the coronial service at that time was to see each death that came to its attention solely as an individual item. It did not pay proper attention to the fact that a whole series of deaths were occurring that formed a pattern which could quite clearly have pointed to what happened. Afterwards there was a great focus on the negligent medical contribution, and properly so, but remarkably little focus in the public mind on the failures of the coronial service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09102132000109"></a>One problem with Clause 5 is that it draws the scope of inquests quite narrowly in Clause 5(1), to look only at the individual, and only widens it in Clause 5(2) in order to address deaths that raise implications regarding the European Convention on Human Rights. The amendment seeks to make clear to the senior coroner involved that, if there are reasonable grounds&#151;for example, the death of a vulnerable elderly person in a private nursing home, a death in a private workplace, or concerns about transport and workplace

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09102132000110"></a>This issue was raised before by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and has also been pressed by the JCHR. I know that at that stage the Minister made clear that the coroner had the discretion to deal with matters in the way that I have described. However, it is not in the Bill. If part of the whole purpose of this legislation is not only to change the legal structure but to send a message to the community at large and to the officials involved as to what the community expects should be done, it seems that there is no case for not putting it clearly in the Bill. In this amendment we make it clear that if the senior coroner is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for determining that the continued or repeated occurrence of the circumstances led to the death, and that these are in the public interest, he should proceed. We heard what the Minister said before, but it does not, without this amendment, send the kind of message that would be extremely helpful, particularly in light of the events that led to the current legislation. Therefore, I beg to move.</p>

The new requirements do not seem unreasonable. After all, if there is a continued risk to the public, something ought to be done about it, the &#147;somebody&#148; in this case being the senior coroner. However, I wonder whether the amendment will expand Clause 5 to a broader remit than is intended by the spirit of the Bill. This is why I say that I have only some sympathy to offer the noble Lord. Clause 5 is deliberately&#151;as I understand it&#151;narrow so that matters to be ascertained are the circumstances surrounding the death of the individual who is the subject of the inquest. I fully accept that the Minister will explain at greater length why he will resist the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, but I ask simply to add to the debate the question of whether the amendment would increase a degree of inconsistency in inquests if senior coroners made different decisions on which matters ought to be ascertained. That may cloud the purpose of Clause 5, which we believe is currently a straightforward direction of matters to be ascertained. For those reasons, as I said, it is only a degree of sympathy that I can offer to the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice.</p>

Although Clause 5(2) specifies that deaths engaging Article 2&#151;where the state is implicated in the death&#151;should have a wider investigation, this does not mean that the coroner cannot have such an investigation in other cases if he or she takes the view that circumstances demand it. In addition, it is likely that the Chief Coroner would issue guidance on cases where a broader investigation would be appropriate. This might include those situations specified in the amendment; for example, a death which raises wider and significant issues of public health and safety, such as when he or she is

The deaths in Stafford hospital would be a good example of that.</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09102132000113"></a>The key issue here is that the coroner will have the discretion to require a wider investigation if he thinks fit. He will continue to have the discretion to set the scope of any inquest and may decide to investigate the broad circumstances. We do not think that it is in the interests of the vast majority of families for coroners&#146; investigations to be extended. Many already find inquests intimidating and to have the scope expanded would mean that it would no longer be a relatively straightforward inquisition. There are also, of course, resource implications. The wider the scope and the longer the inquest takes, the more coroners would be needed. It is also argued that more legal representation would be required to ensure that family interests are better represented, thus removing families from the heart of the process.</p>

However, it is not simply a matter of saying that only the family should be involved at the heart of the inquest. The whole point is that it does not involve just the family of the person who has gone; other families might find themselves in similar circumstances if the matters are not resolved and clarified. That is also an important heart of any inquest.</p>

I rather doubt that coroners in general will read the Bill, and particularly the debate in your Lordships' House, in detail. My only hope is that a Chief Coroner will be appointed who will not only read the Bill but the debate and the injunction of the Minister that he should put in place guidance for others which would include this specific issue.

Of course, it should make it a service for the 21st century, so it should not duck a central fact of 21st century security and policing; namely, that intercept evidence plays an increasing part in much of that policing and security work. The coronial service must be enabled to work with that, which is the aim of my amendments.</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09102132000118"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, said that I was barging in in a cavalier fashion in trying to introduce intercept in coroners&#146; courts. She will be happy to hear that I have met the intercept as evidence implementation unit about which she talked. I appreciate that its work is necessary and complex. However, does this House have the will to put at the heart of the Bill a single coronial system that operates when somebody dies, or will it accept the parallel system which the Government prefer because they cannot bring themselves to accept an adapted form of intercept that would work within the coronial system?</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09102132000119"></a>The House will recall that this problem was highlighted by the Azelle Rodney inquest, but the increasing use of intercept means that this is a growing problem. The Rodney inquest has been outstanding for four years and we have already talked this afternoon of the effects of this delay, not only on family but also on witnesses. Four years is a long time for a witness to remember any facts accurately and it must seem like a lifetime in hell for the mother whose child has been killed. This inquest cannot be heard, we are told, because of the intercept evidence and/or the method of gathering it. The revelation of this evidence would jeopardise national security or the ability to detect and investigate further crime activity.</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09102132000120"></a>We certainly accept on these Benches that there will be occasions when evidence cannot be openly heard and this is not a new problem. In Committee we were reminded that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, first proposed lifting the ban on this evidence 10 years ago. The Chilcot review recommended lifting the absolute ban on Section 17 of RIPA in February 2008. We tried in this House to address these problems in legislation in the Counter-Terrorism Bill in 2008 when the Government proposed secret inquests. In fact, in the face of united opposition, they withdrew that proposition, very sensibly. Today they propose a solution using the Inquiries Act to solve this problem, which we believe is an even worse solution than their previous unacceptable idea of secret juryless inquests. Under the Inquiries Act they will have far too wide-ranging powers to restrict public access to hearings and documents which will restrict the final report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09102132000121"></a>I do not believe that the Government paid sufficient attention to what the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones&#151;then shadow Minister for Security and now shadow Home Office Minister&#151;said from Conservative Front Bench when she explained why she supported the amendments we tabled then, which were similar to those before your Lordships&#146; House today.

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09102132000122"></a>These amendments have been carefully drafted to ensure that all evidence, including that gathered under RIPA, can be heard by a judge sitting as a coroner. He is independent from Government and seen to be so. He has the power to address the fact that some of the evidence may need to be heard in private and may never see the light of day. But importantly, the whole process remains within the coronial system with all its independence from the state. This point was eloquently explained in Committee by the late Lord Kingsland in his usual forensic and concise manner when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09102132000257"></a>&#147;The Opposition would much prefer a solution in the coronial context to the one in the context of the Inquiries Act&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/09; col. 725.]</p>

<p><a name="09102132000235"></a>He also pointed to a good compromise in an attempt to meet the Government&#146;s concerns when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09102132000258"></a>&#147;There may be room for an amendment that advances the possibility that, in certain circumstances, intercept evidence could be used in a traditional coronial context, with appropriate safeguards. However, if it is considered that the security nature of that evidence is such that relevant matters should be withheld from the jury, the Government could go to the second stage and initiate an inquiry&#151;as long as the amendments that we tabled to the inquiry system were accepted by the Government&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/09; col. 727-28.]</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09102132000123"></a>Government Amendments 21 to 23 miss the central point that Lord Kingsland made so concisely. They also miss the point made in Committee so cogently by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, that there are powerful safeguards already in our amendments but that if the Government feel that additional safeguards are needed, they should explain what they are and table those. The Government have ignored the constructive suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and instead simply invite us to accept the unacceptable.</p>

<a name="91021-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09102132000124"></a>We believe that our coronial system ensures that the coroner sets the remit for an investigation into a death, and not the state. Our coronial system is there to ensure that citizens as jurors are involved in violent or unnatural deaths at the hands of the state. The fact is, they are there as the eyes and ears of society to make sure that the state has not overstepped the line. Ensuring our security may sometimes involve police shooting to kill, for example. We would all accept that there is a fine line between ensuring our security in such a way and impunity for agents of the state when things have gone wrong. It is not for the Government to have any part in deciding where that line is or, indeed, when it has been overstepped. Our amendments would ensure that the coroners system remains at the heart of the most difficult and controversial deaths. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09102132000126"></a>I am puzzled because the committee of distinguished privy counsellors, chaired by Sir John Chilcot and comprising my noble and learned friend Lord Archer, Sir Alan Beith MP, the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, who has now been replaced by the right honourable Michael Howard, reported to the Government in January 2008 after six months of detailed investigation, taking written and oral evidence from an impressive array of those who know about interception, including Members of your Lordships&#146; House, that nine conditions would have to be met&#151;the noble Baroness did not mention this&#151;before intercept could be used as evidence in court. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister made clear in the House of Commons in February 2008, the Government accepted the report in its entirety, including its conclusion&#151;again, the noble Baroness did not mention this&#151;that, if the nine conditions were not met, intercept as evidence should not be introduced in courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09102132000127"></a>The Home Office intercept as evidence implementation unit was set up and I am pleased to hear that the noble Baroness has visited it and got to know what its work is about. However, as she no doubt discovered, it has not yet completed its detailed work. Anyone who knows anything about interception in all its complexity of operational and other problems is not surprised that such a task is taking this kind of time. Anyone who thinks otherwise fails to appreciate the importance and the enormity of the problems. No one whom I know has ever been against using intercept as evidence as a matter of principle. The practical problems and dangers in its implementation are and have always been the difficulty. When this issue has come up in another place, both the right honourable Alan Beith and the right honourable Michael Howard have made it clear that they, too, think that the Chilcot conditions must be met before there can be a change in this.</p>

As I said in June, I find myself wholly in agreement with the final sentence of a letter from Mobile Broadband Group, which represents the UK businesses of O2, Orange, T-Mobile, Virgin Mobile,  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_725"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 725</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Vodafone and 3. The mobile operators form a significant constituent part of the communications services providers, whose importance is frequently recognised in the reports of interception commissioners. The last sentence of the letter states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09102132000259"></a>&#147;If intercept as evidence is to be introduced into any court (criminal, civil or coroners) it should be done in a comprehensive way, meeting the nine conditions of the Privy Council review in their totality, including a detailed implementation plan which incorporates safeguarding the critical interests of partners&#146; legitimate needs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102132000236"></a>I could not put it better myself. I oppose the amendment.</p>

However, I suggest to the House that the answer to the points is that Section 18 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act already allows for the use of intercept material in courts in a number of exceptional circumstances. All that the amendment proposes is that there should be a further exception allowed by reason of the exceptional circumstances of the cases that we are talking about, and the desperate need for the coronial jurisdiction to function effectively. It may be that further conditions should be added to the provision suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller; but if further protective provisions are needed, the Government should come forward and explain what protection is further required in order that this intercept evidence may be used in the coronial jurisdiction.</p>

There is all the difference in the world between now adding the provision to allow a coroners&#146; court to hear intercept evidence, and the careful, detailed and complicated negotiations and consideration that took place in preparing the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000&#151;I do not know if the noble Lord was involved in that. The Chilcot committee report says that intercept could be used in court under nine conditions. To circumvent that by coming in sideways and saying, &#147;Well, it could come into a coroners&#146; court because we think that is a good idea&#148; is quite unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09102132000135"></a>I worry about this debate, because it seems to be a continuation, relentlessly pursued in the hope that one day, accidentally, the measure will pass. At the Prime Minister&#146;s instigation, the House&#151;and Parliament generally&#151;set up a committee of privy counsellors to look into this fraught business. The Prime Minister made it clear at the time that, in principle, he was in favour of intercept as evidence. However, he said that he had had strong representations, especially from the intelligence services, indicating that there were serious reservations about the use of intercept that might affect national security.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_726"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 726</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09102132000136"></a>At that point, the Prime Minister said, &#147;Right, we will set up a committee of distinguished privy counsellors&#148;, and the members of that committee were by any standards distinguished. They looked at the matter, pored over it and came to a conclusion. They said that, again, in principle, intercept as evidence should be used in court, but they said that there had to be nine conditions in order to protect what they defined as protectors of national security. I thought that we had arrived, exhaustingly over a period, at a consensus that we should let the process proceed to see whether the nine conditions could be satisfied. The Home Office has set up a department, and the noble Baroness has been to see it, as have I, to give an opinion on that, but as yet a conclusion has not been reached and the Chilcot committee members have not yet come back to us on whether the nine conditions can be satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09102132000137"></a>I think it would be entirely wrong if today the House were to make a decision that pre-empted the careful, detailed and sensitive consideration that is going on inside the machinery of government. It is all very well saying that a bit of tweaking here and a bit of tweaking there will satisfy one particular case, because it appears that this campaign revolves around one case, but we all know that one case does not necessarily justify a wholesale change in legislation, especially when a committee of privy counsellors has concluded that conditions must be established. The committee of privy counsellors was not alone. The interception commissioner, who was established precisely to look after the interests of the country, has clearly and emphatically stated that there should be no change in the current situation unless and until the nine conditions are satisfied.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09102132000138"></a>Therefore, I hope that the noble Baroness will reflect on this debate and other debates and withdraw her amendment. Perhaps she will consult her party colleague, Sir Alan Beith, withdraw the amendment and allow the process, taking into account the Chilcot recommendations, to go ahead and not press it to a vote in this House today.</p>

We are, by the very nature of our work, permitted to see intercept in connection with these inquiries. I have come to the conclusion, as have other members of the committee&#151;Sir Alan Beith served with great distinction on it for a long time&#151;that it would jeopardise very sensitive intelligence sources if we passed this amendment today.

When he intervened, it made me think even more about my concern that this is the thin end of the wedge. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is moving this amendment now and I have no doubt that next year she will push further forward, but I repeat that I think it would jeopardise our intelligence sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09102132000141"></a>Strangely, noble Lords have heard almost in succession three Scots voices. We Scots are very cautious about taking this kind of dramatic step. Ironically&#151;I hope that the Minister&#146;s reply will confirm my understanding&#151;these amendments would apply only to England and Wales. Therefore, they would not apply in Scotland, which raises an interesting and difficult anomaly.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09102132000142"></a>As my noble friends have said, Chilcot, with representatives from all parties, was very cautious about the recommendation. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said that it recommended that intercept should be used as evidence. It did not. It put huge qualifications on it&#151;nine, as my noble friend Lady Ramsay said&#151;and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, did not even refer to them. She brushed them aside as if they were of no consequence, yet they are absolutely vital and crucial. If they are able to be satisfied, the intelligence services would go along with it but, until then, it is quite irresponsible to press ahead with this amendment.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09102132000143"></a>I do not say this in relation to anyone present, of course, but when someone is a government Minister they realise the importance of these kinds of safeguards but, once they are free of the office, they somehow take a different view. We need to recognise that Ministers and heads of the intelligence services have day-to-day responsibility and we should be very careful about ignoring their advice.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09102132000144"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, asked a very relevant question about when the implementation group would report. No doubt the Minister may be able to deal with that in his reply. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and others would agree that we should not prejudge and pre-empt the work of that implementation group. If we were to pass this amendment today, we would be doing just that, and I think it would be a very unwise course of action.</p>

We have debated this matter on many occasions; as the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, made clear and as the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said, the same participants have appeared again and again. I am new to this debate as I am taking over from my late friend Lord Kingsland. I hope that I shall take much the same line.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09102132000146"></a>This issue has caused considerable unease in the House and elsewhere. As the Minister will be the first to admit when he comes to reply, the Government have clearly recognised that unease and have drawn back from some of their earlier and, dare I say, more offensive proposals. If the noble Lord remembers, the original Clauses 11 and 12, which swallowed up a great deal of time in another place, were then dropped without so much as a squeak by the Government when they realised that they would not be able to push them through your Lordships&#146; House. In a Written Statement which the noble Lord will remember, which was slipped out by the Lord Chancellor, we learnt that in difficult cases the Government would instead make use of the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09102132000147"></a>In Committee, my late friend made it clear that he was still uneasy with those proposals and suggested the minimum changes that would need to be made to  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 2005 Act for the Government&#146;s proposals to be in any way acceptable. The first of those requirements was that, where an inquiry is to be used as an inquest, it will always be chaired either by a High Court judge or by a more senior judge. My late noble friend also considered that it would be an outrage if the Secretary of State attempted, in the course of an inquiry looking into the death of someone under Clause 5, to seek to change the terms of reference of that inquiry. In their Amendments 21 and following, the Government have sought to address those concerns. For that, at least, we are grateful and we are happy to accept the concessions which the Government have made, so far as they go, to make the use of the Inquiries Act more palatable. However, we do not believe that they have addressed the underlying problem which is the use of the coroner's court as the first choice to hear an inquest, not an inquiry established by the Executive.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09102132000148"></a>As a matter of principle, the Opposition would much prefer a solution based in the coronial context than one based in the context of the Inquiries Act. The Government want to use the Inquiries Act to fulfil the obligation to have a process to examine deaths at the hands of the state that cannot currently be dealt with by an inquest because of their refusal to budge on allowing certain types of information to be heard at an inquest. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, explained, the information and the methods by which it was collected fall under RIPA. We are very sympathetic to the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments that allow RIPA material to be part of an inquest and create special provisions to protect the national interest in matters of true national security.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09102132000260"></a>&#147;There is widespread support for this measure across your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. It will address an anomaly in RIPA and ensure that all inquests comply with Article 2 of the ECHR. The point is not simply that inquests should be institutionally independent, but that they should be prompt. Part of the problem here is that we are delaying justice in several cases, which is not good for the reputation of British justice&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/11/08; col. 1298.].</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09102132000150"></a>The Government have cast about for different solutions to the problem. They have moved by degrees, but have yet to come up with anything that commands widespread support throughout the House or elsewhere. We all know that groups such as INQUEST, Liberty and JUSTICE have thrown their weight behind the case for allowing intercept evidence to be heard in inquests. We do not wish to delay justice any longer. I do not know what the noble Baroness intends to do with her amendment or how the Government intend to respond to it. We will listen carefully to the Government and to the noble Baroness&#146;s response, and if she is minded to test the opinion of the House, it is possible, depending on what the Government have to say, that we will support her.</p>

We all have sympathy with that and would like to see it resolved in an appropriate way. Then there is a separate strand, a continuing campaign by a number of noble Lords and many people outside this House who believe that if intercept evidence could be introduced into the court system, it would provide a magic bullet that would resolve all sorts of other issues. We would not need quite such complicated and draconian terrorism legislation, we could resolve all sorts of serious crime issues and so on and so forth, and it would be absolutely wonderful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09102132000152"></a>The reality is that it would be much more complicated and difficult than that. That is why the Chilcot committee was set up to look at the practical issues involved. Its conclusion was to highlight a series of things that have to be done before, with safety, we could allow this principle to go forward. The Chilcot committee is still working on whether there are things that could be done to safeguard security and the ways in which things are obtained and to avoid a situation in which so much material is generated in evidential quantities that in practice less intelligence would be gathered on serious crime and terrorists. It would be premature for any change to be made that pre-empts that work. The seriousness of this issue is why the Chilcot committee was set up. It would be wholly unfortunate to pre-empt what it is doing, as with all due respect both strands of the argument in favour of this amendment are doing. Yes, we have to find a way of resolving these appalling delays for individual families who would like a resolution of the matters that concern them, but that must be separate. We must avoid prejudicing a much wider and important issue of public policy.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09102132000261"></a>&#147;I am uneasy about using the Inquiries Act for this purpose because its procedures are initiated by an executive act by the Secretary of State, and the investigation flows from that act&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/6/09; col. 624.]</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09102132000157"></a>To address those concerns, noble Lords opposite proposed amendments to the Inquiries Act, which among other things sought to ensure that an inquiry established to investigate the circumstances of a person&#146;s death was chaired by a senior judge and to restrict the Secretary of State&#146;s power to vary the terms of reference of such an inquiry.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09102132000158"></a>We thought very carefully about the points made by both the late Lord Kingsland and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, in that debate, and the government amendments that I intend to move later today will, I trust, provide some reassurance. As I indicated in Committee, it was always our expectation that any inquiry established to investigate a person&#146;s death would be chaired by a senior judge, in much the same way that what was Clause 11 provided for a High Court judge to preside at a certified inquest. Moreover, we also expect the terms of reference for any such inquiry to include, as a minimum, the matters to be ascertained by a coroner, as set out in Clause 5.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09102132000159"></a>These government amendments will give statutory force to our stated intentions. Under the amendments, the duty on a coroner to suspend an investigation pending the outcome of an inquiry would bite only where the inquiry was chaired by a High Court judge or a more senior judge. Moreover, where a coroner has suspended the investigation, the terms of reference of the inquiry must include, as an irreducible minimum, the matters to be ascertained, as set out in Clause 5. I hope that the amendments will reassure the House on that point.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09102132000160"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, come at the same fundamental issue from a different angle. They offer two alternative solutions, and I will address each of them in turn. Her Amendments 4, 5 and 122 put forward an alternative solution to holding an inquiry under the Inquiries Act in cases in which there is intercept evidence of central relevance to the circumstances of a death. These amendments seek to provide for the admissibility of intercept evidence in inquests by making amendments to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. As we have been told, we have debated this issue on a number of occasions, both in the context of this Bill and when considering the Counter-Terrorism Bill during the last Session.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09102132000161"></a>These amendments replicate those tabled in Committee, and the arguments we have heard&#151;there is no harm in that at all&#151;are clearly well rehearsed and familiar to us. It is clear that there is a shared appreciation all around the House that a very real problem exists and that we need to find a solution to that problem. But it is also clear that we have yet to find a consensus.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09102132000162"></a>Our position, as the Government, on the use of intercept evidence in inquests has not changed. Allowing the use of sensitive intercept material as evidence at inquests allows a potentially very wide disclosure of this material, not just to a High Court judge who may be sitting as a coroner but to the jurors, the bereaved families, other interested parties and to the public at large. Even if the public were excluded, this would still be problematic.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09102132000163"></a>We are not persuaded that such widespread disclosure of intercepted material, even if it was confined in the way suggested, is worth the real risk to national security  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_731"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 731</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the fight against serious and organised crime which would ensue. Simply put, it could undermine the vital need to protect such sensitive material, the sources of that material, the capabilities available and the techniques used to obtain that material. On behalf of the Government, I must emphasise that the potential effects of disclosing any of those things cannot be underestimated and are, in our opinion, too high a price to pay.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09102132000164"></a>I have previously acknowledged, and I accept, that it is not necessarily the intention of these amendments for all intercept material to be fully disclosed. However, in those very few cases where this is an issue it will be impossible to redact intercept material in such a way as to disguise the method or means by which it was obtained. Disclosure of intercept capabilities would clearly have a very real and damaging effect on our ability to gather intelligence that is vital to national security and the fight against serious organised crime.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09102132000165"></a>Many distinguished speakers in this debate have referred to the Chilcot review, which, on intercept as evidence, has recognised the dangers of disclosing such material. That is why the Government are taking forward a detailed programme of work to ensure that we can meet the tests set out in that review and allow intercept to be used safely in the criminal courts without putting national security at risk. As I understand it&#151;this came up in the debate&#151;the intention is to provide Parliament with a final report from the Chilcot review in the next few weeks.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09102132000166"></a>The protections offered in these amendments, which include only the possibility of redactions to material relating to the method or means by which the information was obtained, are, in our opinion, wholly inadequate to protect the public interest. Moreover, if we were able to identify a way to use intercept evidence safely in criminal trials, there is not an automatic read-across to inquests. I say that because, in a criminal trial the prosecution has the option of discontinuing the prosecution if there is a risk of disclosure of sensitive material or capabilities. That option does not exist in the same way in an inquest which has to be held. We argue that these amendments create the potential for public disclosure of all types of intercept material, including the sensitive techniques, capabilities and sources by which it was obtained, thereby undermining the very real need to protect this material in the public interest.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09102132000167"></a>At present&#151;and this will continue&#151;in the reformed system, coroners and other interested parties are provided, wherever possible, with the gist or a summary of any relevant sensitive material at the outset of the investigation. This material can also be shared with the jury. The amendment does not resolve the problem for those very rare cases where intercept material is absolutely central to the investigation, but which it is impossible to gist or redact in such as way as to disguise the method or means by which it was obtained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09102132000168"></a>Of course, we recognise the importance of ensuring that bereaved relatives and other properly interested persons should be involved in the conduct of an inquest as far as possible. Ensuring greater participation in the coronial process for the families of bereaved persons is at the heart of these reforms. Proposals  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_732"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 732</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as our plans for a new appeals process have been widely welcomed, as have the services outlined in the charter for bereaved people, and other measures we have taken to improve the standing of families. But we have to strike a balance between the interests of the families, in one or two exceptional cases, and the wider public interest when there is sensitive material that is central to the inquest. The amendments do not achieve that balance.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09102132000169"></a>By way of contrast, the holding of an inquiry would permit, in exceptional circumstances, the disclosure of intercept material to the chairman of an inquiry established to examine the circumstances of a person&#146;s death in accordance with the existing provisions in Section 18 of RIPA. It would also permit disclosure to any inquiry panel members and to the counsel to the inquiry, but it would not permit further disclosure. It would permit the participation of families through counsel to the inquiry to the extent necessary to safeguard their interests. As a result, it would be possible to achieve our twin objectives of an Article 2-compliant investigation while safeguarding sensitive intercept material and preserving what has been described as the ring of secrecy.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09102132000170"></a>Briefings previously provided on this issue by the notable organisations INQUEST, Liberty and JUSTICE have recognised the difficulties that we face, stating that under these amendments,</p>
<ul><a name="09102132000277"></a>&#147;it will remain possible for a judge conducting an investigation to ban or restrict the jury&#146;s or public&#146;s access to material that would be contrary to the interests of national security&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102132000237"></a>I welcome the recognition that we need to protect intercept material. However, the solution put forward here is flawed, since it does not resolve the central matter of how to proceed when the investigations must, as a matter of law, be held with a jury, but there is sensitive material which may be central to the inquest and which should not be made public&#151;even to the jury&#151;in the interests of national security.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09102132000171"></a>If it is accepted that there will be circumstances where intercept evidence cannot be disclosed to a coroner&#146;s jury, it necessarily follows that, in such cases, the jury cannot be the finder of facts as it would be inappropriate and wrong for the jury to give a determination that is not based on all the relevant evidence. I suggest to the House that the logical consequence is that the jury would have to be dispensed with in such cases in any event.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09102132000172"></a>Having thought about this matter at great length, the only viable way to conduct a full, thorough and Article 2-compliant investigation into deaths where sensitive intercept evidence cannot be made available to the inquest, is not by a blanket lifting of the bar on the admissibility of intercept evidence at inquests, which would put capabilities at risk, but by establishing an inquiry. Therefore, when the time comes, I ask the House to reject the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09102132000173"></a>I pray in aid that we have heard speeches in this debate from those who have great knowledge in various and different ways about how significant and serious this matter is&#151;what the real effect might be should intercept evidence be allowed into our hearings too easily. I respectfully say to the noble Lord, in a friendly

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09102132000174"></a>Like the Government&#146;s amendments, Amendments 20, 24, 25 and 26 touch on the relationship between a coroner&#146;s investigation and an inquiry into the same death. It remains the view of the Government that it is entirely appropriate that, where an inquiry is established into the circumstances of a death, the coroner&#146;s investigation should be suspended and resumed only if the coroner considers that there are exceptional reasons to do so. To do otherwise would be illogical and a waste of resources. To have two separate investigations into the same death going on at the same time under different regimes would lead to confusion and inconsistency, as well as possibly causing added intrusion into the private grief of the family for no obvious benefit.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09102132000175"></a>The Bill provides that an investigation may not be resumed after the completion of an inquiry unless&#151;but must be resumed if&#151;the senior coroner believes that there is sufficient reason for resuming it. We believe that these provisions are sufficient, as they are intended to cover situations where the terms of reference of an inquiry will not, or have not, achieved an inquest&#146;s statutory purposes.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09102132000176"></a>Indeed, if the circumstances of the death had been fully investigated by an inquiry, I would have to question the value of resuming the inquest in such an event, particularly if the coroner would not have access to sensitive material, such as intercept evidence, which had been available to the inquiry. I would have thought that the concerns expressed around the House about delays in complex cases, if not in inquests generally, would be sufficient reason for not having two similar types of inquiry into the same case.</p>

<a name="91021-0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09102132000177"></a>I have spoken long enough in answering this debate. I would ask the House to support the government amendments when they are moved in due course and, for the reasons that I have tried to outline, to oppose the other amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>

I think that we all share certain concerns, one of which is for the security of this country&#151;I do not think that that is in question. However, what is in question is the way of arriving at a solution that not only provides for modernisation of the coroners system&#151;and which, as I mentioned, recognises that the use of intercept will necessarily become an ever greater part of the evidence that is produced&#151;but has at its very heart an independent coroners and inquest service, and not a parallel system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09102132000179"></a>I listened to the very informed comments from the government Back Benches. Noble Lords spoke about the Chilcot inquiry. That was an extremely important inquiry whose findings I would not belittle in any way. Nevertheless, it must be possible for the Government and all their advisers to work out a way to put those nine conditions into the Bill in such a way&#151;it may not be possible next month, but we have been waiting for two years already&#151;that they can stay within the inquest system and the conditions can be fulfilled. That has

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09102132000180"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, said that this is about having sympathy with the families. All of us of course have sympathy with the families, but today&#146;s debate has not been about that; it is about the principle of what should be at the heart of the inquest system in those most difficult cases where it is the state which, for whatever reason, has been the cause of the death of the person for whom the inquest is being held.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09102132000181"></a>We cannot believe that the solutions offered are something that we should be considering, when the Bill will be on the statute books for 20 or 30 years. Chilcot has reported, and we know what the conditions are; for all that the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, says, the implementation team is getting on very well with its work and can come to a conclusion in the very near future. So it is practical to look at this within the inquest system.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09102132000182"></a>The other thing that gives me great confidence that this is so is that, when we debated this matter before, the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, whom the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and I have both quoted this afternoon, was in support of this solution. As noble Lords will be aware, she chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09102132000185"></a>What we come back to is whether this is a principle that the Government want to establish in the heart of the Bill. The Minister said that the Conservative Party should think long and hard before supporting these amendments. Actually, I think that it is extremely depressing that the Government, with their alleged support of open government and transparency, should try to establish a principle in the heart of this Bill that avoids having the coronial system as the gold-plate system, which we need to see when somebody has died at the hands of the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09102132000186"></a>I understand all the practical arguments about the fact that mobile operators have a difficulty here, but that difficulty can be overcome, and we cannot allow important statutes to be dictated by the concerns of mobile operators. Of course, their staff have to be protected, but there are ways in which to do that. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, put his finger on it when he said that there were already provisions under Section 18 of RIPA that allow such evidence in court, in exceptional circumstances. We are talking about only a handful of inquests; they will always be exceptional. People who have died deserve no less than those in court in other circumstances. Given those issues, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Amendment 6&#151;I shall speak also to Amendments 9 and 10&#151;slightly put the clock back by suggesting that we ought to revert in this legislation to the wording of the Coroners Act 1988, particularly its Section 8(3). That provision specifies that, regardless of initial classification of the cause of death, an inquest must be held with a jury if the death occurred in prison or police custody or following police contact. The Bill proposes that some causes of death should not require a jury but my amendment suggests that we should revert to the old rule where a jury was required in those circumstances. Amendments 9 and 10 also ensure that an inquest with a jury is required in particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09102132000188"></a>Hidden among all of this is provision for including deaths in such places as psychiatric hospitals. My reasoning for such an amendment comes from a number of cases&#151;one in particular, where a young man met his death in a secure hospital some two and a half years ago. There have been continuous efforts to have that case investigated. Unfortunately the checks and balances that are now in the system&#151;for example, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is responsible for investigating unnatural deaths in prison, before inquests might be held&#151;do not apply in psychiatric hospitals. The Care Quality Commission has recently been formed,

However, I seriously believe that it makes sense to continue the status quo of the Coroners Act 1988. I therefore beg to move.</p>

He addressed the question of the inclusion of a jury and the problem of deaths in psychiatric hospitals&#151;something of which I am rather aware. The Government should seriously consider the proposition that these amendments put forward, and I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p><a name="09102132000238"></a>has been responsible for the death. The wording in the Bill is,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09102132000191"></a>I moved this amendment in Committee but it was dealt with rather disparagingly by the Minister at that time, who said, &#147;Well, there has never been a recorded instance of a death caused by a member of the security services&#148;. That was a pretty wide statement. He said that it had not occurred in 50 years. Clearly, if a member of the security services is employed to carry out functions very similar to those of a police officer, it may well happen. If it should happen, it would be a travesty for it to be said that a jury was not needed in such a case because it does not come within the Bill. When a member of the security services operates as such in the execution of his duty, he may be involved in a fatal incident. It is easy to see how it could happen in these days of terrorism. Accordingly, the same protection should be given by a jury in those cases as exists in relation to any police officer. I am speaking to that amendment now and will move it in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09102132000193"></a>These three amendments to Clause 7 make provision for inquests to be held into the deaths of individuals undergoing military training, or that of a young person while training or serving with Her Majesty&#146;s Armed Forces, where the death is violent or unnatural or the cause of death is unknown. The House will be aware that any death of a young person in the Armed Forces is a matter of great sensitivity. The Royal British Legion and others who assist the bereaved in such circumstances report that the relatives of the deceased very much want a formal inquest and to be kept as fully informed as possible.</p>

The Government&#146;s duty of care has increased and if, sadly, something goes wrong, there should be additional scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09102132000195"></a>Clause 7(2)(b) already makes provision for deaths resulting from an act or omission of a police officer or service police officer. My amendments would ensure that, were the death of a youth to occur under training in the Armed Forces, additional scrutiny into the circumstances and lessons learned can be followed up and implemented. These safeguards would help to ensure fair treatment for the youngest members of the Armed Forces, in line with the undertaking in last year&#146;s Command Paper 7424, <I>The Nation&#146;s Commitment: Cross-Government Support to Our Armed Forces</I><I>, their Families and Veterans</I>. Indeed, in the foreword to that Command Paper, the Prime Minister gave an explicit assurance to the Armed Forces. He was, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="09102132000280"></a>&#147;determined to ensure that they are fairly treated&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102132000196"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, responding for the Government, said that,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09102132000198"></a>I urge the Minister now to accept these amendments which are important to safeguarding the interests of young personnel who enter the Armed Forces, or to indicate what explicit steps are to be taken to ensure that the interests of the victims and that of their relatives are fully protected.</p>

I declare my interests as set out in the Register, in particular as a partner in the national commercial firm Beachcroft LLP.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09102132000200"></a>I am proud this week to be able to add to those interests the fact that I have just been elected a vice-chairman of JUSTICE, a post which my late colleague Lord Kingsland held with great distinction. He is sorely missed in many ways&#151;for example, when we discuss juries. I share his belief that the jury system is fundamental and must remain, despite the Government&#146;s efforts from time to time to abolish trial by jury in certain instances. Having a jury sit with a coroner is always the exception rather than the rule because the logistical and cost implications render such a move impractical. That is a reasonable line to take. However, the noble Lords&#146; amendments seek to extend the cases in which a jury is assembled. Although I have just said some cautionary words, we have consistently argued that inquests must be as transparent as possible. The jury system is an important feature of our coronial system; it is long established and well known. The presence of a jury in certain cases is a principle which we defend. For that reason we support some of the noble Lords&#146; amendments in this group. We see the merits of Amendment 6, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, Amendment 7, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and those in the name of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_740"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 740</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09102132000201"></a>As has been explained, Amendment 6 would remove the qualification that an inquest be heard with a jury if a death took place in the custody of the state only if the death was violent or unnatural or the causes of death were unexplained. Amendment 7 includes deaths resulting from the act or omission of a member of the security services. The Government may well point out that these are unnecessary additions, as Clause 7(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="09102132000274"></a>&#147;An inquest into a death may be held with a jury if the senior coroner thinks that there is sufficient reason for doing so&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102132000239"></a>However, the important point remains that the state bears a grave responsibility for the welfare of its citizens and of those who are supposed to enjoy&#151;and who have every right to expect to enjoy&#151;its protection. When something goes wrong as a result of an act or omission by an agent or institution of the state, public confidence is undermined. Juries are one way to help restore public confidence.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09102132000202"></a>As my honourable friend Henry Bellingham said in another place, we worry that jury inquests will become ever fewer in number. That is why we want to see fairness and transparency enshrined in the system. The more narrowly Clause 7 is drawn, the less frequently, we fear, it will be used. By widening it, we indicate that juries should not become a vanishingly rare phenomenon. For us, that is the greatest attraction of the noble Lords&#146; amendments.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09102132000203"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, referred to troops who are killed in training. We endorse his amendments. When we debate amendments to Clause 12, we will again touch on that issue, but we support his Amendment 11 as an important step in raising confidence that troops are being treated openly and fairly. The noble and gallant Lord points out that to differentiate between soldiers who are training and those on the front line is spurious, as all our troops are training for active service. We hope that the Government will find a form of words that recognises the importance of the points which he made.</p>

<a name="09102132000204"></a><b><a name="91021-0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09102132000997"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I start by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on his promotion to vice-chairman of JUSTICE, if that is the appropriate title. It is an honoured organisation and he deserves the accolade. I know it is particularly important to him because he is succeeding Lord Kingsland, whose wise words we have missed already today.</p>

<a name="91021-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09102132000205"></a>At present fewer than 500 inquests a year across the whole of England and Wales take place with a jury present. That is less than 2 per cent of the total number of inquests&#151;around 30,000 a year&#151;across the whole of the jurisdiction. Under the reformed system the vast majority of inquests, as the noble Lord said, will continue to take place without a jury and to be heard by a coroner sitting alone. Coroners are already men and women of independence of mind and increasingly well trained. Under the new regime there will be improved recruitment procedures with the aim of appointing coroners of an even higher calibre. They will be even better trained and, under the leadership of the Chief Coroner, part of a more structured and better organised profession. It is therefore right that they should continue to hear most cases sitting alone and require a jury present only when a clear and demonstrable need for an additional independent level of public scrutiny demands it.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09102132000206"></a>I remind the House, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, forecast that I would, that the Bill already contains clear provision at Clause 7(3) to give coroners discretion to summon a jury if they feel there is sufficient reason for doing so, even if the death concerned does not strictly fall into the categories mentioned in Clause 7(2). This is a discretionary power that we expect coroners to make use of in a variety of situations and scenarios as and when they see fit. In addition, we foresee the Chief Coroner issuing guidance as to when it would be expected that coroners may wish to exercise this discretionary power to call a jury, even if the coroner is not legally obliged to do so. There is also the safeguard of the provision in Clause 35(2)(g), where an interested person may appeal to the Chief Coroner if they feel that the coroner should have exercised his or her discretion differently. We therefore think that we have in place under the new regime a structure to ensure that cases that genuinely require it will have an inquest with a jury present.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09102132000207"></a>On Amendment 6, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, we see no useful purpose in maintaining the status quo in relation to prison deaths and requiring that all deaths in prison, whatever their cause, should be investigated by way of an inquest held with a jury. If there is any reason to suspect the death was of violent, unnatural or unknown cause, the coroner will have to hold any inquest with a jury. I see no need for a jury inquest for a death from wholly natural causes in a prison hospital, for example, when a similar death, should it occur in a general hospital, would almost certainly not even warrant an investigation, let alone an inquest with a jury.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09102132000208"></a>There would, of course, continue to be an inquest into deaths in prison which do not fall within Clause 7(2)(a). I am in danger of repeating myself, but if the coroner feels that there is a need to call a jury because, for example, concerns about the standards of care, even though irrelevant to the cause of death, emerge from preliminary investigations, then he or she may summon a jury under the discretionary powers outlined in Clause 7(3). It may be the case in future that investigating natural deaths in prison or other forms of state detention is an area on which the Chief Coroner chooses to issue guidance or arrange for further specialist training for coroners.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09102132000209"></a>On Amendment 7, we entirely understand the argument that an inquest into the death of a person caused by an act or omission of a member of the security services should be held with a jury. I am sorry if I appeared disparaging to the noble Lord when we debated this matter last time; I certainly did not intend to be. However, I have to repeat that we are unaware of any such deaths being subject to inquests within at least the last 50 years. That being the case, I remain unpersuaded that there is a need for the amendment. The powers already contained in the Bill will be sufficient to ensure that any inquest into such a death in the future could take place with a jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09102132000210"></a>Amendment 9 would retain the provision in the Coroners Act 1988 that requires that an inquest must be held with a jury if,</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09102132000282"></a>&#147;the death occurred in circumstances the continuance or possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to the health or safety of the public or any section of the public&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102132000211"></a>We do not support this amendment because of the potential that it contains for substantially increasing the number of inquests that would require a jury to be summoned. This could include, for example, road traffic incidents. It has been argued by some campaigners that almost all road traffic deaths involve issues of public safety and that, therefore, all inquests into them should be held with a jury. At present, this is not usually the case, as many coroners choose to interpret the legislation so as not to include such deaths. In fact, if you were to interpret it otherwise, it could be argued that in very many cases you were predetermining the outcome of the inquest.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09102132000212"></a>Should this provision remain on the face of primary legislation, as this amendment would allow, there are genuine concerns, I submit, that there would be considerable pressure for this criterion to be more widely interpreted and more generally applied, meaning that a jury would be required in a considerably greater number of cases. Obviously, this would have a major effect on the resources required to conduct a substantially increased number of inquests with juries, but it would not, in our opinion, enhance the effectiveness of those inquests.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09102132000213"></a>Turning to Amendment 10, I again reiterate our view that only those cases that genuinely need a further and additional layer of independent scrutiny should take place with a jury. This amendment would mean that there would need to be a jury in all cases where it may be considered that an inquest might find that an act or omission on the part of the state or a public authority or its employees contributed to the death. Given the wide-ranging nature of what could be considered as a public authority, this could mean that, for example, all deaths reported to a coroner from an NHS hospital where the coroner felt than an inquest was required may in future require a jury, as an NHS trust would be considered as a public authority. Having a jury in each such instance where a public authority may be implicated would substantially increase the number of jury inquests, with a consequent dramatic and serious impact on resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09102132000214"></a>Amendments 8, 11 and 12 were tabled by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley. The House will know that currently coroners sit alone for the most part when considering the deaths of military personnel on active service. Our understanding is that, on the whole, the bereaved families support this; they want the coroner to sit on his or her own when dealing with their cases. This has not, however, prevented coroners from successfully carrying out investigations into those deaths and investigating all such deaths with a commendable, if sometimes uncomfortable for the Government, degree of vigour and thoroughness; on occasions, they have passed judgments and made comments that have been critical of parts of government. There is no reason to believe that they do not and will not deal with any less rigour with the deaths of military personnel who have been undertaking training or who are under the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09102132000215"></a>As I said, the Bill already contains provisions giving coroners discretion to summon a jury if they feel that

There is also the safeguard of a right of appeal to the Chief Coroner if the family feels that the coroner should exercise his or her discretion differently. Our view is that these provisions are sufficient to enable the coroner to summon a jury when he or she feels that it is the correct thing to do.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09102132000216"></a>On a more general point, if Article 2 is engaged in a particular inquest, there is nothing in the case law of the European Convention on Human Rights that requires such an inquest to be held with a jury. We maintain, therefore, that the state can meet its Article 2 obligations by a coroner sitting alone or with a jury where there is sufficient reason.</p>

If I heard the Minister aright, he said that there was no ground for maintaining the status quo, which, if I understand it correctly, requires that whenever a death takes place in state detention or in custody there shall be an inquest with a jury. Why does he suppose that there is such public confidence in our arrangements for state detention and custody as to warrant departing from the status quo, which has been in existence for a period of years?</p>

<ul><a name="09102132000283"></a>&#147;the death was ... violent or unnatural ... or ... the cause of death is unknown&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102132000240"></a>We are adding cases in psychiatric hospitals and immigration detention centres. However, our view is that, if a death in custody is quite clearly natural, there is no need for an inquest with a jury. There would not be one for any other natural death, so there should not necessarily be one for a death in prison. That is the change that we are making in the Bill. We are adding some areas of custody if the death was violent or unnatural or the cause of death is unknown, but we are saying that, if deaths in custody are natural, there does not need to be a jury, although there can always be one if the coroner feels that there should be one.</p>

Why, in the majority of cases of natural death, should the coroner not decide on the form of inquest? There will always be an inquest when someone dies in custody: the issue is whether there has to be a jury. I repeat that the failsafe here is that if the coroner, in the case of what looks like a natural death, thinks that there should be a jury hearing, he is entitled to have one under Clause 7.</p>

I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for mentioning juries in a wider context than I did. I came at this from the understanding that the purpose of a jury in these inquests is to see that incidents of possible negligence are properly investigated. When I was Chief Inspector of Prisons, I saw cases of negligence that led to prisoners dying. They may have died from natural causes, but, looking at the circumstances in which they had been looked after&#151;I am thinking of one case in particular&#151;people must have asked questions about their treatment. Therefore, I can see good reason for changing the rules that have been in existence since the Coroners Act 1988.</p>

Reading the record of the Committee, it seemed that the argument was effectively destroyed, and I was surprised that it was raised again. I will come back to the question of the discretion of the coroner. Under current legislation, this discretion has frequently been a matter of contention, because it has contributed to inconsistency in practice. That is one purpose of the Bill, and of having a Chief Coroner: to try to eliminate inconsistency, particularly in cases where the death has been at the hands of the state. However, I am grateful that the issues have been raised and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09102142000009"></a>I respectfully suggest to the House that the importance of having bereaved families properly represented is always viewed one way. Why is that? It is because inquests that include bereaved families and public authorities, such as the police, the Prison Service or the military, involve highly contentious issues, one of which is often the question of disclosure&#151;a matter that we discussed a little earlier today in the context of intercept evidence. At times it is necessary to make applications for the disclosure of information but the demands of the bereaved families are often at odds with what the state and public authorities wish to maintain. In military inquests, the MoD often raises national security as a reason for non-disclosure or redaction, but sometimes, upon challenge by legal representatives of the bereaved, this turns out to be nothing more than embarrassing or problematic evidence against the state. Therefore, when it is necessary to tease out problems of disclosure and the provision of information, legal representation is very necessary.</p>

<a name="91021-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09102142000010"></a>However, interested parties may sometimes face criticism. I remind your Lordships of the inquest into the death of James Collinson, a young recruit who died at Deepcut barracks. In that case, two soldiers who were on duty with the deceased at the time of his death were separately represented by independent counsel at the inquest, funded by the taxpayer, and advised by lawyers provided for them by the Ministry of Defence. These were two people who could conceivably be implicated in the death at Deepcut and they had full legal representation paid for by the taxpayer. That is in addition to the Ministry of Defence, which would always be separately represented, again at the taxpayer&#146;s expense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09102142000011"></a>In another Deepcut inquest into the death of Geoff Gray, members of the family were told by the coroners&#146; office that did not need legal representation, so they

The inquest was over in half a day, during which the bereaved family experienced witnesses being prompted from the public gallery, and there were no disclosure arguments. That is a matter of great concern.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09102142000012"></a>Families that appear at inquests trying to find out what has happened to the deceased person are at a considerable disadvantage if they have no one representing them against the battery of lawyers who are provided by the state not just for the departments involved but also for people who might be implicated. It is quite wrong that they should be in that position.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09102142000013"></a>That is the basis of my argument, but how much would it cost if the provisions set out in my amendment were carried through? The best estimate that we have is from the ministry, which says that the cost of representation at an inquest is about &#163;8,000 a time, and we are dealing with a maximum of 400 cases. I think that the Ministry of Justice itself has suggested that the cost of providing this service would be some &#163;6.4 million, some of which could be recovered under decided cases in the event of a family being successful in recovering compensation as a result of negligence or something else being proved against the department of state. Therefore, the cost of these provisions is not huge.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09102142000014"></a>We come to the question of means-testing. There have been many cases under the present arrangement whereby the Minister in the case of the Army and the Legal Services Commission in the case of the police and the Prison Service have discretion to permit legal aid to be given to bereaved families subject to a means test. Very intrusive investigations have been made, and in some the home of a bereaved family, for example, has been taken into account. In one case, the money that was to be made available to the family as a result of the death of the deceased was also taken into account. We do not think that that is the right way to proceed. If the taxpayer pays entirely for the state departments to be represented, then, for the purposes of equality of arms, one would expect the state to allow the bereaved families not to have to undergo the indignity of means-testing and the taking into account of sums of money which may be very important to them in the position in which they find themselves.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09102142000015"></a>Those are the reasons why all these organisations, fulfilling the demands of the reports to which I have drawn your Lordships&#146; attention, suggest that the only proper way forward is to provide non-means-tested legal aid funds to bereaved families at inquests. That is the purpose of the amendment, and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09102147000001"></a><b><a name="91021-0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09102147000051"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, we move now to another part of the Bill which addresses the outcome of investigations. I refer to another Bill that addresses the issue of deaths in prison&#151;the corporate manslaughter Bill. This House voted for the Prison Service to be included in that legislation and said that any managerial failure that resulted in death should be subject to the conditions of that legislation.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09102147000002"></a>The issue in an inquest is responsibility for death and not liability; it is not up to the inquest to establish that. Currently there is a prohibition on inquests naming persons publicly. Although we think that that prohibition should be retained, a coroner or a jury should be free to describe acts or omissions by the particular public service&#151;and I admit that I speak mainly from experience of prisons&#151;responsible for that death. That emphasises the responsibility aspect of inquests. To protect the parties who might be criticised, the Bill should contain a clause that underscores the fact that a determination of the inquest should not affect anyone&#146;s criminal or civil liability and that a determination should not be admissible as evidence in any subsequent legal proceedings. In other words it would distance the matter from further action once responsibility has been laid.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09102147000003"></a>It is difficult entirely to separate an inquest from all the duties on the state to learn about how deaths have occurred. In its briefing to us on this matter, Inquest has said that Scotland has a much better system. Under its fatal accident inquiry procedures, the sheriff is allowed to determine, among other things, where and when the death and any accident resulting in the death took place; the cause or causes of the death and any such accident; the reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the death and any accident resulting in the death might have been avoided; the defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the death or any accident resulting in the death; and any other facts relevant to the circumstances of the death.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09102147000004"></a>In an earlier debate we discussed the fact that something that might be applicable in England and Wales was not applicable in Scotland. I have always thought it inexplicable that such clear direction and definition should be available in Scotland but not in England and Wales. I would certainly like to see that in any improved legislation, which this is.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09102147000005"></a>There is also a debate as to whether a coroner may or may not use judgmental words such as &#147;serious&#148; or &#147;unreasonable&#148;. Frankly, that debate is probably not worth having, because the various checks and balances that have been put in place have moved us on from that. All that is needed is merely a clear statement from a coroner that something has happened and that someone is responsible.</p>

<a name="91021-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09102147000006"></a>On investigations, and bearing in mind our previous brief discussion on the representation of families, I have always been concerned about the attendance of families at inquests. Frequently, they do not know anything other than that a relative has died. They expect an inquest to be an inquiry. They think that they will learn far more than they otherwise might. That is not a fault of the coronial system; that is a fault of the prison system, which does not pass on sufficient information. It is important that the coroners bear in mind the possibility that the families appearing  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_751"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before them are not as well informed as they might expect, or as well informed by the state as they might expect them to be. The families will always expect more to come out. The naming of names is prohibited but I believe that families will feel better served by the system if it is possible to name the acts or omissions that might have contributed to the death. And that is one of the intentions of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

In a sense we are returning to territory similar to that which we discussed under Amendment 3 and Clause 5 regarding the coroner&#146;s grounds for exploration, expansion and expressing his or her findings. One needs to be careful about other legal interventions, but it seems strange that a coroner&#151;in making his or her inquiries about why a death occurred, what contributed to it and what could have been done to prevent it and, indeed, to avoid other deaths&#151;should be discouraged from venturing into that terrain. This amendment seeks to open up that ground. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, that should not be a matter of great difficulty, because the situation in Scotland is pretty much the same as that described in these amendments. We need families to feel that there has been proper inquiry and investigation and that the outcome is stated as fully as possible in accordance with the requirements of all the legal processes, whether criminal or civil. My colleagues and I wish to express our support for the amendment.</p>

I appreciate the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and I can see the advantage in seeking to do what he says&#151;to set out what an inquest can and cannot do in relation to findings that could be said to relate to criminal or civil liability. In defence of the Minister&#151;not that he ever needs defending&#151;Clause 10(2) clearly states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="09102147000042"></a>&#147;A determination under subsection (1)(a) may not be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="09102147000044"></a>(b) civil liability&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102147000038"></a>That seems right. The determination of criminal or civil liability for an act or omission on the part of an individual is a matter for separate courts, not the coroner&#146;s court. I would not want to see the risk arise of a trial&#151;possibly, given the circumstances, a very serious trial for murder or manslaughter&#151;being prejudiced by findings at a coronial inquest that is, according to Clause 5, an investigation into who the deceased was and how he came about his death. The blame element&#151;who is liable&#151;is a matter for other courts that apply different rules. I understand the reference made to the position in Scotland, and I share the resolve to ensure that an inquest gets to the bottom of the facts surrounding a death. Everything that can be done to seek out the truth should be done. However, I am cautious about the amendment because I am wary of allowing findings of fact to stray into comment upon matters that properly lie with another court. I am glad that we have had a chance to debate this, and I am looking forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09102147000009"></a>Amendment 17, which makes clear that Amendment 16 should not prevent a description of the circumstances surrounding a death, reinforces the criteria that are to be looked at in Clause 5.

I hope that he will be able to reassure us on the correct role of different courts and the independence of coronial inquests.</p>

We are concerned that these amendments might take the coroner system down the road of expressing opinion and possibly even attributing blame and assigning civil or criminal liability. That is not the purpose of a coroner&#146;s investigation and, in our view, that position should remain. The purpose of the investigation is to establish facts and responsibility, where appropriate; it is not to attribute blame or to decide matters of legal liability.

The case that I was going to refer to was not the noble Lord&#146;s well known case, but another quite well known case, back in 1975, when a coroner&#146;s jury named the missing and&#151;I should say it properly&#151;noble Lord, Lord Lucan, as guilty of the murder of his children&#146;s nanny. There was widespread concern about that, so a possible repeat was prevented by the Criminal Law Act 1977, which excluded the question of criminal liability from the matters to be determined by an inquest. The purpose of Clause 5 is therefore to ensure that the coroners system remains based on an inquisitorial process charged with finding fact rather than apportioning blame or determining liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09102147000014"></a>The prohibition on framing a determination that may appear to determine criminal liability on the part of a named person or to determine civil liability is to ensure that the proceedings are fair. An individual or body who might be identified as liable would not have been afforded the safeguards to enable them to defend such a conclusion, as they have no right to call evidence.</p>

This is what the law has been since 1977, and it has worked reasonably well. Undoubtedly a coroner has occasionally appeared to suggest that he or she might have made a certain finding, but, in the vast majority of cases, coroners know precisely what their role is and we are not suggesting any change to it.

Factual conclusions on such matters may be recorded, but in a way that does not infringe Clause 10(2). A finding that there was a failure to act in a particular way does not appear to determine a question of civil liability and would therefore be acceptable.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09102147000020"></a>In relation to Amendment 17, some of the matters these amendments touch on are matters that are far more suited to coroners&#146; reports to prevent future deaths than to any findings or determinations a coroner or a jury might make. A coroner could quite properly and legitimately give his or her views on such matters in any report to prevent future deaths. We place great store on these reports, which are currently made under Rule 43 of the Coroners Rules. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked me where this is to be found; it is under paragraph 6 of Schedule 5, as strengthened by the Government&#146;s amendments.</p>

At present, the test is that there is a good reason not to adjourn. We are really not all at clear about the rationale for this change. When we suggested changes in the previous debate on this, the Minister said that it was working perfectly well.

It allows for coroners to continue their investigation if they consider there to be exceptional reasons to do so when there is an ongoing criminal investigation. The amendment would lower this threshold to having a good reason not to suspend the investigation.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09102142000026"></a>As the Government stated in Committee, we must begin with the proposition that it is appropriate for the coroner to suspend his or her investigation if a person is charged with a serious offence connected to the death. Otherwise, the coroner&#146;s investigation could duplicate a criminal inquiry and possibly even impede or lengthen it. In addition, the &#147;exceptional&#148; threshold is the right one, considering that the relevant offence is a homicide offence, a service equivalent, or an offence related to the death in some other way. However, even though the coroner&#146;s investigation may be suspended, matters relating to the post-mortem and the release of the body of the deceased person to families may still be dealt with by the coroner.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09102142000027"></a>Schedule 1 also provides for the prosecuting authority to indicate to the coroner that it has no objection to the continuing investigation. However, coroners are very aware of the importance of criminal proceedings, particularly as part of the bereaved family seeing that justice is done, and will rarely want to continue an investigation in these circumstances. This might be another area in which the chief coroner issues guidance to cover the rare cases in which a coroner&#146;s investigation should continue.</p>

I am therefore a little surprised that he has not taken the opportunity, even when invited by the noble and learned Baroness, to explain when and at what stages there was ever any problem with what pertains at present. He has made his arguments, but he has not indicated in any way where they were alerted to this and why there was a problem.

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09102142000034"></a>In Committee, I explained that I had two points of concern about Clause 12. One was the definition of active service in subsection (6), which relied on Section 8 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This is a most inappropriate definition to use for those who have been killed on operational service, as Section 8 deals solely with the offence of desertion. The Minister agreed, and he has now proposed a new definition of active service in his Amendment 31. Although I welcome this change of heart, I raised a further point in Committee about this clause. Is it right to attempt to draw a distinction between service personnel who were killed or died of wounds while on active service or in training for active service, and other members of the Armed

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09102142000035"></a>I remind the House of the Government&#146;s Command Paper 7424, which was published with much acclaim only last year. In this paper, all government departments and devolved Administrations have collectively undertaken to treat fairly all members of the Armed Forces, their families, and veterans. Surely it is a blatant breach of that promise to attempt to draw some dividing line between service personnel who die in one operational theatre and those who die overseas elsewhere. Indeed, the Minister&#146;s letter to me of 22 May, which was placed in the Library, said as much. He wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09102142000083"></a>&#147;The families of service personnel who have died abroad other than on active service are no less deserving of consideration&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09102142000037"></a>In Committee, I proposed amendments similar to Amendments 28, 29 and 30, which would remove references to active service. The Minister resisted my amendments on the grounds that to accept them would,</p>
<ul><a name="09102142000086"></a>&#147;pre-empt the outcome of the independent review of the fatal accident inquiry legislation that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen,&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/09; col. 732.]</ul>
<p><a name="09102142000061"></a>was undertaking. I have since spoken to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, who I am delighted to see on the Bench beside me, and he most considerately wrote me a note for which I am most grateful. I had his permission to pass the content of the note to the Minister, which I did last Wednesday. The Minister will therefore know what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, said in his note. He pointed out that legislation for the specific purpose of inquiring into the deaths abroad of Scottish members of the Armed Forces was not within the competence of the Scottish Parliament&#151;defence not being a devolved matter, as indicated in paragraph (9) of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09102142000038"></a>The note from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, is clear. This subject is not within his remit. Indeed, he went on to say that, in view of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, about pre-emption, to which I have referred, so far as my amendments are concerned, if they fell within paragraph (9) of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act, they would have no relevance to his inquiry. In so far as they went beyond paragraph (9), they would not be in conflict with the approach taken by the noble and learned Lord in his review. So, pre-emption there is none.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09102142000039"></a>The Minister&#146;s Amendment 31 refers to Section 374 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 with a definition of the word &#147;enemy&#148; to flesh out the meaning of his amendment. This would say that active service means service against all persons engaged in armed operations, against all powers, armed mutineers, armed rebels and armed rioters. But Clause 12(2) goes much wider than active service alone. It includes activities,</p>
<ul><a name="09102142000087"></a>&#147;in preparation for, or directly in support of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09102142000062"></a>and training for active service. I would contend that any service man or woman on duty is involved in training for, preparing for or supporting service against persons engaged in armed operations&#151;against pirates, armed mutineers, rebels or rioters. That is what armed forces do.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09102142000040"></a>It seems to me that this clause, with the Minister&#146;s revised definition for &#147;active service&#148; in subsection (6), introduces a distinction without a difference. However, by removing the references to active service in this clause, my amendments seek to correct this and be seen to treat equally fairly families of all members of the Armed Forces who suffer an untimely death overseas on duty, whether as a result of being killed in action, dying of wounds or due to some other mishap which proves fatal and requires an inquest following repatriation of the deceased. This would also accord with the heading for Clauses 12 and 13, <I>Death of service personnel abroad</I>.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09102142000041"></a>I understand that Clauses 12 and 13 were rushed in to meet the general concerns of those most affected at the present time of high operational tempo and regrettable casualties. The way in which Clause 12(6) would be revised by Amendment 31, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, only serves further to highlight the fact that Clause 12 does not appear to meet the requirement to treat all service personnel fairly, nor does it tie in with the heading of this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09102142000042"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, I am fully in support of the unique and caring arrangements being made in Clauses 12 and 13 for the actual handling of inquests into the deaths of service personnel abroad. These introduce flexibility in the location of the inquest in order to meet the wishes of the next of kin of the deceased who want to attend. That is most important and highly desirable. I commend the Government for that approach, but it must clearly be seen to apply to all service personnel.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09102142000043"></a>On reflection, I hope that the Minister will accept that the inquiry made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, is not being pre-empted. To introduce special arrangements for some classification of casualties in the Armed Forces overseas, but not for others, breaches the thrust of Command 7424 to treat all service personnel and their families fairly. Is this aspect not a defence matter and therefore not devolved to the Scottish Parliament? For the rest of the two clauses about the location of arrangements, both Governments are in accord and have wide public support for this arrangement. I urge the Government to accept my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

One might say that the Government have shot themselves in the foot over that one. Accordingly, the amendments proposed by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, are fully deserving of support and we support them.</p>

Perhaps I may start by saying how grateful I am for the noble and gallant Lord&#146;s support in general for Clauses 12 and 13 and what they represent. As the noble and gallant Lord has said, Clause 12, in conjunction with the amendments to the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 in Clause 45, provides for fatal accident inquiries to be held in Scotland into deaths abroad of service personnel on active service.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09102142000049"></a>We added these clauses to the Bill in the other place to respond to calls from service families in Scotland, from MPs and from MSPs to make provision for families in Scotland to attend fatal accident inquiries into deaths which have occurred on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This means that in most cases such families will no longer need to travel long distances to England for an inquest. Clause 12 seeks to address that human issue. Clause 12 arises out of an agreement reached by the UK Government and what is now called the Scottish Government. Our argument is around that agreement and whether it would be responsible to unpick that agreement, which is in effect what we would do unilaterally if this amendment were to be passed. Amendments 28, 29 and 30 would remove the requirement for the personnel covered by this clause to have been on active service or accompanying those on active service when they die, so that the Lord Advocate could permit a fatal accident inquiry into the violent or unnatural death overseas of any service personnel.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09102142000050"></a>When considering similar amendments in Committee, I explained that I understood that Scottish Ministers would consider whether the Bill&#146;s provisions should be extended to cover the deaths of service personnel which occur in non-operational circumstances as part of their wider consideration of the recommendations of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen. Noble Lords will remember that the noble and learned Lord&#146;s review of fatal accident inquiry legislation in Scotland is due to report later this year. His review is, of course, concerned only with

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09102142000051"></a>I agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, that we are not pre-empting the report of the Cullen inquiry, but we are pre-empting the Scottish Government&#146;s consideration of that report. It is for the Scottish Government&#151;whether we like it or not&#151;to consider what changes to make to the legislation governing fatal accident inquiries following the Cullen inquiry.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09102142000052"></a>I remind the House that the provisions in Clause 12 seek to address a specific issue that has arisen as a result of our Armed Forces engagement in operations in the two theatres of Iraq and Afghanistan. The clause reflects the terms of an agreement between the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish Government on how best to respond to representations from service families. We are talking to the Scottish Government. The provisions in the Bill relate to the deaths of Armed Forces personnel on active service, and are the outcome, I emphasise, of prolonged negotiations between my department, the Ministry of Defence, the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09102142000053"></a>Speaking from this Dispatch Box, I cannot simply throw out of the window our agreement with Scottish Ministers, but I readily agree to have further talks before Third Reading with the Scottish Government. I cannot promise to change our position, but I would like to see what is possible. Anyone in government would agree that we need to bring Scottish Ministers with us on this issue, because, ultimately, the circumstances in which there must be a fatal accident inquiry in Scotland will be a matter for them. That would be true even if we were talking about an agreement made with an unfriendly Administration or Government. It cannot be for us to unpick something that has been agreed between Governments because it happens to suit us.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09102142000054"></a>I invite the noble and gallant Lord to withdraw his amendment today. I will keep him fully informed of how the discussions go with the Scottish Government. If they are getting nowhere, of course he will put down his amendment at Third Reading and, no doubt if we still resist it, take it to a vote. However, today I ask him for a little further time to try to see if we can come to an agreement with the Scottish Government, with whom we have an arrangement on this matter. I invite him to desist from asking the House to express its opinion.</p>

<a name="91021-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09102142000055"></a>As the noble and gallant Lord was kind enough to say, government Amendment 31 responds to a concern raised by him in Committee about the definition of &#147;active service&#148; in Clause 12(6). That subsection cross-refers to the definition of &#147;active service&#148; set out in the Armed Forces Act 2006&#151;a section which deals with the offence of desertion. The noble and gallant Lord argued persuasively&#151;as he always does&#151;that it was inappropriate to use that source definition for those who have been killed on operational service, serving their country. The noble and gallant Lord suggested that, rather than cross-referring to the Armed Forces Act, we should instead set out the definition of &#147;active service&#148; in full in Clause 12(6). That is exactly what we have done in Amendment 31, which places the definition of &#147;active

Under the HFE Act 2008, the maximum period for which gametes or embryos may be stored was set at 10 years. The regulations before us replace regulations approved in 1991 and 1996 and provide for the circumstances under which the storage period for both gametes and embryos may be extended beyond 10 years. The new criterion for extension is that a person, as a result of medical treatment or a medical condition, has been rendered, or is likely to be rendered, prematurely infertile. In addition, the group of persons able to avail of extended storage is wider than before. Up to now, an eligible person has been either a man or a woman as provider of sperm or eggs, or a woman receiving treatment at an IVF clinic who requires an embryo to be implanted in her in order to conceive. In the future, &#147;eligible persons&#148; will be extended to include people who need to use donated gametes or embryos or a surrogate in order to conceive.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09102147000025"></a>There is also a change to the maximum extension period. Under the existing regulations, gametes or embryos may be stored until the gamete provider or woman to be treated reaches the age of 55. In the regulations before us, the age limit is replaced by a time limit; namely, a maximum storage period of 55 years. After the initial storage period, an extension may be granted for a further period of 10 years, provided that the premature infertility criterion continues to be met. Additional 10-year extensions would then be permissible after that, subject to the same proviso.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09102147000026"></a>I have called this debate because I believe that these regulations take us into ethical territory which, as far as I am aware, has not hitherto been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny. It is ethical territory which, in my opinion, should concern us. There are two main issues that I want to raise. The first is the legal scope created by these regulations for the intergenerational transfer of gametes or embryos. The second is the green light which the Government are apparently giving to the idea of a person or a couple entering into parenthood at an advanced age. When the HFE Act 2008 was being debated in another place, the case was raised of a mother wishing to store her eggs in order to be able to donate them in future to her infertile daughter, who had been born with Turner syndrome, which is a chromosomal disorder that affects about one in 2,500 girls and which almost always entails infertility.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_764"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 764</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09102147000027"></a>Under the previous regulations, extended storage of gametes or embryos is prohibited if they are intended for donation to another person. That prohibition is lifted in the regulations now before us. There are several consequences of that, but the one I want to focus on is the kind of case cited in the Explanatory Note, in which a mother with a prematurely infertile daughter, born with Turner syndrome, wishes to put her own eggs into extended storage for her daughter&#146;s future use. It seems quite extraordinary that the department and your Lordships&#146; Merits Committee have nowhere explicitly spelt out, let alone discussed, the implications of this. It means that the infertile daughter would give birth to her own half-sister or half-brother. The provider of the egg would at one and the same time be grandmother and genetic mother of the child so produced. Furthermore, if the mother of the infertile daughter were to use her own egg to create an embryo, which was then stored for her daughter&#146;s eventual use, the daughter would be both the mother and the full sister of the child so produced.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09102147000028"></a>Noble Lords may react in different ways to that idea but, for my own part, I struggle to come to terms with the assumption implicit here that a confused genetic identity of this sort has no impact on the welfare of the child. On the contrary, the impact on the child&#146;s psychological welfare is potentially very significant, when they realise in adulthood who exactly they are. There are also societal implications. It is not accidental that marriage between a woman and her son-in-law is legally prohibited in this country. The origins of this prohibition lie in the <I>Old Testament</I>, but the rationale behind it has to do with the cohesion of society and the undesirability of destroying the traditional structures of kinship. The more one muddies these relationship waters, the more the confusion about the extent of consanguinity in any particular relationship and the more risk there is of genetic abnormalities occurring in children. These are the reasons why we have the Marriage Act in this country, and I do not think that we can simply nod through a set of regulations that have the effect of driving a coach and horses through established societal norms of this significance. As far as I am aware, there is no guidance by the HFEA relating specifically to consanguineous donation of gametes or embryos in the context of the requirement to consider the welfare of the child. That seems to me a very bad omission.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09102147000029"></a>When the Minister was kind enough to facilitate a meeting for me last week with departmental officials, the answer that they gave to me when I raised these issues was that intergenerational donation of gametes and embryos is permitted at the moment. All the regulations do is to allow it to happen in a wider range of circumstances. Frankly, I was surprised by that answer; for a start, I do not believe that we have any data to tell us how many or how few cases of intergenerational transfer there have been up to now. The central point is surely that the kinds of situation that Parliament originally envisaged when it considered permitting the extended storage of gametes or embryos were those in which the gametes or embryos were intended for the person&#146;s own use. Extended storage of gametes and embryos for someone else&#146;s use was made explicitly illegal.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_765"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 765</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09102147000030"></a>I have not been able to find any reference in <I>Hansard</I> to a debate in either House at any time in which the ethical implications of mother-to-child donation of gametes or embryos or, for that matter, any other donation between close relatives, has been discussed. It may be true that the 1991 and 1996 regulations permitted such donations by default, but it is quite another matter for Parliament to approve regulations whose express purpose is to facilitate them. I therefore need to ask the Minister whether she will take steps to request the HFEA to give further consideration to the ethical implications of intergenerational and interfamilial donation and to drawing up specific guidance relating to it.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09102147000031"></a>Unfortunately, while counselling is offered whenever IVF treatment is being contemplated, that offer does not have to be taken up. On the other hand, there is a requirement that any treatment should take place only with informed consent. Personally, I would argue that fully informed consent is impossible in this area without an appreciation of the moral hazards involved. The fact that relatives donating gametes or embryos may have altruistic motives does not make such donation ethically or socially desirable.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09102147000032"></a>The second situation that these regulations apparently aim to facilitate is that of elderly parenthood. As I mentioned, the criterion for granting an extension of the 10-year storage period is that the person concerned is, or is likely to be, prematurely infertile. No definition is given of what &#147;prematurely&#148; means in practice. Indeed, the Government have studiously avoided any attempt to give one. For a woman, it may be thought that 55 represents about the limit of natural child-bearing age. For a man, I doubt whether there is any medically agreed limit, since men have been known to father children well into their 80s and even their 90s. Only one doctor&#146;s opinion will now be needed to certify that the person is prematurely infertile; the scope for subjective judgment here is wide. We are therefore looking at very different set of possibilities in these regulations from those which have obtained up to now, with the automatic cut-off of age 55. I quite appreciate the reasons why, for a man, it was felt that the age limit was inappropriate. Up to now a man aged 55 wishing to avail of extended storage of his sperm has been unable to do so, which is clearly unfair and arbitrary. But given that the rules need changing, the first question to ask is what the reason is for choosing an across-the-board time limit of 55 years. Why 55?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09102147000033"></a>Under these assumptions, an infertile woman, aged 53, whose eggs had been in storage for 30 or 40 years, could credibly claim that she was prematurely infertile and therefore eligible to have her eggs kept in extended storage for another 10 years, well beyond normal child-bearing age, at which point she might choose to have a child by surrogacy. She could do the same with an embryo. An infertile man in his mid-70s could credibly make a similar claim as a reason for storing his sperm. If that kind of request is not to be ruled out of court altogether, under what circumstances should it be granted? What are the questions that a clinic should ask itself? As I have said, there is a legal requirement to consider the welfare of the potential child, including the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting,  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_766"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 766</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but what exactly does that consideration entail? The woman or man making the request might well be viewed as someone highly likely to be a supportive and loving parent. Does that mean that their age should be regarded as immaterial? The fact that the Government have blithely inserted a 55-year maximum time limit into these regulations would seem to suggest that it is immaterial.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09102147000034"></a>Paragraph 29 of the evidence base document published by the department refers to the premature infertility test and makes the claim:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09102147000045"></a>&#147;This test will prevent people from storing gametes or embryos after the average natural childbearing age&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102147000039"></a>That statement is simply not true. The regulations as they stand would allow people to be granted an extension of storage to a point well beyond natural childbearing age without any check, other than the test of premature infertility.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09102147000035"></a>It is only very recently that Parliament voted for the maximum storage period for embryos and gametes to be set at 10 years. It is therefore, to say the least, a surprise for us to be considering a maximum limit of 55 years so soon afterwards. Indeed, it is not at all satisfactory in my opinion that such radically different rules with the ethical implications that they carry should be introduced by means of a negative instrument. I should like to hear from the Minister whether the HFEA has discussed the issues to which I have referred, and whether it has considered issuing guidance on the matters that clinics should take into account when presented with a request for extended storage by an individual who is, or soon will be, beyond the average age for childbearing or initial parenthood. This matter should not simply be allowed to go by default or left entirely to the discretion of individual clinics. If there is a policy either to discourage or encourage elderly parenthood for those who are deemed prematurely infertile, we are entitled to know about it.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09102147000036"></a>I wish to make one final point before closing. During the passage of the 2008 Act, we debated the issue of saviour siblings&#151;embryos created with a genetic profile designed to enable a brother or a sister to receive treatment for a fatal or serious condition. At the time I referred to this idea as being on the cusp of ethical acceptability. I still believe that. The regulations would allow a saviour sibling embryo to be kept in extended storage for 55 years, subject only to one or other parent having become prematurely infertile or being likely to become prematurely infertile. Having thought about this, I can envisage no circumstances in which such storage could be ethically justified. Why are the Government allowing it?</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09102147000037"></a>Looking at the regulations, I think that what is at stake here is the standing and credibility of our systems for delivering assisted conception in this country. In my judgment, that standing is not assisted by what is effectively a complete absence of ethical way-marking posts laid down by Parliament or even by the HFEA as the proxy guardian of ethical standards in this area. Will the Minister take steps to rectify that? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09102150000002"></a>I am a member of the Merits Committee. When the issue came before us, we viewed it with considerable concern but, perhaps in defence of the committee for the brief word of criticism of it, it is fair to say that it is our practice to be cautious in our comments. Indeed, the facts speak for themselves, and we raised the issue with this House as a matter of public interest, which it clearly is. I am extremely concerned about the proposal for 55 years. It sounds like a Rip van Winkle story. What will the person be 55 years after the embryo has been created to the moment that the baby is born? There is an element of the unnatural about it and that concerns me very much.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09102150000003"></a>I have two main points to make. One concerns the medical implications. The first point, as the noble Earl said, is that it requires the opinion of only one medical practitioner, but as far as I can see it does not even need the medical practitioner to see the person who is said to be prematurely infertile. All that is required is a written opinion, which can be done on the papers. That is a very unsatisfactory method. One has to ask whether there has been any animal research on keeping gametes or embryos to see what they are like after 55 years, or even after 40 years. I suspect that the problem is not only in the freezing but the thawing. What will be the position when the embryo or gamete&#151;particularly the embryo&#151;is thawed as late as 40, 45 or 50 years on? We are in uncharted territory. As the noble Earl said, we have moved from five to 10 to 55 years in one go. One might have thought that we would move from 10 to 20, or even to 30, but we have moved to 55 without the medical knowledge. Very distinguished doctors, many of whom are in this House say that they do not know that there is very much difference between 10, 20 or 55 years, but if I may respectfully say so, they do not know. No one has been born after 55 years so the medical problems may be very serious, and it will be after the lifetime of quite a number of Members of this House.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09102150000004"></a>The other thing is the practical considerations. I had the misfortune to try an extremely sad case when couples A and B had their gametes switched. Two children who turned out not to be white were born to an all-white family because they had the gametes of Mr B who came from an ethnic minority. They were twins so six people were damaged: the white family with non-white twins; the black family who never had any children; and the children themselves who were mixed race in a family who adored them but found it difficult to come to terms with what had happened.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09102150000005"></a>Those were mistakes that happened on the day that the families went to the clinic. What sort of tracking will we have over anything up to 55 years? There will not be the same personnel in the clinics and the opportunities for mistakes and for not being as efficient as might be expected stand out. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, who is not here at the moment was particularly anxious that I should raise those two

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09102150000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, is as concerned as I am about the practical as well as the medical considerations. To move from 10 years to 55 is not proportionate to the need to store. There are human rights implications for those who are unlucky enough to be unable to have children themselves, to be able to store perhaps for their own future or that of their daughters or, possibly, sons. But there should be a proportionate limit on how long this should be for families who have the right to respect for family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09102150000009"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, there are a considerable number of loopholes in the proposals for saviour siblings, which I shall not go into as I would waste the time of the House. As only one of the couple needs to be prematurely infertile, one could easily be 40, 45 or 50 and the other might be considerably older. Although the clinic will give advice as to suitability, it does not have the right to say that the couple who wish to have the child are unsuitable because of age. That is another very difficult matter. I do not think that the sympathy one has for the unhappiness, distress and unfairness of life that some people are unable to have children should be allowed necessarily to sway the other situation on whether 55 years is right. This is a very unsatisfactory increase and I hope that the Minister will reconsider whether this is the appropriate way to go forward.</p>

It seemed reasonable that the 2008 Act should set down a period of 10 years as the maximum time embryos and gametes could remain in storage. Today we are being asked to change this&#151;not to 15, 30 or even 40 years, but to 55. That is a dramatic suggestion; it has all kinds of possible implications and it is very worrying that Parliament has spent no time considering the wisdom or rightness of it. Without today&#146;s action by my noble friend we would not be debating it, although perhaps a lifeline might have been thrown from elsewhere.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09102150000011"></a>There are many questions which need to be answered. It seems that the only reason that this step is being contemplated is because an eight year-old girl is suffering from Turner syndrome which, we are told, will render her infertile or might do so. I understand, and my noble friend Lord Howe has confirmed this today, that the figures for Turner syndrome are about one in 2,500, so the percentage of girls born with the condition is in the order of 0.05 per cent. In other words, only one out of every 2,500 girls has the condition. Are we changing the law on these grounds? No; it is fair to say that other diseases, such as cancer, can cause infertility, but I have no knowledge of what percentage of children are likely to get cancer at an early age.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09102150000012"></a>How can anyone say that the children who may suffer from these problems will, when they are older, want a child anyway? By no means every woman wants a child; many do not and, given the figures that came out today, some may be persuaded not to. In any case, the situation would not be a problem for 20 years or possibly more. The reason we are here tonight is that if the time for storing her mother&#146;s eggs were to be only 10 years, it would not be sufficient to allow the mother to become the daughter&#146;s donor. It is on that basis, I understand, that this proposal is before us.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09102150000013"></a>However, that cannot be said to be the end of the argument. Why does it have to be the mother who donates? There are hundreds, if not thousands, of women who have children today by IVF. There is obviously a steady supply of embryos and gametes without using old ones which have been in storage for so long that no one really knows how safe they are. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, whom I am delighted to see in his place, and whom we all admire for his work, is the acknowledged top expert in this field. He is on record as warning that there may be medical risks to the child if frozen eggs are used to make the embryo. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="09102150000069"></a>&#147;With regard to egg freezing, the situation is possibly much more serious. Very few animal studies have been done, and very few humans have been born&#151;I am not sure whether any of the children born are yet more than three or four years old&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102150000066"></a>I hasten to say that the noble Lord has made it clear that he would not ban egg freezing in the circumstances we are considering, but he is clear in his warning that there may well be risks to the child.</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09102150000014"></a>The question we face is whether this is wise or necessary. I still cannot see why it is necessary to elongate the storage period for so long. Surely an eight year-old would make up her mind on the matter before she is 63. Is it really sensible to encourage the birth of a child for whom its father is the father but whose mother is the grandmother and whose aunt is the woman who bore her?</p>

<a name="91021-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09102150000015"></a>Under the law today, all children have a right to know the details of their birth origins. Would it not be extremely puzzling, not to say worrying, for a child born from such an extraordinary mix of relations and ages to learn of that kind of background? It is the stuff of nightmares. This is far from a simple matter. Generations to come will want to know that we looked at all possible outcomes and discussed every reason and counter-reason for our actions today? We must not let them down.</p>

However, keeping eggs and sperm for 55 years seems a long time.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09102150000018"></a>The loopholes relating to extended storage include the fact that no age is given for the normal limit for childbearing, and therefore there is no line against which to measure &#147;prematurity&#148;. A full 10-year extension can be granted on the basis of the person being certified as prematurely infertile on any day within the existing 10-year storage period, and the medical practitioner does not have to certify that they will be prematurely fertile for the whole of the subsequent 10-year period. Only one of the persons whose gametes are used to make an embryo needs to be classified as prematurely infertile or likely to become so. The other person whose gametes made the embryo may be well beyond childbearing age but would still benefit from the extension granted to the partner. For example, a man could potentially be granted a 10-year extension in his sixties or seventies; his wife may be of a similar age but they could still potentially have a child, via surrogacy if necessary. A single medical practitioner simply has to give a written opinion that the person is prematurely infertile or likely to become so on the day they are examined; a full 10-year extension would then be given, subject to the 55-year maximum. The individual medical practitioner determines not only whether the person is infertile, but also prematurity. There are genuine differences of opinion in relation to normal childbearing age, particularly in regard to men.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09102150000019"></a>Treatment would then, in theory, be subject to the &#147;welfare of the child&#148; provision. However, considering that the regulations were drafted to allow young women to give birth to their half-sister or half-brother, where the grandmother would be the real mother, the welfare of the child provision seems rather meaningless. It is unlikely that it would be a sufficient safeguard in the case of elderly people being able to have children.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_771"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 771</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>indeed, by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, to whose excellent speech we have all just listened. In the interests of time, I shall not elaborate on or repeat what they have said, because we have only a short debate.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09102150000023"></a>The scrambling of the generations is a purely utilitarian approach to the problems of humanity. That is my first reason for disliking these regulations. My second, to which I shall speak a little more, is that they also have an equally utilitarian, nay almost casual, disregard for the later welfare of those who have been born in this way. There is absolutely no concern expressed&#151;not by the department, the Government or anyone else from officialdom&#151;for the welfare of these children, once they find out that the person they thought was their mother was also their half-sister, and that the person they have happily been calling Granny, they should actually have been calling Mummy. I do not think that has struck home at all, but it is true.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09102150000024"></a>There is, perhaps, an intention by the Government to prevent children born in this way, by regulation, learning about their background and from whence they have sprung. I am sure that the Minister will, with her characteristic openness, wish to say &#147;Yes&#148; or &#147;No&#148; to the Government&#146;s intentions about transparency, and whether they intend to move to prevent a child from knowing that they came as someone who has been born through scrambling of the generations.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09102150000025"></a>Also, the Minister cannot deny that the Government are making absolutely no provision to deal with the seemingly certain emotional distress for children, if they find out that they have been born in that way. I have tried to think about their psychological confusion. If I had suddenly found that out as a teenager, I would have fallen prey to it, just like that, and to the identity crises on stilts that would surely follow&#151;born, as they were, as the result of what seems to be a developing, full-on Eugenics Society policy from the Government.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09102150000026"></a>I have two points with which to conclude, in the interests of time. The Government seem to have given no thought whatever to what to do after creating an open door to the manufacture of genetic backgrounds. Those may indeed be within, first, hitherto legally prohibited degrees of relationship and, secondly, there is the possibility of unhealthy relationships developing within the family. I do not criticise the Minister, as I shall get straight answers to these points, but that is what these regulations do. I really would suggest, with respect to the Minister, that the Government should take these regulations away, think again, allow a proper public debate and bring them back to the House in a more seemly fashion.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09102150000028"></a>My first point is that nothing in this particular aspect of the legislation changes the possibility of  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_772"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 772</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>older women being treated. There is no specific area of guidance for that. It is still technically possible, and will be under law, to transfer a donated egg to a woman who is of a particular age unspecified in the Act of Parliament. That does not change, and it is actually a far more likely problem with in vitro fertilisation and might well be something that your Lordships would view with some alarm. The use of an egg which has been frozen for a long period under these circumstances would clearly be a much rarer event. It is not really likely that it would happen often; it might happen more often with sperm, because sperm are relatively easy to store and have certainly been stored for this length of time in the past.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09102150000029"></a>The issue of transgenerational embryos is a tricky one, and I understand and recognise the concern of a number of people who have spoken against such transfers. The problem is that we do not really have evidence&#151;although the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, made an impassioned speech on this&#151;that this is necessarily harmful to the welfare of the child, providing that there is no secrecy and that it is done with openness, as it has been in a number of parts of the world. For example, I believe that it was first done in South Africa some 10 or 15 years ago. There is an issue, then, about always keeping this kind of thing under surveillance, but again, that is quite possible without the storage of embryos or sperm. That can always happen, and the storage aspects are irrelevant to this, for they simply mean that you could do that for a longer time afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09102150000030"></a>The actual problem that we have to contemplate is one that we tried to deal with in discussing the Bill as it went though Parliament; that is, the issue of secrecy. Now, there is something of a misapprehension here about premature fertility. Your Lordships have, perhaps, forgotten that it is possible to be prematurely infertile at the age of six months. It is not just a question of Turner syndrome&#151;although, to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, I must say God forbid we should not have compassion for the rare cases that, like that syndrome, affect a few children, for they are as deserving of our compassion as anyone else. I accept that it is quite a rare event, but there are many other instances where a child will be made infertile, particularly by deliberate medical treatment.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09102150000031"></a>Increasingly, cancers are treated by heavy radiation or toxic drugs that destroy their gametes, and if those gametes can be stored at the age of two or three&#151;an ideal time biologically, as it turns out&#151;then that is what the 55-year limit protects. You might say that 55 years is a long time, but if you actually think about it logically it is not. Certainly, men of 55 are capable of having another child, and generally still consider that they might wish to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09102150000032"></a>We are now living at a time that is very different from even 20 years ago. A paper was published in the <I>Lancet</I> two weeks ago by Dr Christensen from Denmark. His paper is a beautiful piece of serious mathematics, which I do not think anybody doubts. It shows that, of the children born in the last decade, more than half will have a life expectancy of greater than 100. Our society is changing and people will work for much longer; it is inevitable. People will have quite different  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_773"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 773</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recreation. Many aspects of our society, including pensions, will have to change. It is quite feasible that women may wish to bear children, perfectly acceptably, a little later in life. It is possible, therefore, that this is something that the very occasional woman in her middle age might want to consider, though not necessarily at present.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09102150000033"></a>What this has done is simply to take a compassionate look at all possible opportunities, with wisdom to the future. It is clearly not going to be a common occurrence. British statistics tell us that very few women over the age of 50&#151;or even 45&#151;request treatment for infertility. There are a few. They are generally, of course, women who are taken very carefully through the process. I am surprised that your Lordships are concerned about the fact this should be a matter for just one doctor&#146;s opinion. That, to my mind, does not make sense. As far as I am aware, in legislation, the only times that we require two practitioners are, first, if we are committing somebody after 30 days because they are mentally unfit; and, secondly, for an abortion under the Abortion Act 1967. Medical treatments are not performed with multiple doctors taking decisions. I can say for certain that it is quite possible for five or six doctors who see a patient to misdiagnose premature infertility. I have seen it happen. Mistakes can always be made. Indeed, I have foolishly made that mistake from results after other doctors have made that comment, and then a patient has got pregnant.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09102150000034"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said; she said that this was unnatural. I do not wish to take issue with her because she is one of the wisest Members in the Chamber. However, I have to say that the whole procedure of in vitro fertilisation is unnatural. Taking an antibiotic is unnatural. Medical treatment is not natural. What we try to do with medical treatment is often a compromise; it is an attempt to find something that preserves and maintains the sanctity of life in whatever way we feel is appropriate. The noble Baroness also mentioned&#151;and I fear I have to disagree with her&#151;that there has been no animal research on embryo freezing. There has been, over a long period. Dr David Whittingham, who first froze embryos in the mouse over 30 years ago, regularly took tranches of embryos from that store every five years to examine the changes in them and then transfer them to the mouse uterus. Over 30 years he never found any change in their fertility.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09102150000035"></a>It is perfectly true, as the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, said, that I am concerned about the freezing of eggs. Indeed, I am quite concerned about the freezing of embryos. However, the evidence from my laboratory is nothing to do with long-term storage. Once in liquid nitrogen, the molecules hardly move at all. The changes are, on any scientific basis, bound to be very slight. There may be the most remote risk from background radiation, but Dr Whittingham&#146;s experiments did not show any such risk, which is something he tried to elicit. No, the problem with embryo freezing and the reason why I am concerned, particularly about egg freezing, is that the process that we use may cause epigenetic changes immediately in that gamete. That is something that we will have to explore and we need to continue to take under surveillance. This is something,

Any responsible medical society should try to improve the quality of follow-up to do that. That has not been part of the Act of Parliament, but maybe it is something that we should look at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09102150000036"></a>Furthermore, I am puzzled about introducing the issue of switching embryos. The noble Baroness mentioned the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. The switching of embryos can, of course, occur at any time, but I do not think that there is any evidence that the safeguards for long-term storage in proper laboratories, which are regulated by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, are likely to be at any greater risk at any time simply because storage is long-term and staff have changed. Staff change in many in vitro fertilisation units at yearly intervals.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09102150000037"></a>I have to take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Patten. The scientific community cares passionately about ethics. Indeed, if you look at the literature on the ethics of in vitro fertilisation, you will find that the majority of papers which take account of ethical issues have been published by practitioners in the field, often, but not always, after consultation with ethicists.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09102150000038"></a>Finally, even if we decide that longer-term storage is not possible, there is no doubt that there are a number of women who are requesting storage for longer than 10 years at the moment. I get e-mails&#151;very pathetic ones&#151;from women whom I no longer treat, but who have run out of time and whose circumstances would still be appropriate for having a child. Nobody here would doubt that. In cases of donor treatment, they sometimes want to have the same donor as a parent. That is not unreasonable; I know a number of patients who have wanted that. There is a risk that we might destroy that. Our biggest problem, and the concern that we should be addressing, is that when we start to have very punitive legislation, we have seen that, in practice, these patients go overseas. Once they do so, the very problem to which the noble Lord, Lord Patten, referred&#151;the question of secrecy&#151;is much more likely. In fact, if you prevent this practice, you will increase secrecy of parentage&#151;exactly what you do not want to see. I beg noble Lords to think about that if they decide to press a Division on this Motion, which I hope they will not do. Also, the other problem that we are very concerned about is that we know that when women and families go overseas, they are exploited and not cared for as well as they would be under the regulations which Parliament has so wisely enacted in this country.</p>

Having read what the noble Lord, Lord Winston, had said, there has, as far as I know, been no work done beyond 30 years. That was the point that I was making; I think I may have been misunderstood.</p>

I will be very quick indeed. I made some remarks, when these matters were considered previously, about the welfare of the child provision, particularly the importance of considering fathers in that respect. I seek some assurances from the Minister in respect of government policy on the importance of fatherhood in consideration of these matters.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09102150000041"></a>The right honourable Hilary Armstrong, when she was Minister for social exclusion, gave what many of us considered to be an absolutely outstanding speech on 29 June 2006, in which she outlined government policy. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="09102150000070"></a>&#147;But government can&#146;t do it all, and throughout my career I have seen the critical importance of good parenting. And fathers are as crucial as part of this as mothers. It is an obvious, but profoundly important statement that fathers have a key role to play in caring, loving, guiding and protecting their children. Research from the National Child Development Study has demonstrated that quality involvement&#151;fathers who read for their child, take interest in their education&#151;is closely linked with the absence of behavioural difficulties, greater academic motivation, and greater psychological resilience. The list of positive outcomes goes on and on. In short, fathers matter. And this is why fathers&#151;indeed all parents and caregivers&#151;must be considered as part of the vanguard in our drive against persistent social exclusion&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102150000067"></a>Furthermore, page 5 of the <I>Engaging Fathers</I> document produced by the Department for Children, Schools and Families states under the heading, &#147;Key research findings&#148;:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="09102150000071"></a>&#147;What are the gains for children of engaging fathers? Positive father involvement in their children&#146;s learning is associated with better educational, social and emotional outcomes for children, including: better examination results, better school attendance and behaviour, less criminality, higher quality of later relationships, better mental health&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102150000068"></a>Those are government statements of government policy in relation to this.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09102150000042"></a>The welfare of the child provision in the measure that we are discussing does not require clinics to consider the presence or existence of fathers or their active involvement in the welfare of their children. I seek assurances from the Minister that government policy in regard to the importance of fathers still obtains. If that is the case, does she consider that a further strengthening of the welfare element of these regulations is required in order to make that policy as explicit as other members of the Government have made it in the past?</p>

These matters are so important that it is vital that this House debates them extensively. Therefore, I welcome this evening&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09102150000044"></a>When I looked at these regulations for the first time a couple of weeks ago my initial reaction was that they raised a whole raft of new, very important ethical issues. Having studied them in detail and listened to tonight&#146;s debate, I am now not convinced that that is the case. I say that because when noble Lords started to debate the Bill that became the 2008 Act, we had a considerable number of debates about omissions from that Bill. That Bill amended the 1990 Act. The 2008 Act was criticised for not containing a sufficient basis  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_776"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 776</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of principle. However, the principles which the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, set down in her work back in 1990 endure and govern all decisions in this field; for example, that the welfare of the child should be paramount and the treatment of embryos should be of the highest order. I say that so that we do not take these regulations completely out of context, as I think there is a considerable danger that we might do that.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09102150000045"></a>I make that point because I listened to the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Patten and Lord Bates, with great care. Both of them raised important issues but those were extensively debated in this House during the passage of the 2008 Act. We discussed openness about donation and came to the conclusion, after considerable discussion, that that should be encouraged but that it is a decision best made by families. We debated the need for a father extensively and reached a conclusion with which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, disagrees, but none the less represented the view of this House and another place.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09102150000046"></a>This matter has become more important for reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with reproductive medicine but concern developments in other areas of science. For example, survival rates from childhood leukaemia are now considerably higher than they have ever been previously. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, talked about our ageing society. I have a further statistic, which I hope is as engaging as the one he mentioned. It is now reckoned that every day the average life expectancy of an individual increases by 15 minutes, so people are living longer and a considerable number of them will live very long lives. A life span that we now consider represents old age may, in the not too distant future, be viewed as representing middle age. That is the context in which we should consider these regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09102150000047"></a>I understand that when the regulations came before the Merits Committee, noble Lords asked whether records of donated gametes, embryos and donors were not more likely to be lost if the current 10-year period were extended to 55 years, as proposed. I note that the review period remains 10 years. That important fact may have been overlooked. Because of the ending of donor anonymity and the new provision for the creation of human admixed embryos for research, never for implantation in a woman, that was introduced in the 2008 Act, clinics, the HFEA and others are required to have much higher standards of record-keeping than has ever been the case previously. Individual practitioners and clinics face severe penalties if they fail in that regard.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09102150000048"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to intergenerational donation. Noble Lords will have seen the briefing from the Turner Syndrome Society and will have read about some of the cases. We are not talking about people who are being selfish as regards wishing that their children might have a family in due course. Many of those people are taking a very considered and thoughtful approach to the matter. The society cited the example of the lady who did not wish her daughter to be forced to contemplate becoming pregnant at the age of 18 or 19; she wanted her to be able to do that at a later stage, as other young women do when they enter settled relationships. I understand entirely  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_777"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 777</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the concern of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about confusion over identity. However, it is currently permissible for a woman to donate embryos or to be a surrogate for her sister. Many families do that because they wish to have children. There is not yet any evidence that the children born in those circumstances are any more confused about their identity than others because the relevant decision has been taken in a completely different atmosphere of openness and sensitivity than was the case in the past.</p>

<a name="91021-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09102150000049"></a>As regards removing the upper age limit, I understand entirely the concern that children could be born to old mothers. However, I believe that that issue was first discussed shortly after the birth of Louise Brown, who was born in Boundary Park Hospital, Oldham, and has been discussed ever since then. That is why I think there is no absolute cut-off limit. The matter should be kept under review and is one to which Parliament should return from time to time. We should not forget that the decision to allow somebody to have fertility treatment is always an individual clinical decision, which always includes an assessment of the welfare of the child who will be born as a result. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that there is a case for there to be more guidance but I do not believe that these regulations in themselves introduce sufficiently new and substantial ethical issues that they should not be passed by this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09102150000051"></a>These regulations allow for storage periods for embryos and gametes to be extended for longer than the 10 years set out in the 2008 Act. Storage can be extended for further 10-year periods if the person to be treated or the gamete provider is, or is likely to become, prematurely infertile. The maximum time period embryos or gametes can remain in storage is 55 years from the day they were first placed there. These regulations replace two previous sets of regulations&#151;one relating to extended storage periods for embryos and one relating to gametes. It was necessary to update the regulations to take account of changes in the 2008 Act and it was an opportunity to review the policy in this area.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09102150000052"></a>Two key changes are introduced by the regulations. The first significant change is to eligibility for extended storage. The regulations permit extension by the gamete provider or the person to be treated. The &#147;person to be treated&#148; is defined in the regulations as the woman to whom the gametes or embryos will be transferred or the person to whom they are allocated. Unlike the previous regulations, this now includes where donated gametes or embryos are to be used by someone who is, or is likely to become, prematurely infertile, and where a prematurely infertile woman needs to use a surrogate.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09102150000053"></a>These provisions will help real people in difficult circumstances, as outlined by my noble friend Lord Winston in his perceptive remarks. He knows about  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_778"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 778</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the tragic circumstances facing people to which I will refer later in my remarks. A situation was brought to the attention of Parliament during the debates on the 2008 Act in another place. A Member spoke on behalf of a constituent whose daughter suffers from Turner syndrome&#151;a genetic condition with symptoms including infertility&#151;who wishes to store her eggs for her daughter to use in later life. Without these regulations, extension beyond 10 years would not have been possible and storage would have expired before the daughter was of an age to make the choice about whether or not to use the eggs. These regulations rectify that situation, permitting storage where the intended recipient meets the necessary criteria, and providing them with the hope of having a child with genetic links to them. These regulations also provide for storage extension where a woman needs to use a surrogate&#151;for instance, because she does not have a womb. The additional storage period allowed in the regulations gives couples time to find and arrange a surrogacy without having to rush into an arrangement because the storage period is expiring.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09102150000054"></a>The second main policy change is to replace the age limit set out in the previous regulations with a maximum time period of 55 years. We recognise that there has to be a set storage limit and that any time period chosen inevitably involves an element of subjectivity. I hope I can explain why we decided on 55 years. The age limit of 55 years set out in the previous regulations was based on the upper age when a woman would no longer be able naturally to bear children. However, this meant that men who were prematurely infertile were prevented from extending storage beyond the age of 55, despite the fact that they were still prematurely infertile at that age&#151;for instance, after cancer treatment when they were younger. The age limit, therefore, was not sufficiently flexible to meet individual circumstances. The age limit has been replaced by a more equitable time limit of a maximum period of 55 years from the day the embryos or gametes were first put into storage. The limit of 55 years reflects the principle of trying to ensure that no one will be worse off under the new regulations than they were under the previous &#147;55 years of age&#148; rule&#151;in other words, to ensure that no one is disadvantaged by the new provisions. For example, the new provisions enable a woman to put her eggs in storage for her prematurely infertile infant daughter to use when she is older, and they enable the woman to do so for up to 55 years, subject, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, to confirmation by a doctor every 10 years that the daughter remains prematurely infertile. It is important to remember that storage can be extended only for 10-year periods and it requires a registered medical practitioner to certify that the person to be treated is prematurely infertile. Once a person is no longer prematurely infertile, no further extension of storage is possible. At each 10-year extension, a registered medical practitioner will be required to provide a statement that the person to be treated is still prematurely infertile. This change maintains a maximum limit while allowing clinical discretion to be exercised in relation to a specific patient.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09102150000055"></a>I understand the concerns expressed about the well-being of children born to older parents. These regulations do not encourage conception after the natural child-bearing age. It is only people who are prematurely

Once a person ceases to be prematurely infertile&#151;and, in a woman&#146;s case, becomes naturally infertile&#151;they would not be able to extend storage of their embryos or gametes. Each application for extended storage is considered on a case-by-case basis with a registered medical practitioner deciding whether, based on their clinical judgment, that person is prematurely infertile. A further safeguard is that, before treatment can be undertaken, there is a legal duty on the clinic to consider the welfare of the child. This House has had many discussions about what the welfare of the child involves and I hope to be able to offer some comfort to the noble Earl about what is going to happen next in that respect.</p>

These factors include taking a medical and social history from the patient and their partner and considering any circumstances where any child born may experience serious physical or psychological harm or circumstances that may lead to an inability to care for the child. The clinic also has a duty to offer counselling to those undergoing treatment. This gives patients the opportunity to discuss any concerns that they may have with a specialist counsellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09102150000060"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked about guidance on intergenerational donation. The HFEA is considering the issue and the guidance that it needs to provide for clinics. The Ethics and Law Advisory Committee of the HFEA is discussing issues around interfamilial donation, including intergenerational donation, and will recommend to the HFEA whether it should provide additional guidance. In fact, it discussed these issues at its meeting today. It will be making recommendations to the authority, which will discuss those at its December meeting. The noble Earl asked about the guidance provided on consanguinity. As I said, that is being discussed and we can expect guidance on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09102150000061"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and several other noble Lords asked how premature infertility is assessed. My noble friend Lord Winston gave a much more adequate answer than I probably could. It is assessed on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to include an exhaustive list of qualifying conditions. The HFEA provides guidance on when storage can be extended, listing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, for example. The extension should remain a clinical

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09102150000062"></a>The noble Earl asked why there had not been debate about the storage regulations. The 2008 Act was subject to extensive scrutiny in this House and debate by Parliament. Parliament did not deem it necessary for these regulations to be subject to the affirmative procedure. The storage regulations are subject to the negative procedure and were not required to be debated. Parliament did not deem that to be necessary, for some of the reasons outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, when the 1990 Act was passed and a draft of these regulations was approved by both Houses.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09102150000063"></a>I hope that I have given some insight into why the period of 55 years was chosen. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is right that this is, to an extent, subjective, but I hope that we have given an explanation. We have gone to the limits of what we think may be necessary. If we had chosen a shorter period, we might have found ourselves back here in a year&#146;s time because we had not covered all the eventualities and had disadvantaged people.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09102150000064"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, also asked about the number of people affected by storage extension. The extension of storage is a rare occurrence, as most people find the 10-year period quite adequate. A case study of an NHS clinic showed that approximately 5 per cent of people with gametes or embryos in storage extend that storage currently. The Government estimate an increase of perhaps 50 per cent&#151;that is 900 people&#151;under the new regulations. This is taking into account the additional circumstances for which storage can be extended&#151;for example, for teenage cancer patients and Turner syndrome patients. We estimate that only a few will need a further 10-year extension beyond the 20th year of storage.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09102150000065"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked what a clinic should ask itself in assessing the welfare of the child and whether age should be considered. The clinic will assess the welfare of the child in accordance with the HFEA code of practice. This requires the clinic to consider the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting. While there is no absolute rule on age, each case would be considered on its facts and it would be reasonable for a clinic to take age into account before it took a decision.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09102153000001"></a>The noble Earl also asked why extended embryo storage should be allowed in saviour sibling cases. I remind noble Lords that the test here is whether the person who needs to use the embryo is prematurely infertile, not whether the embryo is being created with the intention of being a saviour sibling.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09102153000002"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, asked whether it was safe to store embryos for this period, and about the evidence. The exchange of information between her and my noble friend Lord Winston means that I need not go into detail about the safety of the storage of embryos. The noble and learned Baroness also asked about one medical practitioner being needed to certify premature infertility. My noble friend also answered that question much more adequately than I did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09102153000003"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and other noble Lords asked about incidents and accidents and the need for tracking. Clinics already have storage systems in place for persons up to 55 years of age. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, remarked on how much these must be improved and how safe they need to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09102153000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, asked about Turner syndrome and why it must be the mother who donates. Again, my noble friend Lord Winston answered that and talked about the need for compassion. We should recognise that the storage of the mother&#146;s embryos offers a choice to the child when she becomes a woman. She does not have to use the embryos, but this will offer her a choice. For some people, having a child who is genetically linked to them is extremely important. If science can offer them that opportunity, who are we to deny them?</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09102153000005"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, also asked about the number of children who develop cancer. It is estimated that 1,500 children under 15 are diagnosed with cancer every year. Because of improvements in cancer treatment, we are pleased that many more of them survive. Again, if science can offer them the opportunity to have children in later life, why would we wish to prevent that?</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09102153000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked about registered practitioners and premature infertility. A medical practitioner must certify that the person is, or is likely to become, prematurely infertile. If a practitioner considers that a person will only be temporarily infertile, that person will not meet the criteria of this order. If a person does not meet the criteria and then their position changes and their fertility is recovered within 10 years, the 10-yearly reassessment will ensure that the embryos are not stored any longer than they need to be.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09102153000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, also asked about older couples having a child by surrogacy. Embryos would remain in storage only if the gamete donor, the woman to be treated or the person to whom the embryo was allocated was, or was likely to become, prematurely infertile. In this case, it would be difficult to argue that either member of an elderly commissioning couple would be prematurely infertile, and therefore they would not be eligible under the regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09102153000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked whether there was a discussion among the general public. The regulations were subject to a 12-week public consultation, which ran from January to March of this year. One hundred and sixty-six comments on the regulations were received. They represented the views of a diverse mix of bodies: professional organisations, public interest groups and interested individuals. Meetings were also held with key stakeholders. The noble Lord also raised the issue of emotional distress caused to children born through intergenerational donation. Clinics must be satisfied that patients have the opportunity to receive counselling before treatment. They must consider the welfare of the child before providing treatment. If donation is involved, clinics must also provide patients with information about the importance of telling the child about the donation. When that is linked to the guidelines  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_782"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 782</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that are now being considered, I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied that these things are being considered.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09102153000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, also raised the issue of opening the door to previously prohibited relations. Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the prohibition of family relationships and incest relates to sexual acts, not to the genetic makeup of any resulting offspring. The regulations do not change the law relating to prohibited relationships. The same safeguards that have always been there remain. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, is famous in this Chamber for his concerns about the importance of families and fathers. The issue of fathers was extensively debated during the passage of the HFE Bill. The House passed provisions which require clinics to consider the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting before providing assisted conception. The policy ensures that all parents are valued.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09102153000010"></a>In summary, the key features of the storage regulations are that the same infertility criteria for extension apply irrespective of whether gametes or embryos are being stored; that storage of embryos and gametes can be extended beyond 10 years where one of the gamete providers or the person who is to be treated is or is likely to become prematurely infertile; that an extension can be permitted in cases where the embryo or gamete was donated to a person who had premature infertility, including where a surrogate would be used; and that any extension should be for successive 10-year periods, until a maximum period of 55 years, provided that the relevant consents are in place and the criteria of premature infertility continue to be fulfilled within every 10-year period.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09102153000011"></a>In conclusion, these regulations are very important to the people who need them. They permit embryos to remain in storage to ensure that there is adequate time for women or couples who are prematurely infertile to complete their families. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and I also express my gratitude to the Minister for her very full reply. I was encouraged by some of it and shall have to go away and read other parts of it. Like my noble friend Lady Knight, I was puzzled by one part of the noble Baroness&#146;s answer in relation to premature infertility. Surely the question of whether someone is or is not prematurely infertile turns not only on an assessment of that individual but also on what is considered to be the biological limit of fertility in the average person&#151;man or woman. I do not think that the Minister fully addressed that part of the issue; nor did she address the point that the regulations could technically permit a child to be born well beyond a woman&#146;s natural limit for child-bearing, because the final extension of a full 10 years could be granted when a woman was aged 53.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09102153000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said that these regulations do not in effect take us into new ethical territory. I beg to say to her that I believe they do because the extended storage of gametes and embryos for the purpose of donation or surrogacy was made expressly illegal under the 1991 and 1996 regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09102153000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Winston, to whom I listened with great care and respect, suggested that elderly parenthood does not really raise any ethical issues at all. Again, I respectfully disagree with that if that was his view. My sole reason for wanting to call this debate was to say that there are ethical issues here and that they need to be talked about and thought about, especially from the point of view of the child. All too often people talk about these things solely or mainly from the point of view of the infertile person. It is not a question of a lack of compassion but of looking at these matters in the round, and I was very encouraged to hear that the HFEA is indeed doing that and is actively considering issuing further guidance. I welcome that assurance.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09102153000015"></a>I suppose that I could not reasonably have hoped for a revised set of regulations to substitute for these but, at the very least, it will be good and positive if this debate sends a strong signal to the HFEA that the question of the child&#146;s welfare in the context of the issues raised this evening should be given a lot more careful thought. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

Amendment 32 is in keeping with the Government&#146;s desire to make investigations at post-mortem more relevant and helpful to the family of the deceased, as in paragraph 37 of the draft charter for the bereaved.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09102153000017"></a>At post-mortem, it is often possible to go beyond the needs of the coroner and to get information relevant to relatives&#146; future health. Currently, it is a criminal offence for a pathologist to undertake work to further examine tissues if the wishes of the relatives are not known at the time of the post-mortem. Indeed, it is illegal for the pathologist to remove small samples of tissue for further examination, irrespective of what he finds, even if the coroner is no longer involved.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_784"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 784</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09102153000018"></a>It is also important to remember that if the wishes of the relatives are known, such as that they want a post-mortem which is to the absolute minimum, a pathologist can satisfy the needs of the state and still meet some of the wishes of the relatives by modifying the way in which the post-mortem is undertaken. A clear example of that is if, in the body cavities, it is quite obvious that the cause of death is natural and what the cause of death is, it may not be necessary to undertake a full examination, including slicing the brain.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09102153000019"></a>The first report from the Human Tissue Authority revealed that post-mortems are being undertaken in complete ignorance of the wishes of the relatives, and it made recommendations. However, the second report shows that problems still persist and that the wishes of the relatives are still not known by the pathologist. Sadly, that is probably because the Human Tissue Authority cannot influence how coroners work.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09102153000020"></a>Some coroners try to get round that before a post-mortem by trying to gain permission from the relatives for the blocks and slides to be retained so that they form part of the medical record. One would think that that would be good, humane and ethical practice. Sadly, some coroners do not go to the effort of obtaining that additional consent. Amendment 33 is designed as an enabling provision so that the Human Tissue Act can have flexibility without any possibility of return to the post-mortem practices which led to the 2004 Act. It will allow it to be brought closer to the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09102153000021"></a>The present problems fall into two categories: first, the inability to provide work for the benefit of the state; and, secondly, the inability to provide work for the benefit of the deceased&#146;s relatives. For the benefit of the state there are three broad groups: the first is forensic research. Research into shaken baby syndrome currently demands consent from the person accused of murder. There is no alternative. Research intended to prevent severe miscarriages of justice is in fact prohibited by law.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09102153000022"></a>Secondly, when the cause of death of an infant is not ascertained, the death is classified as being due to sudden infant death syndrome. A small proportion of those are unnatural deaths, but the vast majority are likely to be due to infections or other processes which are not yet identified. If there is a second death in that family, it could be essential to be able to go back and refer to tissues because you may then show that there was an inadequate immune response, for instance, to infection, which had not previously been detected because some highly sophisticated techniques would need to be used to stain the tissues.</p>

<a name="91021-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09102153000023"></a>The third area where the needs of the state are not being met at the moment is public health. The classic example is research into hidden infections. There was a recent important investigation into new variant Creutzfeldt&#151;Jakob disease which planned to take a tiny sample from the spleen of each deceased person at post-mortem. The coroners perceived that obtaining consent was outside their remit so that important Department of Health-funded research folded and we have no idea what the true instance is of new variant CJD.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09102153000024"></a>The other area is work for the benefit of the relatives. That is best illustrated by sudden cardiac death in young adults, which is usually caused by a variety of cardiomyopathies, some of which are inherited. To sample the heart requires appropriate consent. Qualified consent, as in the Human Tissue Act, would cover only the DNA analysis, so to take a piece of tissue requires appropriate consent. The trouble is that if one person refuses consent, and they may well do in the trauma and turmoil of being immediately bereaved, all other relatives are denied the benefit as the heart cannot be examined further. When another family member dies suddenly, the tragedy is more than doubled. It is important to remember that some of these conditions are inherited as autosomal dominants, not autosomal recessives.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09102153000025"></a>I am sure that the Government will say that consent is at the heart of the Human Tissue Act, and I am completely in agreement with the principle of consent, but it must be truly informed consent so relatives who have done no wrong are better served and miscarriages of justice can be more easily detected in future. Consent and well-being are at the heart of these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has with great elegance and eloquence, as usual, conveyed some of the problems that have arisen out of legislation and regulations that came into being after a considerable emotional response by the community to certain events with which we are familiar. The difficulty is that sometimes when one reacts to things in legislation of a relatively straightforward nature, only later do the complexities become apparent. In order to address the needs of families who are emotionally concerned, particularly at times of death, regulations were put into place, and it has become apparent that they go against those families&#146; best interests and what they want.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09102153000027"></a>In the past, a pathologist, as part of his professional understanding and commitment to the work, the patient and his relatives, would normally have gone a little further in completing the post-mortem and finding out what happened and its implications. Now, that is forbidden; it is not possible to go ahead. Knowledge is set back, and it is knowledge that is of great interest for the families, particularly when it comes to genetic disorders. The case put forward by the noble Baroness merits a strong, positive response from the Government. I have no doubt that the Minister appreciates some of these subtleties and that it is not easy to put them in place. However, we do not visit the Coroners Act on a regular basis. It is done once in a lifetime. The problem is that during those 25 or 30 years, many other things change.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09102153000028"></a>That takes me to my Amendment 34. It is clear that not only for the convenience and satisfaction of the family, but also, I suspect, for economic reasons in order to make sure that post-mortem examinations  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_786"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 786</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can be done quickly and relatively cheaply, it is being suggested that rather than full post-mortems, partial post-mortems or particular kinds of examinations might be undertaken. They would be briefer and less expensive. Of course, with new technology, they may be extremely helpful, and the technology will continue to develop over the next 20 years or so. The problem is that if a partial post- mortem is requested, it will be conducted by a medical practitioner&#151;in many, if not all, cases a forensic pathologist&#151;who will understand that each finding must be related to the findings in the body as a whole.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09102153000029"></a>However, the Bill implies&#151;indeed, it rather clearly states&#151;that a particular kind of examination that is not a partial or full post-mortem but perhaps a radiological or other less intrusive examination can be ordered by someone who may not be medically qualified. Indeed, a lot of these specialist examinations are increasingly being undertaken by people who are not medical practitioners, whether those examinations are haematological, biochemical, neurophysiological or histopathological.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09102153000030"></a>The problem is that that person, with their expertise, can come up with a perfectly accurate answer for the particular thing that they are asked to look at, but a coroner is not medically qualified and does not have the training, background or understanding of the body as a whole. Moreover, he requests a test to be conducted by someone who does not have that understanding, which is why this amendment asks that the coroner should consult a medical examiner. Perhaps other medically qualified people could be consulted&#151;I do not have my mind closed to that&#151;but the idea that it should not be someone with a medical understanding is a serious error and is likely to lead to misjudgments and serious mistakes in the conduct of these examinations and therefore to the wrong result from the inquest.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09102153000031"></a>I was not clear from the Minister&#146;s last response why there will be such a problem of delay. The main force of that response was that to insist that the coroner consults the medical examiner would occasion such delay as to be of great disadvantage to the family. It is unlikely that a medical examiner would be so unavailable that he could not be consulted. However, if there are other ways in which this problem can be satisfied, I look forward to what the Minister has to say in response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09102153000034"></a>I am greatly benefited by a letter, which the noble Baroness shared with me, from Professor Peter Furness, President of the Royal College of Pathologists. We must now look to the Minister to outline how the Government intend to respond to these situations, and how we can create the necessary flexibility to solve the most important of these problems while maintaining an appropriate level of scrutiny that would satisfy this House&#151;and of course the public&#151;that the underlying intent of the Human Tissue Act 2004 is not being undermined or eroded. We therefore await the Minister&#146;s response with great interest.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Alderdice, have said that this is a difficult, complex and subtle area. Because the level of subtlety is such that we need to write in response to this debate, I will end by inviting the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment and inviting noble Lords not to press their amendments. In those circumstances, I understand that it would be appropriate for amendments to be brought back at Third Reading if we were unable to satisfy the general direction that we have talked about. I will, of course, add that caveat about the spirit.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09102155000002"></a>We have once again returned to the emotive issue of post-mortems and tissue retention and, as in Committee, we have heard a number of highly informed opinions. I am confident that most if not all of the issues raised in Amendment 32 can be more than adequately dealt with in other ways. These include guidance issued by the Chief Coroner, the provisions of the Charter for Bereaved Families and provision in regulations to be made under Clause 38(3)(g) governing the preservation, retention, release or disposal of bodies, including body parts.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09102155000003"></a>I would wholeheartedly agree that, as a matter of best practice, it may well be appropriate for the coroner to attempt to explain and discuss the extent and purpose of any post-mortem examination before the examination is commissioned and carried out. Among other things the coroner would explain what would happen to any tissues taken as samples after the coroner&#146;s jurisdiction over them has finished. However, such prior contact with the next of kin may not always be appropriate or practical, particularly in situations where the next of kin cannot be immediately contacted, where the death is especially complicated or distressing, or in situations where the next of kin may be implicated in the death. It may also be the case that the coroner is not best placed to ascertain the wishes of the family. It is often the case that either a medical professional or a police officer is liaising with the family in the immediate aftermath of a death and they would be best placed to raise this issue.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_788"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 788</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09102155000004"></a>The draft Charter for Bereaved Families, published alongside the Bill, already contains relevant passages at paragraphs 15 to 20, 36 and 37, and we will consult further on this as part of the implementation process. In addition, I should say that the concept of &#147;appropriate consent&#148; is predicated on who gives the consent rather than on to whom the consent is given, so any such consent given to a coroner or to a coroner&#146;s officer, police officer or medical practitioner is already regarded as appropriate consent under the Human Tissue Act 2004.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09102155000005"></a>The 1984 coroners&#146; rules, which were updated in 2005 following the passage of the Human Tissue Act, contain provisions on material retained after a post-mortem examination. The coroner is required to inform the deceased&#146;s relatives of the period that material will be retained and the options regarding the material at the end of that period. One of those options is that the relatives may consent to the material being retained and used for medical research. Similar provisions could be made in regulations under Clause 38(3)(g) and we consider that this would be preferable to ascertaining wishes before the post-mortem when the family may be distressed and treating those wishes as consent.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09102155000006"></a>As regards Amendment 33, I must reiterate the Government&#146;s position that the regime set up by the Human Tissue Act 2004 is a consent-based regime and that the consent of the next of kin should be obtained in all circumstances before human tissue samples are kept for the purpose of scientific research, including those samples taken during a coroner&#146;s post-mortem. The Government cannot give their backing to any proposal that seeks to undermine the fundamental principle of next of kin consent established by Parliament in passing the Human Tissue Act. Therefore, once the coroner has finished his or her investigation and their jurisdiction is at an end, and if there is no requirement for tissue to be kept for evidential purposes, the state has no right to retain tissue without appropriate consent from the next of kin.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09102155000007"></a>I appreciate that it is a long-standing contention of bodies such as the Royal College of Pathologists that it is desirable that tissue be retained when it is for the good of the family; for example, when there is a genetic element to a cause of death. But the Government take the view that it is ultimately for the family to decide what is in their interests, and not for the state to dictate that their relative&#146;s tissue should be retained &#147;for their own good&#148;. The current legislation allows such tissue to be retained for these purposes with appropriate consent, and we wish that to retain that position. I can offer the noble Baroness some comfort with regard to paragraph (b) of Amendment 33 in that, under PACE, powers already exist for tissue to be seized as evidence and retained for criminal justice purposes.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09102155000008"></a>The provision at paragraph (c) regarding,</p>
<ul><a name="09102155000035"></a>&#147;any other matters as the Secretary of State may instruct&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09102155000023"></a>would provide the Secretary of State with wide-ranging powers to take away decisions about the retention of tissue from families, without even the safeguard of the requirement for parliamentary approval for such a change in the law. This would again contravene the spirit of the Human Tissue Act which has at its heart the concept that it is for individuals and their families  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_789"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 789</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to have the right to decide what happens to their bodies after they are dead. I am sure that organisations such as those representing the families affected by Alder Hey, Bristol and other organ retention scandals in the past would be very concerned at any attempt to weaken this principle. Also deeply concerned would be those who belong to many faith groups, who believe strongly that a funeral should take place with the body of the deceased person untampered with as far as possible.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09102155000009"></a>I hope that I have been able at least to satisfy the noble Baroness that her first amendment is unnecessary. I know that she will not be satisfied with my response to her second amendment, but I hope that she will agree that it raises an important point of principle which goes to the heart of the Human Tissue Act and, as such, this is not the occasion to take the matter further. I repeat that we will look at her speech with great care, consider its general thrust and write to her as soon as is reasonably practical. We will copy that letter to other noble Lords who have taken part in the debate.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09102155000010"></a>Finally, on Amendment 34, I reiterate that we anticipate that guidance about post-mortems issued by the Chief Coroner, in conjunction with and on the advice of the medical adviser to the Chief Coroner, would address the circumstances in which a non-invasive post-mortem might be appropriate and those cases which might warrant a kind of post-mortem plus. This might be, for example, when family members have concerns about a possible congenital defect, which a routine post-mortem may not reveal, if one or more family members die at an unexpectedly young age. Provided that the family consent, there is no reason why such a post-mortem cannot be held&#151;they could even be contacted by phone while the post-mortem is taking place.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09102155000011"></a>It is expected that the new medical examiners, whose primary responsibility is to confirm the cause of death entered by doctors on medical certificates, will indeed make important contributions to that decision-making process in the following situations. The first is where a coroner may be unsure as to whether a post-mortem, or related scientific examination, is required in a particular case. In that circumstance, the coroner will be able to consult the local medical examiner for advice, in the same way that he or she may consult the medical examiner about other issues which relate to the deceased person&#146;s medical cause of death. Alternatively, a medical examiner may refer one of their own cases to a coroner because, after consulting the treating doctor, he or she is unable to confirm the cause of death given on the death certificate.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09102155000012"></a>In making the referral, the medical examiner may make a suggestion about a particular kind of scientific examination which may assist, or may be consulted by the coroner about the sort of examination that the medical examiner would recommend. On the coroner&#146;s involvement in research projects, to which the noble Baroness referred, this is a matter that will be dealt with by the Chief Coroner in the future. We envisage that his approach will be more constructive than some individual coroners in the current system. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there needs to be  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_790"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 790</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a close working partnership between coroners and medical examiners. The difficulty I have with his amendment is that it would place in primary legislation a statutory requirement for the coroner to consult a medical examiner in all situations where a partial post-mortem examination or a particular kind of examination was being requested. I believe that such an approach would be unnecessarily rigid and could lead to delays in arranging post-mortem examinations, which could in turn lead to delays for families in making funeral arrangements. I hope we can agree that such delays would be undesirable and that, accordingly, it would be better to leave such matters to the discretion of the coroner.</p>

<a name="91021-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09102155000013"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for the time that she has spent with us both today and beforehand. We shall of course be available for further consultation after we have written to her. On that basis, I invite her to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09102155000015"></a>I simply repeat that consent must be at the heart of processes, but I should like to go one stage further and say that we must make sure that it is truly informed consent for it to be valid. That means recognising that, in acute bereavement, people are sometimes in such a state of shock that they really cannot give true, informed consent. CRY, an organisation that deals with sudden death, knows of families where consent forms have been sitting on the kitchen table for up to two years before they could even face tackling them. That is the extent to which people are traumatised. I am most grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage, but may return to it.</p>

It will be for the Secretary of State for Health to agree the detailed job description of the national medical examiner. However, it is envisaged that the national medical examiner will also act as the main point of liaison with the medical adviser to the Chief Coroner to ensure that close working relationships between coroners and medical examiners at local level are also mirrored at national level.</p>

He told me that the high-level forecast of the cost of introducing short death certificates indicated costs in the order of &#163;130,000, which would

So the expense is not great&#151;I inform my friends to my left, noble Lords on the Conservative Benches&#151;and it is not a new concept to have short death certificates.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09102156000004"></a>The Government stated their intention to introduce them in their 2002 report, <I>Civil Registration: Vital Change: Birth, Marriage and Death Registration in the 21st Century</I>. In that report, they said that the revised arrangements for access to registration information meant that there would be a certificate that omitted the cause of death. The document mentioned that the short death certificates were a particularly popular idea among respondents to the public consultation and had been advocated by the British Medical Association since 1995.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09102156000005"></a>It is important that there is an accurate record of the cause of death and that that be kept, for all sorts of purposes. But it is important to remember the position of bereaved people. There may be reasons why people would not want to share their relative&#146;s medical cause of death. Perhaps the person died of a hereditary disease, or the death may be sensitive, such as suicide, the consequence of drug addiction or alcoholism. For understandable reasons, the family may not wish to disclose these matters to others. A vast number of companies require a death certificate when they are notified of a termination, for example of a bank account. In some circumstances, when informing an insurance company, it is obviously important to give the cause of death, but telling banks, utility companies and other financial services that a person has died does not require telling them why. Ethically the obligation of confidentiality extends beyond the patient&#146;s death.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09102156000006"></a>There is a balance to be struck between society&#146;s need for accurate data, which can be used for statistics and so on, and the duty of confidentiality owed to deceased people and the bereaved. Those are the circumstances that lie behind this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment is about the death registration system, and would oblige the Lord Chancellor to make provision in regulations for short death certificates. I fully understand the reasons for this amendment. The cause of death of a loved one is a private matter unless it is clearly necessary for an organisation, such as an insurance company, to have that information. I can well understand that its unwarranted disclosure can cause the bereaved family unnecessary hurt.</p>

But we need to prioritise the reforms to the death registration system. Our priority in this Bill is to address the deficiencies in the current arrangements for scrutinising deaths identified by the Shipman inquiry. Implementing the reforms in the Bill will be a major undertaking. The introduction of a short death certificate would require changes to

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09102156000009"></a>The difficulty that I have with the wording of this amendment is that it places an absolute duty on the Lord Chancellor to make regulations. As an aside, it is worth pointing out that the regulations should properly be made by the Registrar-General. We need some flexibility to allow us properly to sequence reforms to the death certification arrangements. If the noble Lord would agree to withdraw his amendment, I will see what I can do about bringing forward an appropriately worded amendment at Third Reading that would confer a power to introduce a short death certificate, but afford some greater flexibility as to the timing. Of course, it will be open to the noble Lord to reintroduce his amendment at Third Reading if he is not satisfied. I hope on that basis that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09102156000012"></a>When the Ministry of Justice issued its coroner briefing system note in January this year, it said that the Government were committed to improving the system and reforms would introduce national leadership to ensure greater consistency between areas. Paragraph 15 of the Explanatory Notes states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="09102156000049"></a>&#147;The purpose of the Bill is to establish more effective, transparent and responsive justice and coroner services for victims, witnesses, bereaved families and the wider public&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_795"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 795</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09102156000041"></a>The reference to &#147;effective, transparent and responsive&#148; caused me some concern. Looking at the history, the post-Shipman inquiries initiated by the Home Office in 2004 have already been mentioned. At that time, the Home Office brought forward proposals to create a new unified coroner and death certificate agency, which would work out of local offices but be centrally financed and managed. It would replace local authorities in the appointment and support of coroners. It appeared at that time that the Home Office was aiming at something more centralised.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09102156000013"></a>However, between 2004 and 2006, responsibility passed to the Ministry of Justice, where a rethink was carried out and, instead of the centrally-financed agency envisaged by the Home Office, it stated that coroners would continue to be appointed and supported by local authorities. This prompted a sharply critical report from the Constitutional Affairs Committee, particularly on the Government&#146;s retreat from the centralised agency. This led to another rethink and to this Bill, which is really a hybrid because, if you like, it establishes a national service with local delivery. It will provide for a new national leadership but local authorities will still appoint and support coroners. I have wondered about this because, frankly, a hybrid never works as well as something which is centrally directed and run.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09102156000014"></a>My next port of call was to look at the rather inadequate impact statement which came with the Bill. In that there were four options, two of which were dismissed. Option three, which is the one we have before us&#151;the enhanced service locally based&#151;lists a summary of savings and benefits, including greater rights for bereaved people, improvements in case handling, more effective handling of cross-district major emergencies and greater accountability through inspection arrangements. There is nothing very significant in that. However, option four&#151;the unified national service&#151; includes all those savings and benefits and adds effective introduction and enforcement of good practice, common standards for the public, a charter for bereaved people and a complaints/appeals process, leadership and public accountability; it would enable comprehensive co-ordinated forward planning, resource management and efficiency savings; it would provide a single career structure for coroners and staff and allow for management of personnel; there would be a single system of medical expertise to support the service; and it would allow streamlining and modernising of investigations and inquests for greater efficiency and with more focus on bereaved people. In other words, the Government acknowledged that a unified national service actually met all the aims they were trying to achieve and which, I suggest, was far better than anything else that had been suggested before.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09102156000015"></a>Along with a number of other people I wondered how I could suggest when we were considering the Bill that we should not accept option three just because it is the recommended option but should look seriously at option four because we are considering, for the first time for 130 years, the reform of something fundamental. I was very interested to find that among my supporters was the Local Government Association, which believes that the coroner service should be a national service under the control of the Ministry of Justice; that councils should not be expected to manage a service  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_796"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 796</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where the national standards are established and monitored by the Chief Coroner; where coroners can be removed from office only by the Lord Chancellor; and where they have no control over costs. If the Local Government Association, representing those people who are meant to be supporting and accommodating the service, is uneasy, we ought at least to raise this matter during the debate rather than let it go by default.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09102156000016"></a>I also found that Mr Tom Luce, who was responsible for the first inquiry initiated by the Home Office, says that he was one of those who would have preferred a new, centralised structure as the best solution&#151;or, at least, that support of the coroners service should have been transferred to the Courts Service, which already exists. The service would then be completely independent of the public service&#146;s responsibility for the facilities in which deaths occur, while a national agency or other centralised arrangement should be able to equalise standards and practices between different areas.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09102156000017"></a>If the coroners service was transferred to the Courts Service, it would be under the aegis of the Lord Chancellor or of the Secretary of State for Justice. I then looked at the Bill again, to see whether in fact such a service would be directed by the Lord Chancellor, and provision for that is already effectively made. Clause 22, with Schedule 2, allows,</p>
<ul><a name="09102156000050"></a>&#147;England and Wales to be divided into coroner areas and gives the Lord Chancellor the power to set and alter the boundaries of these areas ... after consultation with the relevant local authorities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09102156000042"></a>while Part 4 of Schedule 3,</p>
<ul><a name="09102156000051"></a>&#147;makes provision for the relevant authority for the area to pay salaries to senior coroners ... The amount of these ... fees is for the ... coroner and the relevant authority to agree. If they fail to reach an agreement the matter can be referred to the Lord Chancellor&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102156000043"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s court inspections are carried out by an agency that reports to the Lord Chancellor, so everything is already in place for what would seem a logical outcome with better impact, without having to go too far.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09102156000018"></a>However, one has to consider the coroners themselves. I consulted one senior coroner who had always felt that coroners were in a difficult and hybrid position, because they were not part of the court system as a whole. He also commented that, unlike the remainder of the court service, coroners do not get a pension until they have been coroners for 40 years, which makes life pretty difficult for somebody who is appointed one at age 50. He also pointed out that, currently, being funded by local authorities meant a postcode lottery&#151;because some authorities were less supportive than others&#151;and that different coroners being paid different salaries by different local authorities was thoroughly unsatisfactory. Like other coroners, he is concerned about the clout that the Chief Coroner would have without funding.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09102156000019"></a>Finally&#151;and this was the most important part of all&#151;he mentioned the fact that were they part of the Courts Service, they would have access to all of its facilities, the courts and other support. That would be a major factor in reducing delay, which is one of the prime objects of the Bill. Of course, it is not surprising that the Government have shied away from something which has the centralisation of responsibility and is  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_797"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column 797</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>financing a system that probably requires more cost, certainly to the Courts Service. Neither is it surprising that there will be those in the court system&#151;the judicial system, and others&#151;who are concerned that that system is already under strain, and therefore not in a position to provide resources to the coroners to help them in their task.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09102156000020"></a>However, my purpose in tabling this amendment now is because in a Bill of such magnitude, it is unfortunate that the one issue being ducked is whether, rather than a hybrid being presented as the answer, and with all the problems associated with that, the House should not have considered the other option; that is, of going for what is clearly the best solution in efficiency of outcome. While being absolutely open and clear that there are limitations to this, which must be borne in mind, it is therefore probably not the right time to press this any further than a discussion, with the suggestion that, perhaps having also discussed the matter with the Ministers, we might reconsider the matter at Third Reading. I beg to move.</p>

It is an odd thing that the Ministry of Justice and its predecessors have been engaged in bringing all the different groups of those who are either judges, tribunal chairmen or judicial officers under one roof. The Leggatt reforms and the legislation passed by this House not so long ago have meant that tribunal chairmen now become judges. The tribunals right across the country which were not part of the Courts Service are now part of the Courts Service. The magistrates were a separate service; they are now, partly at least, run by the Courts Service. I believe I am right in saying that the only group of judicial officers with judicial functions who are sitting in a situation similar to a judge&#151;except that their work is inquisitorial rather than largely adversarial&#151;are not under the Courts Service. As far as I know, there is no other group of judicial officers that is not in the Courts Service.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09102156000022"></a>There are obviously practical reasons why the Government do not want to do it. Presumably it would cost more money, but I know from personal experience that when there are very big inquests the Government foot the bill anyway. I would have thought that it was not beyond the wit of the Government&#151;particularly the Ministry of Justice&#151;to think of the importance of having all judges, all tribunal chairmen, all magistrates and all coroners operating under the same system. It would be a great advantage for the coroners. It would give them and their Chief Coroner added clout, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said. It would also be a very tidy way of dealing with every aspect of the judicial work that goes on in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09102156000024"></a>In north Wales, we had for a period a full-time north Wales coroner. I think, although I am not sure, that there are now two&#151;one for north-east Wales and one for north-west Wales. There are some eight local government organisations and, of course, they are subject to the Welsh Assembly. Local government is devolved, so we have a position in my part of the world whereby the coroner is selected, paid, controlled, disciplined and so on by the Lord Chancellor&#146;s department, but is also paid for by a devolved organisation. I do not know how they split it, but it is an extraordinary muddle. The only reason for this can be that the Ministry of Justice simply does not want to take on the expense of court buildings. However, magistrates&#146; courts are closed all over the place. There are plenty of buildings and plenty of empty courts today in the Crown Court, as I am told. Certainly, in north Wales there are ample opportunities for a proper coroner service to be given to the people.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09102156000027"></a>The noble Lord made his case very well. Much of what he said has merit and his ideas are certainly worth considering. There are practical and logistical reasons for a merger. I know from speaking to coroners that they are concerned about pressures of space. Managing to get hold of a suitable venue can be troublesome. No doubt, the Minister will comment on that. Coroners have to take the courtrooms they can get. Many of the services, experts and facilities on which they draw are the same as those used by the Courts Service. But&#151;from our point of view, this is a very big &#147;but&#148;, and I think the noble Lord knows that we cannot fully support his proposals&#151;we believe that one of the strengths of the coronial system, which is unique in many ways, is its independence. We value a service that is renowned for its tireless investigation into the cause of deaths and its deep well of practice and expertise established over many centuries. Speaking as a good Conservative, I think that is worth preserving, and I would not want to make the change for the sake of it.</p>

However, there is a nice irony about this debate&#151;I am very grateful to the noble Lord for initiating it&#151;namely, that a Government who have been falsely accused of centralist tendencies will defend localism and a local response as opposed to showing centralist tendencies.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09102156000031"></a>The amendments would make Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, rather than local authorities, responsible for coroner areas and appointments. In other words, they would make coroners part of a national organisation, and move away from the model of central leadership with local delivery that the Bill proposes. Our thinking on this issue has developed in a certain way. Following the reports of Tom Luce and Dame Janet Smith in 2003, we explored the option of a national coroner organisation in great detail. However, we were not persuaded that a centrally funded and operated service would significantly improve the coroners service and people&#146;s experience of it. The Bill instead preserves the existing locally delivered and funded service but strengthens it through the introduction of national leadership and national standards.</p>

<a name="91021-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09102156000032"></a>The cost of a national organisation, whether part of the Courts Service or a separate entity, would be disproportionate to the benefits it would bring, and perhaps even unaffordable. As the impact assessment published alongside the Bill shows&#151;I do not think it is one that impressed the noble Lord particularly&#151;we estimate that a national organisation would cost three times more than our proposed model. The approximate figures are &#163;10 million additional funding for running costs under the Bill&#146;s scheme and at least &#163;30 million additional funding for a more centralist model. The other argument is that the nationalised structure would take years to set up. We hope that our model will take only two to three years. Joking apart, it would also be out of step with the Government&#146;s moves in recent years towards bringing services closer to the local communities which they serve.</p>

<a name="91021-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09102156000033"></a>We believe that the approach in the Bill is a better and more proportionate way forward. There will be a new national framework with leadership and guidance from the Chief Coroner, and we will retain local delivery with coroners and local authorities working together at a local level to ensure a high quality service to bereaved families. The Chief Coroner will set national standards for all coroners and their staff in England and Wales, and will monitor compliance with those standards, oversee the services for families set out in the charter for the bereaved, and issue guidance on particular issues. We believe that the appointment of a Chief Coroner will make a significant difference over time. At the moment there are 110 coroners and, frankly, 110 different ways of doing things&#151;some

We want more of the former and less of the latter. Local authorities will continue to fund the coroner system and provide accommodation, staff and other resources, and police authorities will continue to provide coroners&#146; officers in the majority of jurisdictions to ensure that services are tailored to any particular local needs.</p>

<a name="91021-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09102156000034"></a>To confirm what my noble friend Lord Davies said in Committee on 9 June, if it seems that any particular coroner area is underfunded or that any coroner is using resources inefficiently, the Chief Coroner will step in to liaise between coroner and authority to improve the situation. Provision and use of resources will be looked at additionally by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Court Administration. We hope this will help to facilitate a consistency of service delivery across coroner areas while ensuring that coroners continue to be able to make independent decisions about individual cases.</p>

<a name="91021-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09102156000035"></a>Having said all that, we naturally wish to keep the impact of our reforms of this system under review. They will need time to bed down and we must not rush to judgment. I do not rule out taking a fresh look in a few years&#146; time at how we best organise the service. The Chief Coroner will undoubtedly have a view on this, as will the Justice Select Committee of another place, which will want to examine the impact of our reforms as part of the now normal process of post-legislative scrutiny. In future there may be a stronger case for integrating coroners into the Courts Service, but given the long gestation period for the provisions in the Bill, that is a question for another day.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Welsh Ministers (Transfer of Functions) (No. 2) Order 2009.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09102143000003"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09102143000188"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> With the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to the draft Government of Wales Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications, Transitional Provisions and Saving) Order 2009. This draft order for Welsh Ministers would transfer a range of functions relating to building standards from  UK Government Ministers to Welsh Ministers. In particular, it would transfer the power to make  building regulations for Wales. The proposed transfer of functions has the approval and support of the Departments for Communities and Local Government, Energy and Climate Change, and Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000004"></a>The draft order transfers to Welsh Ministers functions of the Secretary of State under the Building Act 1984 and associated legislation. These include the function of making building regulations that set functional performance requirements for building work. Building regulations address a range of health, safety and sustainability issues including structural stability, fire protection, resistance to moisture and contamination, energy and energy efficiency, ventilation, combustion and accessibility. The 1984 Act also confers functions on the Secretary of State in relation to the administration of the regulations, and imposes a duty to establish and maintain a Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) for England and Wales to advise on changes to the regulations.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09102143000005"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09102143000189"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend. With regard to the building regulations provisions in paragraph 9, is there to be a payment of any kind made to members? What are the terms and conditions of appointment, and are the committee positions in Wales to be advertised?</p>

<p><a name="09102143000006"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09102143000190"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I think I am grateful to my noble friend for notice of his questions. I will respond to them later when I hope to be able to respond to other contributions to the debate. I hope that he will bide a little time before we get to that stage.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000007"></a>Some functions under the 1984 Act relating to appeals and determinations have already been transferred to Welsh Ministers. The proposed transfer will include all of the Secretary of State&#146;s remaining functions under the 1984 Act and related secondary legislation, with a small number of specific exceptions. For example, functions are not transferred in relation to energy infrastructure buildings, except where planning functions are already devolved or where the buildings are not used to carry out an energy function&#151;for example, houses or office buildings on the site of a power station. It will be recognised by the Committee that energy is not a devolved matter.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000008"></a>Although energy infrastructure buildings are exempt from the building regulations, this exemption will come to an end if and when Section 5 of the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004 is brought into force. When that happens, the power to set construction standards for those buildings should remain with UK Government Ministers.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000009"></a>The order will also transfer functions under the amended regulations made in 2000 in respect of energy performance certificates, but only in relation to certificates which are required on the construction or alteration of buildings. As I have mentioned, the 1984 Act requires the Secretary of State to appoint a Building Regulations Advisory Committee and consult the committee before making certain building regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000010"></a>It is appropriate that Welsh Ministers, when they propose to exercise the power to make building regulations for Wales, should receive advice from a committee with specific knowledge and expertise relating to Wales. The draft order therefore provides for the BRAC to be replaced by separate committees&#151;for England and for Wales. In addition to functions under the 1984 Act and regulations, the order will transfer reporting functions under two other Acts.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000011"></a>Section 6 of the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004 requires the Secretary of State to report on the building stock in England and Wales every two years, covering changes to building regulations and matters relating to energy efficiency, emissions, on-site energy generation and recycling. Section 14 of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 provides for reports on steps which the Secretary of State has taken to secure greater compliance with environmental requirements of building regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000012"></a>The transfer of these reporting functions is wholly consistent with the transfer of functions under the Building Act and with the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s policies and strategies relating to climate change and waste.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000013"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have sought the devolution of building regulations as a key element in achieving its climate change and sustainable development objectives in Wales. They have begun a process of informal engagement with the public and industry, but a significant amount of work remains to be done in respect of the development of changes to the energy efficiency requirements of the regulations. The period before the order comes into force in 2011 will ensure that Wales benefits from the changes to those requirements which the UK Government propose for 2010, and give the Welsh Assembly Government the opportunity to further develop their proposals and engage with the industry in Wales.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000014"></a>Welsh Ministers have given an assurance that they intend to continue with the current building control system and to develop changes only in respect of energy efficiency in the first two years. Welsh Ministers have further confirmed support for the UK Government&#146;s proposals for reform of the building control system, the implementation of which may fall to Wales to implement after the transfer. There will be no budgetary transfer from the UK Government to the Welsh Consolidated Fund when the executive functions concerned transfer. The full costs of devolution in this case will be borne by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000015"></a>The post-transfer financial consequences external to government of any proposed changes to the building regulations will be considered through regulatory impact assessment, in accordance with the statutory code of practice required under Section 76 of the Government of Wales Act. Any proposals for changes to the regulations will also be subject to consultation, in accordance with the requirements of the Building Act.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000016"></a>The proposed transfer of building regulations functions would complement existing devolved planning and development control functions enabling the Welsh Ministers to exercise more coherent policy control over the development process, through the stages of planning, design and construction. Delivering sustainability in the built environment increasingly relies on a co-ordinated approach, taking into account matters of location, site arrangement and detailed design.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000017"></a>The draft Government of Wales Act 2006 order recognises that the legal separation of the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Assembly Government under the Government of Wales Act 2006 has required a large number of consequential modifications to other enactments. This order makes further consequential modifications to three Acts and related revocations, transitional and saving provisions. Part 2 of the order deals with modifications to British nationality legislation; Part 3 deals with modifications to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the Companies Act 2006.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000018"></a>On Part 2, Articles 3 to 6 relate to Section 2(1)(b) of the British Nationality Act 1981. This provides for a child who is born overseas to a British citizen serving overseas in Crown service, or in closely associated service which has been designated by order of the Secretary of State under Section 2(3) of that Act, to be a British citizen. The present designation order is the British Citizenship (Designated Service) Order 2006.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000019"></a>In the case of Crown service, provided that either parent is serving overseas in Crown service under the Government of the United Kingdom and was recruited for that service in the UK, their child will be at birth a British citizen. In effect, for British citizenship purposes, that means that the child will be treated as if it was born in the UK.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000020"></a>The Government of Wales Act 2006 has established the Crown in right of the Welsh Assembly Government as a separate emanation of the Crown. Article 3 modifies the definition in Section 50 to include service under the Welsh Assembly Government as Crown service.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000021"></a>If the order is made, service with the Welsh Assembly Government overseas will henceforth be Crown service under the Government of the United Kingdom on a par with service with the other emanations of the Crown in the United Kingdom. Consequently, Articles 4 and 5 make appropriate revocations in respect of the 2006 and 2008 orders. Article 6 makes related transitional provision to deal with children born overseas to a member of staff of the Welsh Assembly Government during the period from 25 May 2007, when the Welsh Assembly Government came into being, until 14 February 2008, when the 2008 designation order came into force.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000022"></a>The effect of that transitional provision is that for such a child&#146;s British citizenship, the service overseas of the parent with the Welsh Assembly Government is treated as if it had been Crown service under the Government of the UK. That means that the child will become a British citizen otherwise than by descent rather than, as at present, a British citizen by descent.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000023"></a>Article 6 also makes a saving provision in respect of children born between 14 February 2008 and the date that the order comes into force. In that case, the effect is to ensure that the status of that child as a British citizen is unaffected by the revocation of the 2008 order. Such a child will continue to be a British citizen otherwise than by descent. Inquiries have revealed that there are three children covered by the transitional provision and four children by the saving.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000024"></a>Turning to Part 3, Article 7 modifies<b></b>Section 41 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Section 41 provides for the relationship of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom with other courts in the UK. In particular, it provides that decisions of the Supreme Court on a devolution matter coming before it are not binding upon the Supreme Court itself but are otherwise binding in all legal proceedings. The modification to the definition of devolution matters means that it now covers proceedings before the new Supreme Court in respect of the new legislative powers of the National Assembly for Wales.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000025"></a>Articles 8 to 12 make modifications to a number of provisions in the Companies Act 2006. Sections 54 and 1193 of the Companies Act 2006 place restrictions on companies and businesses adopting names that suggest a connection with branches of government.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000026"></a>Articles 9 and 11 amend respectively Sections 54 and 1193 to include reference to the Welsh Assembly Government alongside the existing references to Her Majesty&#146;s Government and others, the effect of which is that companies and businesses cannot adopt names which suggest a connection with any of those bodies

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000027"></a>Sections 54 and 1193, which came into force on 1 October, replaced provision previously contained in Section 26(2)(a) of the Companies Act 1985 and Section 2(1)(a) of the Business Names Act 1985. The Government of Wales Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications and Transitional Provisions) Order 2007 modified those Acts so that the Welsh Assembly Government were treated for the purposes of those provisions the same as Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the Scottish Administration. This instrument ensures that Sections 54 and 1193 of the Companies Act 2006 include the Welsh Assembly Government as well as Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the other devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000028"></a>The Companies Act 2006 and Limited Liability Partnerships (Transitional Provisions and Savings) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made on 9 September, contained a saving for the provisions in the Companies Act 1985 and the Business Names Act 1985 that applied in respect of the Welsh Assembly Government. That saving will now cease to have effect. Articles 10 and 12 modify respectively Sections 482 and 1231 of the Companies Act 2006. Those sections contain references to the Government of Wales Act 1998 that now need to refer to corresponding references in the Government of Wales Act 2006.</p>

Articles 10 and 12 of the order modify respectively Sections 482 and 1231 of the Companies Act 2006. Those sections contain references to the Government of Wales Act 1998, which now of course need to refer to the corresponding references in the Government of Wales Act 2006. In addition, Article 12(3) requires the First Minister for Wales to lay before the National Assembly a copy of each report received from the independent supervisor of the Auditors General. That requirement will not apply to calendar years before 2010. It is, however, appropriate, following the Government of Wales Act 2006, that the consequential modifications to the three Acts should be made. I commend the orders to the House and beg to move the first one.</p>

If I understand it correctly, they largely involve building regulations. I have spent a lot of my life&#151;probably about 30 years of it&#151;involved in and around building regulations, so I suppose that I must declare an interest, having worked for Redland as a buildings materials producer and then been a director of the NHBC.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000031"></a>The purpose of the order is, as the Minister said, to transfer to the Welsh Ministers functions currently exercised by the Secretary of State under the Building Act 1984 and associated legislation. The Explanatory  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Memorandum indicates that the purpose of the proposed transfer is to help to advance the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s policies to tackle climate change. The Assembly Government intend to pursue even more stringent carbon reduction targets than those applicable in the rest of the country, and aim to achieve that by, inter alia, reducing still further the environmental impact of the building industry&#151;a brave objective. To help to advance that policy, the Assembly Government consider it necessary to develop their own building regulations&#151;another brave challenge.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000032"></a>Although the pursuit of policy to tackle climate change is of course laudable, I am concerned that the creation of a different building regulations regime in Wales from that of England may have a severe impact on both the Welsh construction industry and Welsh house buyers. It appears self-evident that complying with more stringent building regulations will inevitably lead to greater costs on the building industry, which is at present already suffering grievously in Wales. Indeed, Redrow Homes, Wales's largest house building company, recently posted its worst ever set of results.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000033"></a>The housing market in Wales is very fragile. It must be a concern that any additional costs that fall on house builders and are passed on to house buyers will have the effect of further depressing the market. At a time when the goal of increasing the supply of affordable housing is being pursued, it is hard to see that any proposal that has the effect of increasing the cost of houses will do anything to allay what is a serious problem, especially in rural Wales.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000034"></a>It is a concern that, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, no impact assessment has been undertaken. The Minister will no doubt respond by saying that that matter should be left to the Assembly Government to conduct during the pre-measure stage. However, I note from the memorandum that engagement with industry and other stakeholders over potential changes to the regulations in Wales has actually begun. What initial responses have been received from the industry so far? Is it the case, as anecdotal evidence has it, that the response of the building industry to date has been wholly adverse? What do the Government propose to do to address the concerns of the industry? What initial assessment have the Government made about the likely additional cost to the industry of complying with the kind of regulations that are foreseen as a consequence of the Assembly Government&#146;s policy?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000035"></a>What assessment have the Government made of the likely impact of more stringent regulations on house prices, the housing market generally and, perhaps most important of all, the availability of affordable housing? What assessment have they made of the likely impact of the availability of mortgages? Do the Government recognise that with more stringent building regulations in place in Wales than in England there will be a significant incentive to Welsh builders to move their operations out of the Principality into England, which in the most populous parts of Wales is less than an hour down the road? What consideration have the Government given to the potential of more stringent regulations deterring English builders from pursuing building operations in Wales?</p>

<p><a name="09102143000036"></a>The order provides for a commencement date of 31 December 2011, which according to the Explanatory Memorandum is intended to provide a lead-in period for the establishment of Welsh Assembly Government capacity for the transfer of functions and development and engagement work in respect of the first proposed changes to the building regulations. How satisfied is the Minister that the Welsh Assembly Government are able to build such additional capacity in time for the commencement date?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000037"></a>The order provides for the establishment of a building regulation advisory committee for Wales and a separate committee for England. What assessment has been made of the effect of such separation on the capacity of the committee for England? What are the implications of such a separation? On costs generally, is it intended that any and all additional costs generated by the new Welsh regime will be absorbed by the Assembly out of the existing budget? As the Minister will gather from my questions, we on this side of the Committee have serious reservations about this proposal. Having spent a lifetime involved with building regulations, I would also like to know how long it took to reproduce the building regulations from Northern Ireland, which were completed about five years ago. There are also separate building regulations for Scotland, so we should know how long it took for them to be produced. At least the Scots have the advantage of being a long way away from the main building of England. From where I stand, I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will have a little more thought about passing this burden&#151;and I believe that it is a burden&#151;to the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000038"></a>The second order seems to be largely technical and administrative and a tidying-up exercise. I have no particular comments to add to the Minister&#146;s explanation of it.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000039"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09102143000193"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, in contrast, this order is welcome, given that it transfers building standards functions from the Secretary of State to Welsh Ministers. It enables the power to make building regulations and create a Welsh advisory committee. Given the National Assembly&#146;s commitment to sustainability required by the Government of Wales Act 1998, the order is especially important, because it transfers functions under the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004 and the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000040"></a>The functions within these Acts will assist Welsh Ministers to meet the carbon-reduction targets of climate-change policies for Wales. The Climate Change Commission for Wales and a promised 3 per cent per annum carbon-reduction target in operation by 2011 will be drivers to achieve objectives for the buildings defined in the order. What distresses me is the time that it has taken to obtain this order to transfer functions&#151;from 29 November 2007 to enactment by the end of 2011. This is an enormous length of time to get a simple piece of legislation through the parliamentary and Assembly procedures. It proves that the clumsy bureaucratic process of transferring functions in the Government of Wales Act 2006 is far too slow, and the sooner that more primary legislative powers are transferred to the Assembly, the better.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000041"></a>Part 4 of the 2006 Act needs to be enacted as soon as possible, and a referendum needs to be brought forward, to give the Assembly the new powers. I agree with the opposition Front Bench that the affordability and impact of the regulation need to be examined. However, in my experience in Wales, building companies from the other side of Offa&#146;s Dyke tend to build a lot of executive houses that local people cannot afford. This is not necessarily the disaster that the opposition Front Bench is promulgating.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000042"></a>The second order makes changes consequential to the Government of Wales Act 2006. I agree that this contains a much simpler series of technical amendments relating to Acts of Parliament&#151;three in this case. The impact of the 2006 Act on separation of powers from the Assembly and UK Government to the Executive and Welsh Ministers is a desirable reform. The Secretary of State may make modification orders to enactments as he considers appropriate, as a result of the Government of Wales Act 2006. This is a tidying-up exercise. As the Minister said, the modifying enactments are the British Nationality Act 1981, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the Companies Act 2006. The changes are all consequential on the Government of Wales Act 2006, but there is a drip-feed of gradual transferral.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000043"></a>Paragraph 7.3 in the Explanatory Memorandum stresses:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000161"></a>&#147;Most of the executive functions of the old Assembly became functions of the Welsh Ministers&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09102143000157"></a>and it sets out the process consequential to the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000044"></a>The new Assembly now has legislative powers to pass Assembly measures for the Executive, who are the Ministers, to have Executive powers. My party agrees with that, but it is a terribly slow process towards giving the Assembly full legislative powers, and we could spend time better ensuring that the Assembly gets those powers as soon as practicable.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000045"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09102143000194"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> My Lords, I certainly welcome the content of the two orders that we are now considering. In many respects, both involve what might be described as consequential developments. In the case of the second order, it clearly deals mechanically with matters which arise from the passing of the Government of Wales Act 2006. It is worth noting that although that Act received Royal Assent on 26 July 2006, we are now in the third tranche of consequential amendments. The Act itself, a rather bulky piece of legislation, contains dozens if not more consequential amendments. In 2007, there was a very substantial clutch, again dealt with by way of regulation, and now we are in the third tranche. If I was of a mischievous disposition, I would ask the Minister whether he can give an undertaking signed, as it were, in his heart&#146;s blood, that there will be no further tranches but, not being of that disposition, I allow that to remain as a wholly rhetorical question.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000046"></a>One must note the difficulty when one is dealing with a process of devolution that started in 1964 and which has gone on piecemeal, dealing with hundreds of small items, some of them of impact, others are very little impact. I regard them almost as a cloud of  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confetti. It is very difficult to count each and every one and try to place it in its exact sequence. That is why I&#151;and, I suspect, one or two others in this House&#151;would welcome a transfer of functions on a general basis, with a short schedule of matters which are excepted and not transferred. When that happy day will come, we know not, but that would take away a great deal of the pain, anguish and frustration inherent in the present system.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000047"></a>Turning to the first order, which deals with the question of building regulations, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, with his usual force and dynamism, has made a powerful case, but it is not a case against the regulations, it is a case against Welsh devolution in general. We have a devolution settlement which confers on the Welsh Assembly, a democratically elected body with certain substantial powers, the right to ask this House to allow it to be distinctive in areas which have been well delineated since 1964. However, if you then say, &#147;Except in relation to anything where Wales might in fact take a different line from that of England, and where we assume that there is a Welsh border that distinguishes between what happens to the east and to the west&#148;, you will have made devolution a nonsense. You will have negated the whole purpose of devolution. I say that with the utmost respect, which I feel for the noble Lord. The case that he is making is an anti-devolution case rather than an anti-regulation case.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000048"></a>As for the consequentiality&#151;if there is such a word in the English language&#151;of the provisions, into their creative merits they are to a large extent consequential on the events that took place many years ago. They are mainly based on the Building Act of 1984. Most of the administrative and legislative provisions of that Act were devolved to Wales a long time ago. All that is happening now is that a few gaps are being filled in. If there were a general case, it would have been decided a long time ago, so this is consequential on decisions that have been laid down and established.</p>
<h5><a name="09102143000174"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000049"></a>The powers in fact mean that Welsh Ministers will be able to take a more holistic, creative view of the whole situation. They will have greater flexibility and be able to look at safety, for instance, side by side with carbon reduction. Regulations in Wales may well be of a standard marginally higher than those in England&#151;in theory, it could be marginally lower because there is no stipulation that it must be higher. We know not what the 2010 regulations will be in England, but they will take precedence. Whatever the situation, the building regulations will allow a distinctive Welsh approach to be taken to building. They will allow the Welsh Assembly to show whether it can live up to its undertaking of a 3 per cent carbon reduction by 2011, and a much more flexible and integrated approach to the problems. To deny the Assembly that would be to deny the very basis of devolution. For that reason, I welcome the order.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000050"></a>As regards cost, I doubt whether the point made by the noble Lord is valid. There will obviously be greater cost if you have a higher standard&#151;it is axiomatic. On the other hand, the market value of the produce you create will also be greater.</p>

However, it was at such a remote time in the past that I had better describe it as being in the 80s. Wales had its special housing problems then, as now.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000052"></a>Obviously, a great deal of detailed work has gone into the preparation of these orders. Those of us who have studied them and the accompanying memorandum are appreciative of the clarity of these documents. I have few comments. I want to deal first with the order which gives to Welsh Ministers functions relating to building and building standards. What is being done and why is well set out in the Explanatory Memorandum. We are told that it is a consequence of the one-nation agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru parties which support the present Welsh Assembly Government. That agreement provided for the Climate Change Commission for Wales and a carbon reduction target of 3 per cent from 2011 in devolved areas of government. In turn, that development requires the appointment of separate building regulations advisory committees for England and Wales in place of the single advisory committee currently covering both countries.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000053"></a>I want to concentrate on the duplication of these committees and the bureaucracy that goes with them without any apparent real need or supporting public demand. We are told that the impact on the public sector will not be significant and that there will be no budgetary transfer from the UK Government to the Welsh Consolidated Fund. That may be so, but we are facing a period of severe public spending restraint, whatever happens at the next general election, and we must be mindful of the latent costs of duplications of this kind and question the need for them whenever they are proposed. Where they are proposed, as in this case, can the Government ensure that there is maximum co-operation between what are very similar committees for England and Wales with similar functions in order to avoid needless duplication of effort, staff and expense.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000054"></a>I am concerned about the points made by my noble friend Lord Glentoran relating to how more stringent regulations may possibly result in increased costs to builders and, indeed, to building purchasers. This will not be welcome to Welsh people if it occurs, and with due respect, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, was somewhat unfair in accusing my noble friend of making an anti-devolution point. I really think that with all his building experience, he was talking about the cost impact of more stringent conditions.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000055"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09102143000196"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I have high and warm regard for the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and I would like to make it clear that in no way did I insinuate that he was seeking to avoid the issue and trying to attack devolution in toto. What I said was that his criticism&#151;fundamentally, that any discretion given to the Welsh authority in relation to any field to apply a standard higher or lower than that of England has its problems&#151;is something that is essentially an argument not against the particular regulations before us, but against devolution itself. It was in that context that I put the argument.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000057"></a>I shall move on to the second order dealing with consequential modifications. It is a reflection of the new split in Welsh devolution between the legislative Assembly and the Executive in the form of the Welsh Assembly Government, as explained in paragraph 4.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum. Those of us who welcomed that development as a step away from a local government to a central government model of devolution will welcome this order in principle, and I am happy to do so. The proposed modification to the British Nationality Act 1981 to extend Crown service under the Government of the United Kingdom to Crown service under the Welsh Assembly Government seems to encapsulate the change made by the 2006 Act with regard to the status of those who serve the Assembly Government.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000058"></a>Some Assembly civil servants work overseas, as indicated in paragraph 11 of the Explanatory Memorandum. I am happy to hear that their families are successful and producing children, but while the modification proposed will certainly place the parents on an equal footing with those who serve the Scottish and Northern Ireland Administrations as well as those serving the United Kingdom Government, I hope fervently that those who are serving the Welsh Assembly Government will work closely with their United Kingdom counterparts locally wherever they may be because there are sometimes considerable benefits to be gained from collaborating and working together, rather than striking out independently.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000059"></a>That was certainly my experience over more than 15 years as a Minister in the old Welsh Office when we successfully attracted a great deal of inward investment to Wales with the assistance of colleagues in departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Trade and Industry. With my noble friend the Duke of Montrose sitting beside me, I am bound to say that on occasion I was very happy to represent Scotland, simply because there was not a Scot in sight. But I sought to do so in the knowledge that if there had been the Scottish Minister, he would have represented Wales in the absence of a Welsh Minister. Incidentally, I would be interested to know how many Welsh Assembly employees work overseas, what they do and where they work. It would also be interesting to know just how the Welsh numbers compare with those relating to Northern Ireland and the Scottish Administration, although I do not think that we will be given those numbers today.</p>

After 1979, I keenly followed the ministerial career of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. His was a distinguished contribution and, my word, it seemed he was there for ever. That is a compliment, not a criticism. Indeed, I was ignominiously thrown out of office in 1979 and  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, took my place he took every advantage&#151;and that is not a criticism either. I recommend his memoir&#151;a very serious tome&#151;which was very well received in Wales.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000061"></a>In the Explanatory Memorandum, so kindly made available to the Committee, there is at paragraph 7.3 a reference to fire safety. There a coherent policy control is claimed for the regulations; for example, the integration of development and building controls. Can my noble friend make available now or later any detail concerning fire safety? How are our excellent fire authorities involved in Wales? Furthermore, paragraph 7.17 of the memorandum refers to public consultation. What details might be given on consultation? Are any details available at this time for the consideration of the Committee? How many thousands of people attended the consultation meeting in Penrhiwceiber in the south and how many hundreds from Llanfairfechan in the north? That is a rhetorical question, but I should like to know what consultation is taking place. I thank my noble friend the Minister for his opening remarks. As ever, I have no trouble in supporting these orders.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000062"></a>Finally, on a philosophical point, it is my opinion that the Welsh Assembly is on a certain course to acquire more powers. Arguably, that could be by evolution, as seems to be the case, or possibly on the big bang development, which may be the case in the medium term. I do not know which it will be.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000063"></a>All of us followed the decision of the Scottish Parliament to release a sick prisoner to enable him to return to Libya. The case brought a searching and continuing examination of British governance&#151;particularly the relationship between, in this instance, the Westminster and Edinburgh Parliaments. It has thus brought the claims of devolved government to the fore of parliamentarians&#146; considerations at a time when our major political parties are considering the contents of their general election manifestos. Shall they offer more devolved powers to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast? Does the Libyan experience enhance or diminish the case for more devolution to our Celtic nations?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000064"></a>I would be very surprised if the inner counsels of the London-based parties were not debating with policy makers where to go next on the devolution map. It is reasonable simply to raise that point as we consider these important documents. If the parties are not considering those issues, perhaps they should. The Edinburgh Parliament&#151;or, rather, the Government in the Edinburgh Parliament&#151;did not appear to give ground during the Libyan furore. The Scottish Government had their way. They did not budge. What happened there was seen and considered in some detail, I should think, in Cardiff and Belfast. Are there any implications for the Welsh Assembly?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000065"></a>I believe that the Welsh Assembly will continue to seek more powers. I would be astonished if it did not. My guess is that the London parties are likely to bid against each other to offer more devolved powers to the Celtic nations. I would be surprised if party manifestos did not bring forth more offers&#151;and the likelihood&#151;of more powers. I offer these remarks only to enable me,

This is a question of governance raised in the mother of Parliaments&#151;an ancient Parliament.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that the order relating to the building regulations involved some courage. I have always looked upon courage as being the first political virtue. After all, Sir Humphrey often said to the Minister that pursuing a policy would be courageous, when he meant that it would be downright daft. However, for politicians as a whole courage is what marks them out; that is how they get things done. I am not worried about the charge that courage is needed in this area&#151;although not to the extent that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, indicated.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000067"></a>However, I do not have the courage to engage again in the devolution debate. I heard what my noble friend Lord Jones said and I heard the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, but when we are talking about functions consequential upon devolved legislation&#151;which, with the best will in the world are points of detail which follow the logic of powers already devolved to Wales&#151;raising the whole issue of the principles of devolution is stretching this debate a bit far.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000068"></a>I heard what my noble friend Lord Jones said; I know how lyrical he can wax on these issues and how eloquent he can be, and I have no doubt that there will be a time when that eloquence is deployed in future on the broad principles of these issues. If the Committee will forgive me, though, I will not follow that up now, otherwise I will never get my job done today.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000069"></a>I am obliged to answer one or two questions. I do not think that the changes are quite as significant as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has indicated. To take the most obvious point, is it likely that the changes regarding the empowering of the Welsh Assembly in respect of building regulations will have a significant impact on Welsh house prices? I ask you, in the context of the credit crunch and the enormous shift in house prices over the past couple of years, are we going to say that house prices are going to be significantly affected by these aspects of the regulations? Of course, it will be for the Welsh Assembly to judge that. The noble Lord, coming as he does from a part of the country that enjoys aspects of devolved government too, must surely have trust in his fellow citizens.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000070"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government will have to make their judgments about additional costs, and they are likely to be extremely careful in the context of the difficulties facing the building industry at present. We cannot overestimate the challenges at the moment for the whole building industry, but that is true in England as well. I maintain that we must trust the Welsh Assembly Government to advance these regulations as they see fit in due course, while having proper regard to exactly the points that the noble Lord has indicated: potential additional costs on the building industry, and perhaps thereby, as he has suggested, a marginal advantage to people who build houses in England as opposed to Wales. That is for the Welsh Assembly Government to reach their decisions on; that is the whole point of devolution.  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We are not debating the principle of devolution here; all we are debating is the consequential impact of decisions already taken.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000071"></a>I hear what the noble Lord has said, but I am obliged to say that he is being somewhat oversolicitous about the issues in Wales. If he is making a general point, then any advances in building regulations that increase costs at present might be considered untimely. In so far as that point is valid, it will be registered in Wales as much as it will in England, Northern Ireland or Scotland&#151;in fact, anywhere in the United Kingdom. We must give due credit to our fellow legislators elsewhere to take account of these issues, but I am not of a mind to worry unduly about them. I think the noble Lord will accept that the Welsh Assembly will need to take this decision into account.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000072"></a>There is no doubt the Welsh Assembly may use their enhanced powers to improve the position of building in Wales to meet carbon targets. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, commended that, and so do I. After all, no one thinks that we are going to meet carbon targets without cost; if anyone does think so, they have not examined the debates about the whole issue of carbon targets and the challenges that face this nation in issues far beyond the question of housebuilding regulations, which are the subject of this order. We shall not always debate those potential costs, but while we know that we need to address our minds to those matters, to suggest that we might have doubts about these changes in empowering the Welsh Assembly Government in this narrow area because of the potential costs involved is straining the issues too far. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concerns and he is right to identify the challenges faced by the building industry at present. No one underestimates that. I say merely that when these powers are transferred to Welsh Ministers, it will be for them to make judgments on the matter in the same way as Ministers in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000073"></a>He also asked about consultation and whether participation in it has been extensive. I do not have the figures before me, but what is known is that it is not possible for effect to be given to this legislation without proper consultation and the Assembly Government are committed to that. When they bring in the regulations, consultation will take place.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000074"></a>I was also asked about the fact that we have divided the committee into one for England and one for Wales. There is now an opportunity for fruitful discourse between them. The intention would be for representatives to sit as observers on each other&#146;s committees so that there is an exchange of information. England will be responsible for its area, of course, and Wales for its own once these orders are given eventual effect, but there should be an understanding on both sides of the border&#151;given that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, emphasised how quick the transition can be from populous parts of Wales to England and, to a certain extent, vice versa&#151;that the two committees will have in attendance representatives from the other committee in order to see how these matters are being handled. I take on board the point that almost any aspect of Welsh affairs, taking into consideration the position so far as England is concerned, is bound to be of  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerable importance. So I accept the noble Lord&#146;s warning on that point and I want to give him a reassurance that we have a framework for it.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000075"></a>I turn now to the other points that were raised in the debate. I have some difficulty in avoiding getting involved in the bigger debate, but I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, who welcomed these orders as a step forward for the people of Wales in terms of their empowerment to consider these matters. The issue of climate change has to involve the whole nation of the United Kingdom as best we are able to effect. Central Government have to take their case to Copenhagen where we have big issues to confront which can be resolved only within forums with an international agenda. Actual effective action will also depend on maximum participation of our citizenry at every level and therefore developments that devolve responsibility to local areas, and certainly as an aspect of the devolution process so far as Wales is concerned, are surely to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000076"></a>I respect the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who has vast experience of these matters. He indicated that times they are a&#146;changing and therefore we face new challenges 20 years on from some of those he faced. However, I want to emphasise the point that effective co-ordination will take place. He also asked me about job specifications under the second of these orders. I do not have a detailed response for him, although I am prepared to write. He will recognise the limited numbers involved, but I did ask about the kind of work that these people are doing. Largely, it is that of promoting Wales overseas, so the work is related to business and tourism, thus mainly economic functions overseas on behalf of Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have the same facility, and while key representation is bound to be United Kingdom-wide, in certain areas where particular approaches may be fruitful, it is only right that the devolved nations are represented overseas, particularly as regards certain trade and industry matters and, for Wales, in terms of tourism.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000077"></a>The numbers are limited, which is why the number of children involved is likely to be small. That does not make it any more necessary; we want to ensure that the children of servants of the Welsh Assembly Government overseas enjoy the same rights as they would if they were children of people working on behalf of the Foreign Office or the Department for Business in our embassies overseas for the UK Government.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000078"></a>This has been a rather wider-ranging debate than I had anticipated, and I am well aware of the fact that I may not have answered all the general questions as effectively as I would have liked. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked me about certain aspects of fire safety; I will have to write to him about that.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000079"></a>The matters that we are considering today are a consequence of decisions that we have already taken with regard to devolved powers. Perhaps the wider debate on devolution, which is always an important one, ought to wait until another day.</p>

The water framework directive of 2000 envisaged a new groundwater directive to clarify the WFD&#146;s objectives for groundwater, and a new directive was agreed in 2006 to replace the 1980 groundwater directive. In the discussions on that directive, the UK aimed for simple, transparent measures to protect groundwater from pollution; locally determined risk-based standards and targeted monitoring; and to avoid measures that would be disproportionately costly compared with the environmental benefits achieved. I am pleased to report that potentially ineffective and costly EU-wide standards were, on the whole, avoided. The impact assessment indicated a cost-neutral outcome in relation to action already required under the directive. I hope that that is of some reassurance to the Committee about the nature and impact of these regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000081"></a>The 2006 directive adopts existing EU values for controls over nitrates and pesticides, and provides for member states to determine national groundwater standards, the way in which these should be used to assess groundwater body status, and the identification and reversal of pollution trends. These elements are being transposed separately as part of WFD implementation. The regulations before us today transpose Article 6 of the directive, which makes operational the WFD objective to prevent or limit the input of pollutants to groundwater, and distinguishes the substances whose input into groundwater is to be prevented from those to be limited. Sensible exemptions facilitate a practicable approach.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000082"></a>Currently, there are groundwater protection measures transposing the 1980 directive in the Water Resources Act 1991 and the 1998 groundwater regulations. The new  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations introduce no fundamental changes to groundwater protection. Nevertheless, it is necessary to amend the 1998 regulations to transpose Article 6 while respecting the provisions of the 1980 directive, which remains in force until December 2013.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000083"></a>Consultation on transposition was completed last summer. Responses indicated broad agreement with the proposed approach. The details of the regulations are as follows.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000084"></a>Regulation 1 deals with coming into force and regulation 2 updates definitions. In particular, a registration or disposal under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 will become a permit for groundwater purposes. The terms &#147;hazardous&#148; substances and &#147;non-hazardous&#148; pollutants effectively replace the list 1 and list 2 dangerous substances to be controlled.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000085"></a>Regulation 3 explains the meaning of &#147;hazardous substances&#148;&#151;essentially those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, and of which the existing prescriptive list 1 comprises a large subset. Member states must identify hazardous substances, and that will be the responsibility of the Environment Agency in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000086"></a>Regulation 4 provides that &#147;non-hazardous&#148; pollutants cover all other pollutants. These new terms potentially embrace a wider range of pollutants, but in practice the agency will identify additional substances where they are problematic.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000087"></a>Regulations 5 and 6 reflect the welcome fact that the 2006 directive provides for sensible exceptions, such as unavoidable accidents; exemptions from the need for a permit, such as very small inputs that would not affect groundwater quality; and inputs that cannot be prevented without risk to human health or which, for contaminated ground, would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000088"></a>Under the 2006 directive, disposals of radioactive substances and discharges from septic tanks are no longer exempt and so will now be subject to permitting under these regulations. The controls relating to both radioactive substances and discharges from septic tanks are expected to enter the environmental permitting regulations in 2010. In relation to discharges from septic tanks, the current exemption will be carried over in relation to discharges that amount to less than two cubic metres per day, but from 1 January 2012 it will be necessary to register with the environmental agencies such discharges, subject to basic rules of operation and maintenance.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000089"></a>Article 6 of the 2006 directive requires us to prevent the input into groundwater of hazardous substances and to limit the input into groundwater of non-hazardous substances to avoid pollution. Regulations 7, 8 and 9 put this into practice and Defra guidance will clarify what is meant by the requirement at regulation 8 to prevent the input of hazardous substances. This is an important objective but will not always be achievable. European Commission guidance explains that, in this context, prevention means taking all necessary and reasonable measures, where &#147;reasonable&#148; means technically feasible and without involving disproportionate cost. In other words, we must do whatever we can while recognising the inevitable limitations that apply to the concept of &#147;absolute prevention&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000090"></a>Regulation 10 sets out the circumstances where the agency may permit inputs of pollutants, given a range of practical considerations. These are valuable exemptions, offering greater flexibility than hitherto. Regulation 11 requires investigations and the technical precautions to ensure that the grant of a permit is made only in accordance with the requirements.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000091"></a>Under regulation 12, future reviews of permits will be carried out as necessary rather than on the current statutory four-yearly basis, and should therefore save resources. In practice, such reviews will normally follow the water framework directive&#146;s six-year review cycle for the publication of river basin management plans.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000092"></a>Regulation 13 carries over the offence of &#147;causing or knowingly permitting&#148; an unauthorised discharge, established in the 1991 Water Resources Act and the groundwater regulations 1998. As before, exceptions are made for highway drains&#151;there are too many to permit individually&#151;and for discharges of less than two cubic metres a day from septic tanks.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000093"></a>In both cases, the agency may serve a prohibition notice where problems arise. Regulation 14 carries over relevant defences. Regulations 15 and 16 provide for transfer and administration permits, including conditions, reasons for refusal and for appeals against refusal, variation or revocation of permits. Regulation 17 enables the agency to serve a notice requiring information, and regulation 18, similar to current powers, to prohibit an activity which might lead to the input of a pollutant to groundwater, with a right of appeal contained in regulation 19.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000094"></a>Regulation 20 carries over the provision in the 1998 groundwater regulations for Ministers to approve codes of good practice giving guidance on compliance with the regulations to be taken into account by the agency when serving a prohibition notice. Regulation 21 requires the agency to record details of permits on a public register. Regulations 22 to 24 update the standard penalties for offences and regulation 25 revokes the 1998 groundwater regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000095"></a>We intend to consult on draft guidance to the Environment Agency once the regulations are made. The regulations will be short-lived, in that they will be absorbed into the environmental permitting regulations in 2010. However, the transposition date for the 2006 directive means that these regulations are needed to bridge the gap.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000096"></a>In conclusion, I commend the groundwater regulations as a good example of successful EU negotiations contributing to good operational management, reflecting my department&#146;s approach to better regulation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000097"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102143000203"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations and going through them. I think that he shares my determination to use this brief debate to expand on the Government&#146;s reasons for their introduction. We on these Benches appreciate and understand that groundwater is an important resource. Its contamination is potentially very dangerous to human health, aquatic life, plant life and animal life. Damage to it is very difficult and costly to remedy.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000098"></a>I must declare my interest as a farmer and grower and start by asking what impact the regulations might have on livestock farmers, particularly the aspect of diffuse pollution, which may cover muck-spreading and slurry. My second interest is as someone living in the countryside, far away from mains sewerage and dependent on septic tank drainage. I am not alone, of course. How many dwellings in England and Wales have domestic septic tanks and how many have other types of domestic sewage treatment, similarly not connected to the mains sewerage? I am minded to think that the regulations would include mini-schemes covering small hamlets, clusters of houses and rural businesses, using schemes such as I have at home, a Clargester system for the pack house premises. Almost all those systems are linked to soakaways, which would see them included.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000099"></a>Why was the current exemption limit for domestic discharge set at two cubic metres per day? Does the new European groundwater directive specifically ban such discharges and remove the previous exemption, or is that the Government&#146;s interpretation? The major consequence of the regulations is that that exemption will be removed in due course. What is the current extent of groundwater pollution from domestic septic tanks discharging less than two cubic metres per day? Can that be characterised by location, frequency or the type of equipment used? What is the level of resultant damage?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000100"></a>I know that those are detailed questions, but they are of great interest to the large number of people who may well find themselves involved.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000101"></a>Does the Minister believe that any domestic sewage installations currently in use will be rendered unsuitable by the implementation of these new regulations? After all, some may be of proper interest to English Heritage. How many septic tanks or sewage plants will have to be replaced? What are the costs involved and who is picking up the bill?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000102"></a>The Environment Agency&#151;I refer here to a Written Answer given by the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, to a Question I tabled on 17 September&#151;has 20,000 discharge permits or input permits and groundwater extraction authorisations. How many permits is it estimated will be sought by the owners of domestic sewage systems when they are included, as now they will be? How will the agency ensure that householders in isolated dwellings that may require a permit will be given the information they need to make their decision? I note that a web-based system of registration is proposed, but what percentage of the households affected have access to the web? On what grounds will the Environment Agency be able to refuse to issue a permit to the owner of a domestic sewage system, and what will be the probable charge for a permit to use a septic tank? Will householders who pay to have septic tanks emptied need a permit each time? Will the web-based registration scheme for discharges from isolated dwellings be a record of all discharges or just a record of septic tank owners?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000103"></a>How does the Environment Agency discover that someone is discharging less than two cubic metres of effluent daily and how is it traced to its source? What are the agency&#146;s costs for enforcing this legislation?  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have the impact assessment, but has an independent evaluation been made of the cost burden that it will bear for bringing in daily discharges of less than two cubic metres from isolated dwellings? The impact assessment sought information on which groundwater policy would be reviewed to establish actual costs and benefit. It would be interesting to know whether this is going to be forthcoming, and if so, how frequently. I know that the Government propose to make all this part of a regular river basin management process, and while the long-promised floods and water management Bill&#151;I hope that we will see it in the forthcoming Queen&#146;s Speech&#151;will undoubtedly consider this aspect, the draft Bill makes no reference to these regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000104"></a>Taken as it stands, these regulations will have a huge effect and generate potentially considerable costs for UK householders and businesses alike. The Explanatory Memorandum talks of a light touch in their implementation, but I note that the punishment for failing to comply with them is a fine of up to &#163;50,000 or up to 12 months in prison for those who find themselves inadvertently caught within their scope after 1 January 2012, so no light touch there. Is this really a like-for-like interpretation of EU water regulations? I know from my French experience that my soakaway system has been examined and approved by the local authority. Has Defra discussed with other European countries how they are handling this directive?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000105"></a>I make no apology for the highly interrogative nature of my contribution. We have a duty to ensure that the implications of these regulations have been thoroughly thought through by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to my remarks.</p>
<h5><a name="09102143000178"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

There was an obligation to transpose it by 16 January this year, so we are only 10 months late. By the normal standards of these things, perhaps I should congratulate the Government on being only some months late when compared with the years that it can sometimes take to do these things. Why it always takes so long is a mystery buried in the depths of Whitehall but at least this is being dealt with in the same calendar year, so I offer the Government some gentle congratulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000107"></a>As the Minister said, these regulations will not have a long life and will be absorbed into the environmental permitting regulations at some time in 2010. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. As they will simply be absorbed, that will not make much difference. By and large, these are sensible regulations that transpose a sensible directive and, in that respect, we give them a general welcome.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, spoke on the two aspects that require further probing. The first is the review of existing authorisations and the second is the issue of septic tanks and similar devices that lead to small-scale soakaways to which the regulations will apply from the beginning of January 2012.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000158"></a>What is a review? Will it be new or merely a desk review looking at regulations which, given the risk-based assessment that the Minister said would take place, will require further detailed investigation, while the majority will be put on the desk pile for regulations that do not need any change? Can the Minister explain exactly how this review will take place? This relates to what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said about resources. The figure of 20,000 is a lot, and if many of those authorisations are to be reviewed in detail, what resources will be involved? Will the Environment Agency have sufficient finance and manpower to carry out the task?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000110"></a>The noble Lord asked many detailed questions about septic tanks, some of which I was going to ask. I shall not go into detail on those because there is no point repeating what he said. Not all septic tanks will be affected. Some, especially those in urban areas, are emptied by a vehicle that comes around and takes away the contents. However, septic tanks with a soakaway will be affected in just over two years&#146; time. The fundamental questions are, first, does the Minister know how many of these installations there are around the country and, therefore, what the scale of the task is and, secondly, will the Environment Agency really have the resources to carry out the review, or will it rely on existing approvals and consents at a local level of the type that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, mentioned?</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000111"></a>In most cases, these soakaways do not cause a problem. They work&#151;they clearly soak away&#151;and, presumably, they are absorbed within the fairly immediate locality as biological processes deal with them over time so they do not get down into serious groundwater. There are a number of instances, however, where they cause serious problems. How is the Environment Agency going to determine which ones it needs to look at seriously? How will it separate the wheat from the chaff? The wheat will be a small proportion of the total, but there are problems that need to be looked at nevertheless. Will it be a matter of relying on complaints? If so, complaints from whom&#151;from nearby residents, owners of land or local authorities? Or will it simply apply throughout the whole lot? Presumably, it would take a long time to deal with them all.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000112"></a>These are serious issues, even though they are small-scale and local. On the one hand, we want problems tackled properly where they exist; on the other hand, in the majority of cases where there are not serious problems, we do not want a huge new tier of regulation and bureaucracy where it is not necessary. What is the answer to this conundrum? I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000113"></a>My final question is on the draft guidance that the Government intend to issue to the Environment Agency, and which it is going to consult on. What main issues will the guidance cover?</p>

<p><a name="09102143000116"></a>I want to pick up on one or two things. There is the question of how people will be notified. In very rural areas, websites are inadequate. The Minister will know well that we have had debates in the House about broadband; I think I have a Question coming up shortly on that very topic.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000117"></a>What is the position of an &#147;owner&#148; or a &#147;business&#148; rather than a tenant? Here I have to declare an interest: I have two cottages in our lane at home, one of which has a septic tank and the other a soakaway. This sounds very basic, but when the new tenant comes in, the septic tank is emptied, so they start at square one; after that, though, it is their responsibility. If they do not do what they should and thereby cause pollution, where does the buck stop? Does that come my way, or does it go to the tenant?</p>

Will the local authority be given direction from the Environment Agency? I am not clear who will operate the system. I know where the responsibility lies, but it is the practicality on which I seek clarification.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000120"></a>My last two questions follow from comments made by other noble Lords. One is on permits and the other is on the total cost and the likely cost to individuals.</p>

I am especially grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who gave me notice of his questions. He apologised for the interrogative nature of his speech. No apology is necessary; these are real issues that we need to identify. My only apology is because he asked me such a volley of questions that I may be slightly protracted in my reply.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000122"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who said that he would listen intently to the responses I made to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and who otherwise would have asked those questions if they had not already been put. If I take a little time over these issues, particularly as they relate to septic tanks, which has been the main burden of this discussion, I shall satisfy all noble Lords. I will also comment on the particular points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in her contribution.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000123"></a>I start by giving the good news first because it cheers me and I hope that it will do the same for the Committee. I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, how we compare with other European countries in how we tackle this issue. We think that we get off reasonably lightly. Many other EU countries are going to require full permits, probably at the municipal level because of the nature of their government&#151;that is certainly likely to be the case in Germany&#151;while others have clear registration and notification schemes that will require compliance. I hope that my answers will make it clear that we have a somewhat lighter touch than the full permit regime requires. That is the context in which I want to begin my response to the questions.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000124"></a>Obviously, the issue of septic tanks is very significant. Small discharges from isolated domestic dwellings not connected to the sewerage system were previously exempted from the requirement for authorisation. That will not be the case in the longer term and the intention is that, under the EPRs, discharges from septic tanks of two cubic metres or less should be subject to registration with the Environment Agency as exempt groundwater activities. Registration will be dependent on compliance with basic rules of operation and maintenance and will be free, as the consequence of a previous ministerial decision. Meanwhile, until 1 January 2012, small discharges&#151;those of under two cubic metres per day&#151;will continue to be exempt unless they are the cause of an environmental problem in that they might pollute a drinking water supply. In those cases the Environment Agency may serve a notice either to prohibit the activity or to require that a permit should be applied for. The arrangement will also apply in the case of registered exemptions under the EPRs. As is the case at present, all school discharges within a defined area around a drinking water supply will require a full permit, subject to an application charge but not subsistence charges.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000125"></a>That is the background, but the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has addressed to me a series of specific questions to which I want to reply so as to flesh out the issues which have been raised. If my responses do not do that, I will take note and be only too prepared to write subsequent to our proceedings to noble Lords who have contributed to the debate.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000126"></a>I was asked why the exemption limit has been set at two cubic metres per day. This is the Environment Agency&#146;s practical interpretation of the original exemption in the 1980 directive. It is a practical limit sufficient for the daily needs of a household of up to 10 persons. With regard to the 2006 directive, the position is that the 1980 groundwater directive and regulations of the   


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>same year exempt such discharges. The exemption is not sustained in either the water framework directive or the 2006 groundwater directive. The issue was explored at length in the European Parliament and an automatic exemption cannot be included in the new regulations except for a period lasting until January 2012, which recognises that the 1980 directive remains in force until we get to 2013.</p>
<h5><a name="09102143000181"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000127"></a>How many dwellings have septic tanks and how many other types of domestic sewage treatment are not connected to the mains sewerage? We estimate that there are approximately 300,000 septic tanks not connected to the mains sewerage system. Because septic tanks are not routinely controlled, it is impossible to know their location and precise number. That will be remedied once groundwater controls fall under the environmental permitting system and septic tanks are subject to a registration scheme. The regulations will apply to any installation from which there is a discharge, but not sealed cesspits.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000128"></a>The EA has about 20,000 discharge permits, input permits and groundwater extraction authorisations. How many permits do we estimate will be sought by the owners of domestic sewage systems? Probably several thousand will require a specific permit, because they are close to drinking water supplies, which is our obvious major concern. That requirement is no different from the current situation. Until 1 January 2012, other septic tanks will require no permit. Thereafter, under the proposed EPRs, all such discharges will be subject to a registration scheme and therefore subject to basic rules of sound operation and good maintenance.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000129"></a>It is germane to our discussion this afternoon that I replied to a Written Question from the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. He asked,</p>
<ul><a name="09102143000168"></a>&#147;how many permits covered by the draft Groundwater (England and Wales) Regulations 2009 are outstanding in each region in England and Wales&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102143000159"></a>The Answer was as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000163"></a>&#147;The following classes of permits are subject to the existing (1998) Groundwater Regulations and will become valid permits for the purposes of the Groundwater Regulations 2009 when they come into force:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000164"></a>(1) Consents to discharge to groundwater under the Water Resources Act 1991.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000165"></a>(2) Permits under Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007 where these may result in inputs to groundwater.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000166"></a>(3) Groundwater authorisations under the Groundwater Regulations 1998.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102143000167"></a>There are upwards of 20,000 such permits in total. The number of new applications and variations to such permits will fluctuate daily as they are submitted and processed according to statutory procedures. There is currently no significant backlog of applications&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000160"></a>So we have an order of magnitude, but I cannot be absolutely precise in my response.</p>
<ul><a name="09102143000169"></a>&#147;To provide an analysis of each outstanding permit broken down by region would require detailed searches of Environment Agency permitting databases which would incur disproportionate cost&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official </I><I>Report</I>, 5/10/09; col. <I>WA468</I>.]</ul>
<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000130"></a>On what grounds will the EA be able to refuse to issue a permit? Site-specific assessment will determine the circumstances in which a permit may be refused.   


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, that will normally happen only where there is pollution or the threat of pollution to a drinking water supply. Will any domestic sewage installations currently in use be rendered unsuitable by the implementation of the regulations and, if so, how many septic tanks and sewage plants will have to be replaced? The regulations introduce no specific new standards applying to the design, installation and maintenance of septic tanks. However, in current circumstances, an existing septic tank would be unsuitable if it results in an unacceptable discharge. There is no change in that respect deriving from the regulations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000131"></a>Will a web-based registration scheme for discharges from isolated dwellings be a record of all discharges or a record of septic tank owners? I emphasise that under the regulations, the current exemption continues until 1 January 2012. The objective is to know the location of septic tanks and which properties are served by them. That will facilitate the identification of problems and encourage good practice. I will come to the point about communication raised by the noble Baroness in more detail in a moment.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000132"></a>How does the Environment Agency discover that someone is discharging less than two cubic metres of effluent daily, and how does it chase it to the source? We intend to adopt a sensitive and light-touch approach whenever we can. It is possible to identify areas which are not served by mains sewerage and new properties by the planning system. The number of people occupying a property, which gives an indication of the volume of discharge is, as I said, 10, so we have some idea of where the problem may occur.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000133"></a>What is the current extent of groundwater pollution from domestic septic tanks that discharge less then 2 cubic centimetres a day can this be characterised by the type of location of concealed equipment? What is the level of resulting damage? The Environment Agency is aware of some locations where aggregations of septic tanks are believed to be responsible for pollution. Because of the absence of reliable data on the location of septic tanks, it is difficult to address these issues at present. The condition, operation and maintenance of equipment must determine its performance, as all noble Lords will recognise. Typically, diffuse pollution will result from some aggregation of septic tanks. Occasionally, an individual septic tank may threaten a drinking water supply&#151;hence the requirement for a permit when that tank is close to such drinking water locations.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000134"></a>What is the probable charge for a permit to use a septic tank? There will be no registration fee for the foreseeable future. There is an application fee for tanks which currently require a permit, which is a one-off charge of &#163;124. This is reviewed annually after consultation, but there is no annual subsistence charge. The Environment Agency&#146;s charging scheme for 2010-11, which is out to consultation, proposes a 1 per cent increase on the basic charge.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000135"></a>What is the Environment Agency&#146;s predicted cost of enforcing the legislation on daily discharges of less than 2 cubic centimetres from isolated dwellings? The cost of applications is fully covered by an application fee, in line with cost-recovery principles. Enforcement  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is carried out on a risk basis and costs to the Environment Agency are minimal. We can take some pleasure in that.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000136"></a>The impact assessment sought information on which groundwater policy would be reviewed to establish actual costs and benefits. The Government propose to make this part of the regular river basin management process. Will Defra then collate these data to come up with an annual summary of costs and benefits? We are a little foxed by this question, which is challenging. The Environment Agency has proposed individual impact assessments for each river basin management plan. These were published on Monday. As I indicated in my opening remarks, the review will be in line with the six-yearly, not annual, cycle of the plans.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000137"></a>How will the agency inform householders in isolated dwellings that they may require a permit and what will it need to make that decision? Since the exemption from the need for a permit lasts until January 2012, there is some time available to us to give this important issue full consideration. I recognise the anxieties to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, gave voice. The Environment Agency is considering how relevant requirement will be brought to the attention of septic tank users. Guidance on the requirements of these regulations, which will also apply to the EPRs, has been prepared and will be issued for consultation as soon as we have it ready. I accept entirely what the noble Baroness said, and noble Lord, Lord Taylor, indicated his concern about how we communicate effectively in these areas. I am all-too-well aware of the fact that government in all their forms need to do that. I answered a Question in the House only yesterday about the Inland Revenue and effective communication via the web. That is effective communication for a percentage of our citizens. It is less effective for some, due to their computer literacy, and for others because they do not have any access to the web. That was the point made by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. We need to address that issue and we take it on board entirely.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000138"></a>Will householders who pay to have septic tanks emptied need a permit? The answer is no. The regular emptying of a septic tank is a matter of good practice. Permits will be required in locations that are, for example, close to a drinking water supply. I return to the main concern that we all have about the purity of our water. All other tanks are exempt until January 2012 and thereafter will be subject to legislation under the proposed EPRs.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000139"></a>Will these regulations heap more costs onto the community for very little benefit? That was the theme of the noble Lord&#146;s anxieties. I can answer categorically no, in those terms. The impact assessment for the directive negotiations showed a broadly cost-neutral outcome in relation to resources already committed to the implementation of the water framework directive; that is our judgment, as I said in my opening remarks. The position on transposition is similar, although there is an element of swings and roundabouts in that some operators will benefit while others might incur modest additional costs. For example, permit holders under the existing regime may incur some additional costs for higher risk activities, but for those of a lower  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>risk, the costs may in fact be reduced. This is in line with the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle, to which we all subscribe and which is inherently fair.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000140"></a>I was asked whether charges to farmers will rise as a result of these regulations. They will not do so directly as they make no provision for additional or higher charges. They carry over the existing arrangements set out in the 1980 groundwater regulations they replace, and the charges made by the EA are reviewed annually through established arrangements for the agency to recover its costs, a point I made earlier. That is the sole concern of the agency in levying its fees. However, the 2006 groundwater directive does not stipulate a review period for authorisation, and neither do the proposed regulations. This means that a review can be conducted on the basis of need rather than a rigid four-year cycle. Less frequent reviews where this is possible will mean lower charges, and therefore will be welcomed by the Committee.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000141"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about the position of the landlord and the tenant. Normally, we would expect the liability to rest with the occupier and user, but there might be tenancy agreements written in different terms and, therefore, we cannot be categorical in the legislation. However, the expectation is that the occupier and user would be the liable person.</p>

<a name="91021-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102143000142"></a>I think that I have answered the questions put to me on the general aspects of communications, and I want to emphasise that in the department we are all too aware, as indeed is the Environment Agency, of the need for the effective communication of these important matters. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked me about a review of the permits, which will apply only to existing permits. Not all septic tanks are affected, rather it is only those with permits because they are in sensitive locations. There will be no specific review period for revision; it will be done when it is required.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000143"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102143000208"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords&#151;</p>

I do not think that the question about permits refers specifically to septic tanks. The question I asked was that although the new more flexible system of review is welcome, in that it does not have to be carried out every four years but will be done on the basis of risk, the regulations as set out appear to say that all existing permits have to be reviewed before 22 December 2012. My question concerned the scale of resources required to do that.</p>

If it were thought that the agency was levying charges that could not be justified by the actions being carried out, the Secretary of State would be expected to act. I am in no doubt that if it did not happen at this end of the building, there would be a fair fuss at the other end. There is a fallback position in those terms.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000152"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09102143000215"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> Before the Minister concludes, it is of interest that there are two elements to the regulations: there is the registration requirement and the permitting element. As I understand it, the permitting element refers to those in a location that may give rise to a hazard. If that is the case, I seek to make a plea to the Minister that for those whose responsibility is purely to register that they have a non-mains sewerage system, the registration should be kept as simple as possible. If the registration requires a full description of the system employed, I can assure him that in old properties, it is almost impossible to know quite how the system operates. Bits may have been added on, and it would be difficult for individuals if they subsequently found themselves falling foul of the regulations, which carry quite heavy penalties, because they had failed accurately to describe the full implications of their system. If registration is considered to be necessary, it should be kept as straightforward and simple as possible so that people feel that they can comply without too much wear and tear on their nerves.</p>

I said that we are concerned to deliver light-touch regulation. I entirely understand what he says about registration; that point will be borne in mind.</p>

<p><a name="09102143000154"></a><b><a name="91021-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09102143000217"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I wonder whether I can have one final bite at the review business. The Minister says that we are within a four-year review period that ends on 22 December 2012. Regulation 12(2) seems to say that all the existing permits must be reviewed between the coming into force of the regulations and that date, 22 December 2012. Is the Minister saying that in practice, reviews that have taken place during the past year&#151;because we appear to be about one year into the four-year review period&#151;will be counted, regardless of what the regulations say?</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09102127000509"></a>Census</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09102127000003"></a><b><a name="91021-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102127000503"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Cabinet Office (Angela E Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09102127000004"></a>The Draft Census (England and Wales) Order 2009 in Council providing for a census to be taken in England and Wales on Sunday 27 March 2011 has, today, been laid before Parliament. This order specifies the persons by whom, and with respect to whom, returns are to be made and the topics on which questions are to be asked, and gives effect to the United Kingdom Statistics Authority's proposals which were set out in the Government's White Paper, <I>Helping to Shape Tomorrow</I>, in December 2008.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09102127000005"></a>The census is the most important source of demographic and social statistics available in the UK today. It provides the underlying information needed to inform a wide range of policy debates and is used extensively to plan services and allocate funds to local areas.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09102127000006"></a>The design for the new census, as set out in the White Paper, builds upon the experience gained by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from previous censuses and, in particular, from the lessons learned from the 2001 census. The design takes account of the several formal recommendations from the Treasury Select Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the former Statistics Commission. It also reflects the concerns more recently expressed by the Treasury Sub-Committee and others about the quality of national and local population statistics generally.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09102127000007"></a>Consequently, a number of major changes are proposed in the design for 2011 compared with previous censuses:</p>
Census forms will be delivered to households by post in the majority of cases;there will be the facility to return the completed information online;a central address register is being developed to facilitate improved form delivery and field management;tighter control of the field operation and the targeting of non-response follow-up will be facilitated by closer monitoring of the delivery of forms and receipt of returns through a questionnaire tracking system; and 


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS60"></a><b>21 Oct 2009 : Column WS60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the recruitment, training and payment of field staff will be outsourced to specialist service providers.
<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09102127000008"></a>The topics proposed for the 2011 census are set out in the draft order, and cover those issues where information is most needed by the major users of census information. The questions have been devised to produce reliable and accurate data. ONS has carried out extensive consultations and testing over a number of years to ensure that the questions are justified, both in terms of the need for the information and public acceptability.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09102127000009"></a>New questions are proposed on: national identity; citizenship; second residences; language; civil partnership status; date of entry into the UK and length of intended stay (for non-UK born); type of central heating; and number of bedrooms.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09102127000010"></a>Copies of the 2011 census questionnaire will be included as part of the Census Regulations to be made early in 2010 following the Census Order.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09102127000011"></a>Following devolution, separate legislative arrangements will be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the censuses there. However, the census date proposed is common throughout the UK in order to maximise comparability, to minimise costs, and reduce public confusion.</p>

<a name="09102127000466"></a><b><a name="91021-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09102127000505"></a>The Minister for Trade and Investment (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Business and Regulatory Reform (Ian Lucas) has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_461"></a><a name="09102127000467"></a>The Government have today published a report on the Benefit-Cost Ratio of New Regulations Introduced in the Financial Year 2008-09.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_462"></a><a name="09102127000468"></a>The report shows that the benefits of new regulations enacted in the last financial year outweighed the costs by &#163;9 billion, at a ratio of nearly 2 to 1 and confirms the Government's commitment to strengthening regulatory management.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_463"></a><a name="09102127000469"></a>The figures, published as part of a new benefit-cost ratio, showed that overall quantifiable benefits exceeded costs by about 80 per cent, meaning that government regulation is expected to deliver &#163;1.85 in yearly benefits for every &#163;1 of cost, or a ratio of 1.85 to 1. The publication of the ratio, covering the 2008-09 legislative programme, is a world first and will be published annually in the future.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_464"></a><a name="09102127000470"></a>The Pensions Act 2008, aimed at enabling and encouraging more people to build up a private pension income to supplement the money received from their basic state pension, is an exceptional piece of legislation, with the highest benefits and costs in 2008-09, which has a significant effect on the overall ratio. If removed from the ratio, the benefit to cost ratio would increase to 4 to 1.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_465"></a><a name="09102127000471"></a>The benefit-cost ratio is drawn from the detailed assessments of the impact of new regulation produced by government departments and regulators. All departments and regulators that introduce new regulation that has a significant cost or benefit must produce a full impact assessment which is published in an online library.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_466"></a><a name="09102127000472"></a>The Government are fully committed to ensuring that all new regulation is justified and proportionate and that the benefits outweigh the costs. It builds on

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_467"></a><a name="09102127000473"></a>Regulation provides essential protections to employees, employers and citizens. Striking the right balance between costs and benefits is vital to make sure the regulatory framework is fit for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_468"></a><a name="09102127000474"></a>A copy of the report is being placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="09102127000475"></a><b><a name="91021-wms0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09102127000506"></a>The Minister for Trade and Investment (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> On 20 July, I tabled a Written Ministerial Statement in respect of our earlier consultation paper, <I>Family Legal Aid Funding from 2010</I>, published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Legal Services Commission (LSC) which set out proposals for legal aid payments for family work to apply from 2010 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WS 156</I>).</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_469"></a><a name="09102127000476"></a>Although I remained convinced that it is right to proceed with a harmonised family advocacy scheme, I asked my officials to undertake further analysis of the assumptions that underpin the modelling of the fee schemes, to ensure the accuracy of that modelling. This additional work was necessary as there had been some significant changes made to our original consultation proposals following detailed discussion with stakeholders about the structure of both the advocacy and representation schemes.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_470"></a><a name="09102127000477"></a>In particular, we have introduced more graduation into the fee scheme structure to ensure that those advocates who take on the more difficult and complicated cases are fairly rewarded. In addition, I decided not to proceed with our proposal to remove independent social work from scope in private law cases but will continue to work with Cafcass to determine the best way to use our mutual resources for the benefit of vulnerable children.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_471"></a><a name="09102127000478"></a>I am now satisfied that the new fee schemes are based on robust data and accurate modelling, and that the final scheme allows us to achieve a reasonable balance between complexity and value for money.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_472"></a><a name="09102127000479"></a>The new fee schemes direct more money into public law cases to ensure that children and adults at risk of abuse take the highest priority for legal services. The fee schemes do not represent cuts to the family legal aid budget or to the services received by children and families, but some funding will be moved from barristers to solicitor advocates, as barristers and solicitor advocates will now receive the same fees for the same advocacy work. The fee schemes have been designed to be cost neutral against 2007-08 average case costs.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_473"></a><a name="09102127000480"></a>The LSC will shortly publish the response document and impact assessment on their website and the new schemes will be introduced with the new civil contracts in October 2010.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_475"></a><a name="09102127000484"></a>It is right that all taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. However, there are a minority who continue to seek ways to avoid paying their share. This is unacceptable. It is unfair on the majority of taxpayers, undermines fiscal sustainability, and reduces funding for public services. This Government will not tolerate tax avoidance or tax evasion in any form, and will act promptly to tackle both of these.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_476"></a><a name="09102127000485"></a>Several tax avoidance schemes have been notified to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) exploiting the sideways loss relief and double tax relief (DTR) rules, so I am today announcing changes to be made to legislation, with immediate effect, to counter these schemes.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_478"></a><a name="09102127000487"></a>As made clear by the Paymaster-General in her Written Statement on 2 March 2007 and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in subsequent Finance Acts, the Government will not tolerate avoidance schemes designed to exploit sideways loss relief rules. The Government have recently become aware of a contrived and aggressive avoidance scheme that seeks to generate losses in a professional partnership for offset by users of the scheme against their other income or capital gains by way of sideways loss relief. This scheme relies on the creation of losses through a series of arrangements that are established for the purposes of tax avoidance.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_479"></a><a name="09102127000488"></a>The Government do not accept that these arrangements have the effect that is sought, but to remove any doubt, and to prevent scheme providers continuing to devise and operate even more contrived schemes that seek to challenge the sideways loss relief rules, I am announcing prompt and decisive action to protect the Exchequer.</p>

<a name="91021-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_480"></a><a name="09102127000489"></a>With effect from today a general rule will be introduced to prevent sideways loss relief being given where the loss arises from arrangements and a main purpose of the arrangements is to obtain a tax reduction by

<p><a name="wms_stpa_483"></a><a name="09102127000492"></a>HMRC has been notified that unauthorised unit trusts are being used to avoid restrictions on double tax relief and to generate &#147;repayments&#148; of tax that the UK Exchequer has not received. To counter this, legislation will be introduced with the effect that to the extent any distribution treated as paid by a unauthorised unit trust is paid out of overseas income on which UK tax has been reduced by DTR, the distribution will be treated by the recipient as overseas income under deduction of overseas tax. The legislation will have effect from today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_487"></a><a name="09102127000496"></a>To counter this, legislation will be introduced amending the relevant DTR anti-avoidance provision so that it applies to deemed overseas tax deducted from MODs in the same way that it applies to real overseas dividends.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_490"></a><a name="09102127000499"></a>HMRC has been notified that UK manufactured interest payments are being used to avoid tax under the rules relating to controlled foreign companies (CFCs) by artificial generation of DTR.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_491"></a><a name="09102127000500"></a>To counter this, regulations, coming into force today, will be made repealing rules that deem companies to have received UK manufactured interest under deduction of tax. Instead, the recipient will simply be taxed on the amount of manufactured interest it receives with no relief for any notional tax credit.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_492"></a><a name="09102127000501"></a>HMRC has identified a provision in separate regulations dealing with MODs that would allow substantially the same scheme to be implemented using MODs.

Instead, the recipient will be taxed on the amount of the MOD it receives with no relief for any notional tax credit.</p>

A number of officials from DECC and Defra have been in contact with National Grid over the past few months regarding the report. As noted in the renewable energy strategy, our analysis indicates that the technical potential of biogas generation for heat and power is about 10-20 TWh or more. Recent work increased that assessment of technical potential of biogas production from anaerobic digestion to 27TWh. These estimates do not include an assessment of the potential contribution of gasification technology, given the uncertainties surrounding when this technology will become commercially available. We have encouraged National Grid to input comments into the latest analysis published alongside the RES to help us to revise and improve our data. National Grid, with a number of other interested parties, also participated in the subsequent seminar to discuss this analysis. We will publish revisions to this analysis alongside the RHI consultation in December. However as this is an evolving area, we recognise the need to keep our analysis under review.</p>
