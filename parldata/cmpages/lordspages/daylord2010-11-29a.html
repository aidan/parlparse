<a name="1011297000002"></a><b><a name="101129-0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1011297000511"></a>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Brabazon of Tara):</b> My Lords, as your Lordships would expect with a building as old and heavily used as the Palace of Westminster, there are some very significant maintenance issues which require considerable investment. The Parliamentary Estates Directorate is in the process of formulating a 25-year strategy to address these challenges. The most pressing problem is that the mechanical and electrical systems are in a poor state of repair, which is why we have embarked on a five-year programme of "aggressive maintenance" to mitigate the most serious equipment failures. At the same time, investigative studies are taking place to scope the longer-term programme of works.</p>

Is he aware that on the odd occasion when I have seen him in conversation with worried-looking officials, it has normally been about the state of the building? As we spend an awful lot of time here, can he tell us what is the state of the walls, the foundations and, in particular, the roof?</p>

If I look worried, it is largely because of the mechanical and electrical programme which I mentioned in my Answer; that is a serious programme. As for the roofs, noble Lords will be aware that the first phase of replacement of the cast iron roofs has taken place down at Speaker's Court end, and the scaffolding is now being removed. That is the first phase. We need to take stock of the results of that work before we move to the next phase, which will be the south return-down that end of the building. Unfortunately, the results of the work on the first phase have been more difficult than we had anticipated. We had anticipated that about 10 per cent of the roof tiles would be good; as it turns out, in some places, nearly half have had to be replaced.</p>

All that is having to be dealt with.</p>

I hope that your Lordships will agree that it is better today than it was last week-particularly in the Chamber. It is a major problem with an old building such as this that a lot of the hot air that we produce in this House leaks out through doors, and so on, being left open. We are conducting serious work on this. We have someone looking around the place to see where the main causes of trouble are.</p>

The water usually comes in at this time of year, normally as a result of bad repairs to the original structure, which was obviously of a much higher standard than the repairs.</p>

Last summer, we estimated that a September sitting in the House of Lords would have added approximately £1.3 million to the cost of shared and Lords-only projects.

I know that he shares a great interest in overseas development. In 2009-10, 62 per cent of DfID's aid budget was spent through multilateral organisations. This includes funding at headquarters level and support for particular programmes and projects at country level. The Government are currently reviewing their bilateral and multilateral spending in order to maximise effectiveness and value for money. These reviews will determine the future shape of our aid budget in terms of how much funding we provide to different countries and international organisations.</p>

Some 56 per cent of the world's ODA is provided through the EU and 43 per cent of the European Commission's overall budget goes to low-income countries. The EU also supports middle income countries, where 75 per cent of the world's poor live. The effectiveness of EU aid has increased steadily over the past 10 years. It is now faster, more flexible and more predictable. Over the past five years, EC aid has helped 9 million children to enrol in primary education and 31 million households to access better drinking water.</p>

Is it not quite absurd that we should hand over money to Brussels to be laundered there?

We did not agree with that, but unfortunately it is now in place and we will need to make it work. We will need to make sure that controls are in place. However, spending through the EU has its own management systems-the Internal Audit Service, the European Court of Auditors and the independent European Anti-Fraud Office.</p>

Some 75 per cent of the developing world's poor-2 billion people-live in rural areas. The majority depend on agriculture to provide jobs and incomes. Agriculture has a key role to play in helping to meet the millennium development goal of halving the proportion of people in the world suffering from extreme poverty and hunger.

As he said very honestly in his response to the original Statement a couple of weeks ago, when in government, the Opposition were planning cuts in legal aid. Whenever one makes cuts, one has to draw the line somewhere, and the Opposition are rightly leaping to the defence of people on the wrong side of that line. We have made a decision in terms of making savings in the legal aid budget and we have done so in a way that we believe targets help to the most vulnerable.</p>

The problem that we faced-and the previous Administration faced it too-is that legal aid is being used to cover a wider range of advice and help which can be better funded and supported in other ways. My honourable friend Jonathan Djanogly is having meetings with representatives of Citizens Advice in the next week. We will be looking at ways of helping citizens advice bureaux and other non-legal providers of advice.</p>

This is precisely the thinking behind our proposals. Under what I will call the old regime of legal aid, far too many cases, particularly in the area of family law, were taken down the legal route. We believe that mediation and other forms of settlement would be far more effective. On the question of the not-for-profit organisations such as citizens advice bureaux and others that are going to be hit by the cut in legal aid, the Government are setting up a transition fund, the announcement of which will be made tomorrow. Affected bodies can apply to this fund.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="1011297000050"></a><b>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his question and for his extended interest in this subject. A cross-party committee has been set up to produce a draft Bill for House of Lords reform. I understand that the cross-party committee is considering the relationship between the two Chambers and the conventions on which this relationship is based.</p>

It would be nice if we could be told more about it. I would put it to him that the most crucial recommendation in the report of the Cunningham committee on conventions between the two Houses was this:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="1011297000117"></a>"Should any firm proposals come forward to change the composition of the House of Lords, the conventions between the Houses would have to be examined again".</p>

<p><a name="1011297000114"></a>Given that the committee had its report unanimously endorsed by both Houses of Parliament-a pretty rare occurrence-it is not the clear responsibility of the Government to reconvene the committee or establish a similar committee so that this crucial matter of the constitutional impact of an elected House of Lords on the relationship between the two Houses can be debated publicly? It is the very least the Government should provide.</p>

The noble Lord may recall that during his debate I answered a question from the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, on exactly this issue. I suggested then that he was putting the cart before the horse. We need to see the shape of House of Lords reform, as proposed by the draft Bill, before we are able to consider how the conventions would fit in to that new House. To try to anticipate the reports of the committee would be a great mistake.</p>

It indicated that the relationship between the two Houses that the committee had described would be fit for purpose unless the functions of the new elected House of Lords were changed. Can he say whether "this secret committee", as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, is considering functions as well as composition?</p>

It is a circular argument, is it not? I cannot imagine that the noble Baroness the Leader of the Opposition and my noble friends the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House would be sitting on this committee without engaging in the whole question of how this House functions and how its conventions would fit in with any reformed House. I can understand the impatience of the House to find out what this committee is producing but we need to have patience until early in the new year when the draft Bill comes before us.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="1011297000064"></a>The Motion in my name seeks the agreement of the House to suspend Standing Order 46 on Tuesday 7 December to allow the remaining stages of the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill to be taken formally immediately after Second Reading. This is necessary because Standing Order 46 prevents more than one stage of a Bill being taken in any one day. This is a perfectly standard Motion for a Bill that has been certified as a money Bill by Mr Speaker in another place.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1011297000065"></a>The established practice of the House in respect of money Bills is to have a Second Reading debate and then to take the remaining stages formally. Why do we do this? Because the Parliament Act 1911 restricts the powers of the House of Lords in relation to money Bills. Under that Act this House has one calendar month to pass a money Bill without amendment. If it does not do so, the Bill is given Royal Assent without the agreement of this House. If this House passes amendments, the other place, quite properly, totally disregards them if it chooses to do so. This House does not normally go into Committee on a money Bill because there is no point and successive Governments have chosen not to waste the time of the House in this way.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1011297000066"></a>With the agreement of the usual channels, the Government have set aside a whole day for the Second Reading debate next week. Ultimately, it does not matter whether the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie is agreed to; it does not make any difference. We can amend the Bill, re-amend it or reject it outright, but it will become law anyway in exactly its current form. However-and this is the serious part-apparently, after 99 years of this House respecting both the spirit and the letter of the Parliament Act 1911, the Opposition feel that now is the time to change that. In nearly 100 years this House has never seen an opposition challenge to money Bill procedures under the Parliament Act. The House might forgive the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, for inexperience in such matters if he were new to the Front Bench opposite, but until just seven months ago he was a Minister of the Crown. He and his colleagues know exactly how these things should work.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1011297000067"></a>Only last week the House considered two money Bills. The Opposition did not see fit to challenge the certification of Mr Speaker on those Bills. The noble Lord even responded for the Opposition on one of them. There were no Motions on the Order Paper last week-those Bills were taken through their remaining stages formally, in the normal way, after a Second Reading, with the Opposition's agreement-so the established practice of dealing with money Bills was perfectly acceptable to the Opposition last week, but not, it seems, this week. Indeed, it is even worse than that. The way in which this House deals with money Bills was perfectly acceptable to the Opposition when they were in Government. Between 1997 and 2010, this House considered a total of 64 Bills that were  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certified as money Bills by Mr Speaker in the other place. Over 40 per cent of them were in the last Parliament alone. We disagreed with many of these Bills; we felt that the financial policies of the party opposite would lead the country to financial ruin, as it almost did, but how many of these Bills were taken through substantive stages after Second Reading, how many of these Bills were subject to a challenge from the then opposition on grounds of process? None at all. It was not seen as this House's way of doing things, so why is it seen as the way for us to proceed now?</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1011297000068"></a>There is a feeling from this side of the House of, "Here we go again". The Opposition are clearly set on continuing their procedural mischief-making. A clear pattern has emerged. Back in June we had a Motion to refer the Local Government Bill to the Examiners, two weeks ago we had a similar Motion on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, today we have an unprecedented Motion on a money Bill, and tomorrow yet another unprecedented procedural Motion appears on the Order Paper.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1011297000069"></a>A few weeks ago I asked from this Dispatch Box whether the party opposite wanted to be a serious party of opposition, or whether it wanted to see the kinds of procedural ploys, wheezes and games that we see again today. The answer is becoming increasingly clear-the party opposite would prefer to manufacture time-wasting debates than to get on with the important business of the Public Bodies Bill on today's Order Paper. They want to make this place like another place: a House that spends hour after hour on procedural debate. I have to tell the noble Lord that this vision for the House is not shared by the majority of noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1011297000070"></a>There is no issue, and there is no need to challenge the way in which this House deals with money Bills; this is nothing but an attempt at opportunism. I am sure that noble Lords will see it for what it is, and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1011297000072"></a>The Bill has been certified as a money Bill by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The amendment seeks not to challenge that certification but to deal with the consequences of the Bill's being so designated. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said that we have not sought to do so in similar debates on recent Bills that have gone through your Lordships' House. Indeed we have not-as he outlined, I participated in such a debate just last week-but this is a different Bill. We are trying to achieve a Committee stage only for the Bill before us.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1011297000073"></a>The noble Lord rightly cited the Parliament Act, but the <I>Companion</I> says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="1011297000118"></a>"If a money bill, which has been passed by the Commons and sent up to the Lords at least one month before the end of a session, is not passed by the Lords without amendment within a month after it is sent to them, the bill shall, unless the Commons direct to the contrary, be presented for Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords. This does not debar the Lords from amending such bills provided they are passed within the month, but the Commons are not obliged to consider the amendments".</p>

<p><a name="1011297000115"></a>Why on earth the noble Lord seeks to pre-empt what we might do-whether the Bill might be amended if we had a Committee stage, and indeed what the Commons' reaction to that might be-is a little strange. We do not see the Committee process as having no point.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1011297000074"></a>The Bill will do three things: it will stop any further government contributions to child trust funds; it will end the savings gateway; and it will abolish the health in pregnancy grant. It was somewhat surprising to us that a Bill of this nature was designated as a money Bill, particularly given that the setting up of each of these arrangements was by way of separate primary legislation that included all the usual stages in your Lordships' House. It was also a surprise to our colleagues in another place. A reading of their proceedings will illustrate their clear belief that there would be the opportunity to continue to advance the argument for some changes to the Bill at this end and, in so far as I can tell, the Minister, Mr Hoban, did not offer a contrary view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1011297000075"></a>The Bill's being certified as a money Bill denies this House the full opportunity to bring its knowledge and experience to bear on major matters of social policy concerning poverty, family and child welfare and the health of pregnant women. I do not propose to speak in detail to the range of issues that might be raised in Committee, but I will say that that particularly denies the opportunity to develop and amend how the Bill impacts on looked-after children. For example, the position of looked-after children has been the subject of ongoing discussion, initiated by Paul Goggins MP, about the hiatus between the abolition of child trust funds and the promised introduction of junior ISAs. That is very much work in progress. The discussion, involving the Minister, recognised that looked-after children have only the state or their corporate parent to make the equivalent of parental contributions to these savings vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1011297000076"></a>As we know, it is often the case that issues emerge during the consideration of legislation in another place. Amendments may be proposed, arguments advanced and rebuffed and then reconsidered and reformulated for consideration here. Knowing that there can be a second bite at the cherry-a chance for some reflection, challenge and consensus-building-has proved an important element in improving legislation. We know that some stakeholders are particularly frustrated at knowing late in the day that the House of Commons was possibly their only chance to improve legislation. Noble Lords may have heard from Action for Children, Barnardo's, the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, Gingerbread and the Family and Parenting Institute. We are seeking the opportunity for the Bill to have a proper Committee stage so that those matters that some consider to be unfinished business can be properly examined. The rules allow it; we know it must be done expeditiously in order not to fall foul of the one-month rule; and we would co-operate in the timely scheduling of the Bill's stages.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1011297000077"></a>This matter raises a broader issue. As I have made clear, we do not seek to challenge today a certification of the Speaker, but we need to understand it and its possible future ramifications for our deliberations. We understand that this is a money Bill because, although the setting up of child trust funds, the savings gateway and the health in pregnancy grant were matters of policy, a parliamentary measure that only withdraws funding for them is a money Bill, notwithstanding the fact that removing funding involves prioritisation-and therefore policy changes-and will bring to an end these particular policy mechanisms. We fear that such designation paves the way for the Government to rely on the cloak of deficit reduction in a way that would deny your Lordships the opportunity fully to scrutinise swathes of policy, from the withdrawal of education maintenance allowance to changes to the benefits system. That would deny this House what it does best. This is a matter to reflect on both here and in another place.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1011297000078"></a>For today, we simply ask to have the opportunity to have a proper Committee stage on a Bill that has significant social policy ramifications. If we cannot achieve even that, what hope is there for the future? Let me be clear that the amendment seeks not to challenge the Speaker's decision-the amendment accepts the decision-but to apply to the full, and without expanding, the restricted opportunities available to this House when dealing with a money Bill. The amendment does not seek to frustrate the timetable of the Government. If we do not pass this Bill by Christmas Recess, the Bill will go for Royal Assent anyway. The amendment would not undermine the thrust of the Government's deficit reduction plan, whatever our disagreement with that plan. This is about us-all parties and none-having a chance to input into important policy changes that will affect the lives of many young people and families. That is, after all, why we are here. I beg to move.</p>

I say this because almost every piece of social security legislation could in future fall under the remit of being labelled a money Bill and therefore not available for debate or scrutiny in this House.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1011297000080"></a>Let me give two examples, in which I suggest that this House has more experience and more to offer on this debate than most other agendas, and probably more than the other place. We know, for example, that there is a question over whether the mobility component for people in long-term residential care will be removed. On previous debates my noble friend Lady Wilkins and the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, spoke passionately about that. Such a move would remove money resulting from a policy established in primary legislation back in 1992, by the then Government, which we all supported. Under this precedent, that could be labelled a money Bill, and notwithstanding the expertise of this House in disability matters, about which this House feels very strongly indeed, we would not be permitted to debate it. It not just about this House and about Parliament-hundreds of thousands of disabled people would be affected as a result.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1011297000081"></a>In another example, a week or two ago I led a debate on housing. There were half a dozen of us on these Benches, half a dozen from the Lib Dem Benches, who made very powerful speeches, half a dozen from the Cross Benches, and one person, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, from the Conservative Benches. We analysed forensically the issues associated with changes in housing, and I welcome the fact that the Government appear to be listening to some of those concerns. In future, if this is a precedent, nearly all those issues that we debated would be, and could be, classified as a part of a money Bill and not available for this House to discuss, explore, revise and, if necessary, to ask the other place to think again about.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1011297000082"></a>This is extraordinarily dangerous. There is hardly any piece of government policy that does not involve expenditure. This means that, in theory, almost every piece of policy could be regarded as a money Bill and this House would be denied scrutiny of it. I have given just two examples from social security but it could affect a lot of local government funding as well. I hope that your Lordships will today accept my noble friend's amendment; and that perhaps consultations could take place between the two Houses to make sure that the other House realises the seriousness of the precedent that could be set, and that we would be walking away from a major part of our responsibility to the public we seek to serve.</p>

This is the first time in all of those 48 years that I have heard a challenge to the Speaker's certification of a Bill as a money Bill. The amendment is quite inappropriate. It seeks to drive another coach and horses through our constitutional protections-so much a feature of the previous Government. The amendment should be quickly withdrawn.</p>

The interests of such children and young people need to be considered very carefully. I am concerned that so little time is being allowed to debate the impact of the Bill on these young people. I would grateful to learn from the Minister how it will affect the trust funds for children in care, established by the previous Government, and how the Minister plans to make up for any loss to young people leaving local authority care. Many of us have felt ashamed of our historic treatment of young people in local authority care. It is beyond any doubt that their interests have been overlooked. It was deeply gratifying to see the seriousness with which the previous Government took the welfare of this neglected group and it is encouraging to see the coalition sustaining this.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1011297000085"></a>Ten years ago, only 1 per cent of young people in local authority care went to university. Recent research has highlighted that 8 to 9 per cent are now accessing higher education. That is still disappointing but it is a more than 800 per cent improvement on the past. The lesson is that many of these children can do far better in life than we have allowed. We need to be better at keeping their interests close to our hearts. Given their chaotic early experiences in their families, and often in care, it is vital to offer young people leaving care all the help we can as-we hope-they recover from this chaos and find direction for their lives. That is why the trust fund for children in care is so important to these young people. It helps some of them to make a fresh start and makes up in a small way for the fact that they are often left high and dry, without the support our own children would receive from us.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1011297000086"></a>I support the noble Lord's amendment. I understand the Minister's predicament; there is no room for complacency about reducing the deficit. However, we have let these children down too often before by not placing their interests high enough in our priorities. I would welcome information from the Minister on what steps he and his colleagues may be considering to protect the interests of these children once this legislation is passed. A meeting to discuss this would be very welcome.</p>

I understand that the Leader of the House has told us that, regardless of what we do in this House, the other place has absolutely no need to take any account of us because this is a money Bill. If it were not a money Bill, I would have some sympathy with the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the speakers from the Labour Benches. However, since this is a money Bill, I cannot see what good we can do or why one day would not be sufficient to deal with all these matters. Everybody can-to use a colloquialism-sound off in one day totally effectively when we are dealing with a money Bill.</p>

However, we are faced with a different problem: the certification by the Speaker that it is a money Bill. I fully agree with my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham who says that this would set an unfortunate precedent. I fully agree with those who say that this Bill deserves a proper examination in Committee. However, we are faced with a fact, which is that it has been certified as a money Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1011297000089"></a>We should be thinking about whether there is some way in which we can have a proper discussion-perhaps in a Joint Committee-on what a money Bill is, because that is the problem. It is open to abuse if one side says that this is a money Bill and the other side says it is not. We need to have a proper discussion of what a money Bill is and get it settled once and for all.</p>

I totally respect all of those who spoke in favour of the Bill and those who had problems with issues of the Bill. At some moments it sounded as if we had already started the Second Reading of the Bill rather than dealing with the Motion on the Order Paper. I have no detailed view of the different aspects of the Bill. The right time to deal with those would be on Second Reading.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1011297000091"></a>The point in my introduction was made-if I may say so-far more ably by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It does not matter if we have this Committee stage. In the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, we can explore, we can advise, we can amend, we can even reject, and we can ask the House of Commons to think again. The House of Commons is under no obligation whatever to deal with any of these issues. That is the nub of my argument. There is no point doing any of these things because it is a waste of our time. Let us spend our precious time on things that are useful and have an impact rather than on those that do not. I have very little further to add and in light of what I and others have said, I call upon the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

One could argue whether the Speaker should or should not have certified it. The fact is that he did certify it and, therefore, certain consequences flow from that, which I accept. However, the danger as it is perceived, certainly by me, and, I suspect, by many on this side is that that certification will become too gross, happen too often and be too restrictive as far as this House is concerned.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1011297000093"></a>This issue is important in relation to this Bill. However, it is even more important in relation to a whole host of other Bills coming up. If one wishes to certify something as a money Bill, you can invariably find some excuse for doing so, as my noble friend Lady Hollis said. There is no point in the noble Lord shaking his head. He knows that as well as I do. So I ask him very simply: can he put his considerable weight behind an attempt to get some clarification on what is or is not a money Bill by negotiations or discussions between this House and the other place? Otherwise, we will have this issue coming up again and again, which would be extraordinarily unhealthy.</p>

It goes to the root of the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. Is she right when she says that the mere fact of a Bill involving public expenditure makes it possible for it to be certified as a money Bill? If that is so, then it is extremely serious and of massive constitutional relevance.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1011297000096"></a>Is it then the case-I do not have the wording of the 1911 Act before me-that since 1911 it has been a matter of restraint not to certify possibly thousands of Bills that might have been money Bills but for good reason have not been so regarded? Am I right in thinking that although the 1911 Act very considerably curtails the effect of any amendment made by this House, there is not one word in it that suggests that we should not discuss a money Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_75"></a>

There will be a very full Second Reading day on it, especially given this debate. It is right that this House's voice should be heard, but it cannot be heard more than the Parliament Act 1911 allows. This is so well precedented over the past 99 years that even I, who like history and historical anecdotage in the House of Lords, find this whole debate extraordinary.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="1011297000098"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, and the noble Lord asked about the Speaker's role in all this. Parliament Acts are a long-standing part of the constitutional settlement of the United Kingdom. Under the Parliament Act 1911, Mr Speaker is under a statutory duty to certify a Bill a money Bill if, in his opinion, it contains provisions dealing with national taxation, public money, loans or their management. The important words there are "a statutory duty". It is not a choice; Mr Speaker has no discretion in the matter. That goes to answer the point of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, who gave the impression that somehow there was discretion in this matter, and that I could say to the Speaker, "On balance, old boy, could you certify rather fewer money Bills?". That is not the case. It is done on advice given by Mr Speaker's Clerks on the basis of a statutory provision. The decision to certify this Bill a money Bill is taken entirely by Mr Speaker in another place. We accept the consequences of that because of the 1911 Act and all the precedents that have been set over the past 100 years. In my opening speech, I talked about the 60-odd money Bills that have arisen in the past 13 years. The outrage on the part of noble Lords opposite is extraordinary given that, seven months ago, they were sitting on this side of the House but never once did they scratch their heads and say, "These money Bills are a bit odd. We really should repeal the 1911 Act".</p>

However, the difference is that we knew that a Bill had been certified a money Bill before it ended its legislative process in the House of Commons. Can the noble Lord tell me the last occasion on which a Bill was certified a money Bill at the very end of its legislative process in the House of Commons? That is a big distinction, as the House of Commons understood that this Bill would go through all its legislative process in this Chamber.</p>

However, I find it very difficult to help the noble Baroness the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. It is as if noble Lords assume that I had greater knowledge than I have of what decisions were being taken in another place on the certification of money Bills, or when the decision was taken. My understanding is that it is not a decision of the Government but of Mr Speaker, taken on advice from his Clerks. I dare say that the stage at which he makes that decision is up to the internal procedures of another place. The point about this House is that we have to deal with the effects of the decision that has been taken in another place. We have no discretion in the matter. If it is certified a money Bill, a money Bill it is. If it is a money Bill, whatever we do to it matters not a jot because another place can ignore that comprehensively.</p>

However, I agree with the range of speakers-the noble Lords, Lord Richard, Lord Crathorne and Lord Elystan-Morgan, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis-who say that it would be good to have some sort of process to try and better understand when a money Bill is a money Bill and what the rules are that apply to that.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="1011297000119"></a>"On a few occasions minor amendments have been made by the Lords to such bills and have been accepted by the Commons".</p>

<p><a name="1011297000116"></a>This presumption that it is all a waste of time, that nothing could ever happen that could change the Bill, is simply not the case. Even if it were, if it was felt that matters should be pressed on the Government in relation to a Bill, why should we not avail ourselves of the opportunity to do so? I stress that my amendment does not seek to change the rules at all or to say that the House of Commons Speaker was wrong in certifying it as a money Bill; it merely seeks to take advantage of what the <I>Companion</I> enables us to do as a House.</p>

However, there is a difference between a debate on the Bill at Second Reading and in Committee, as all noble Lords know. The Committee stage is an iterative process, a chance to press the Minister in detail on a range of points. A one-day Second Reading does not provide the same facility.

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10112928000002"></a>"I would like to make a Statement regarding the Office for Budget Responsibility's first autumn forecast. I will also inform the House about further measures that the Government are taking to support economic growth, including the new growth review launched today and a far-reaching programme of reforms to our corporate tax system. Following yesterday's announcement by European Finance Ministers, I would also like to take the first opportunity to update the House about the Irish situation and the UK's involvement.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10112928000003"></a>First, on the OBR's autumn forecast-copies of which were made available in the Vote Office earlier today-we should take a moment to recognise the significance of this occasion and the practical demonstration of this Government's commitment to transparency and independent forecasting. Today is the first time that Members of this House will engage in debate about an autumn forecast that has been produced by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility-rather than conjured up by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-and made available to read two hours before the Statement. This is also the first forecast by the new independent chair of the OBR, Robert Chote, with the other members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, Stephen Nickell and Graham Parker, whose appointments were approved by all Treasury Select Committee members from both sides of this House. The country can have full confidence in the independence of these members.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10112928000004"></a>The OBR report published today includes some 150 pages of information-an unprecedented level of detail and transparency-much of which is of the kind that was available to previous Governments but never published. I would like to thank the Budget Responsibility Committee and the staff of the OBR for their hard work in putting together this autumn forecast. I hope that we will now entrench this major improvement in the making of fiscal policy by passing the legislation currently before Parliament. While today's figures are, of course, independent, they are still just forecasts and we must treat them with the degree of caution with which one should treat any forecast. Indeed, the OBR is explicit about that. The report illustrates the uncertainty surrounding any economic forecasts with the use of fan charts rather than claim the infallible certainty that my predecessors asserted when they provided their forecasts. Indeed, the only thing that was infallible and certain was that those political forecasts were wrong.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10112928000005"></a>With that caution in mind, let me turn to the forecast. After the deepest recession since the war, the greatest budget deficit in our peacetime history and the biggest banking crisis of our lifetime, recovery was always going to be more challenging than after previous recessions, but the message from the Office for Budget  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1284"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Responsibility is that Britain's economic recovery is on track. The economy is growing; more jobs are being created; and the deficit is falling. The OBR's central forecast is for sustainable growth of more than 2 per cent for each of the next five years, with employment rising in each and every year. At a time when markets are gripped by fears about government finances across Europe, today we see that the Government were absolutely right to take the decisive action to take Britain out of the financial danger zone. Britain is on course both to grow the economy and to balance the books-something that some people repeatedly said would not happen.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10112928000006"></a>Let me take the House through the detail of the forecast. The forecasts for the economy are broadly in line with those produced for the June Budget, despite the more challenging international conditions. I would also like to point out that they are very similar to the European Commission forecast for the UK, which is also published today. They forecast that Britain will grow faster over the next two years than Germany, France, Japan and the United States of America as well as faster than the average for the eurozone and the EU. The OBR forecasts real GDP growth of 1.8 per cent this year, 2.1 per cent next year, 2.6 per cent in 2012, 2.9 per cent the year after that, 2.8 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10112928000007"></a>Growth this year is now expected to be considerably higher than was forecast in June. In the OBR's judgment, some of this improvement is likely to be permanent and some of it a temporary impact of stock building. As a result, the OBR forecasts that the rate of growth next year will be 0.2 percentage points below the forecast that the OBR made in June. The OBR also predicts above-trend growth for the four years after that. The level of GDP, or the overall size of our economy, is forecast to be around half a percentage point higher next year than was forecast in June and, indeed, higher throughout the whole forecast period.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10112928000008"></a>Some have made predictions of a so-called "double-dip" recession. While the OBR points out that,</p>
<ul><a name="10112928000131"></a>"growth has been volatile as this is a common characteristic of post recession recoveries",</ul>
<p><a name="10112928000120"></a>its central view is that there will be no double-dip recession. Its forecast is for growth next year of more than 2 per cent, and it expects that the slowest quarter of growth, in the first quarter of next year, will be 0.3 per cent, rising back up to 0.7 per cent by the last quarter of next year. The OBR also forecasts that CPI inflation will fall from 3.2 per cent in 2010 to 1.9 per cent in 2012, once the short-term effects of the VAT rise and other temporary factors fall away.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10112928000009"></a>Crucially, the OBR forecasts a gradual rebalancing of the economy as we move away from an economy built on debt to an economy where we invest and export-again, something that some people said would not happen. The OBR expects more demand to come from business investment, which is set to grow by more than 8 per cent for each of the next four years, as well as from exports, which are expected to grow on average by more than 6 per cent per year. This new model of sustainable economic growth will rebalance the economy towards investment and exports and away from an unhealthy dependence on private debt and public deficits. We will thus bring to an end the  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1285"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unsustainable situation that saw families save less and less year after year so that they ended up, in the words of the OBR report today,</p>
<ul><a name="10112928000132"></a>"effectively borrowing money to purchase increasingly expensive houses".</ul>
<a name="101129-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10112928000010"></a>The OBR has also published today a full forecast for the labour market-something that, I point out, previous Chancellors chose not to publish. Employment is forecast to grow in every year of this Parliament. Total employment is expected to rise from 29.0 million to 30.1 million-that is more than 1 million additional new jobs. On unemployment, thanks to faster than expected growth in the economy, the OBR now expects the rate to be slightly lower this year, at 7.9 per cent instead of 8.1 per cent. Its forecast for the unemployment rate for next year is unchanged from the June Budget, at 8 per cent. For future years, the OBR predicts a gradual decrease in unemployment, with the rate falling every year. By the end of the Parliament, the OBR forecasts that unemployment will fall to just above 6 per cent-that is about half a million fewer unemployed people than at the beginning of this Parliament.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10112928000011"></a>The trend in the claimant count is similar to that for the internationally recognised Labour Force Survey measure of unemployment, but the level is expected to be higher. The OBR explains that this revision is mainly due to a change in the way that flows from employment and support allowance on to jobseeker's allowance as a result of the new work capability assessment are modelled. In other words, more people are assumed to be flowing off ESA and on to JSA. This is a key part of our reforms to create a welfare system that encourages people to seek work and to reduce costs for the taxpayer-in short, we will stop hiding people who can work in the incapacity statistics. Crucially, in each year fewer people are expected to be on both those out-of-work benefits combined than in the June forecast.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10112928000012"></a>I can also tell the House that, following the spending review, the OBR has now recalculated its estimate of the reduction in headcount in the public sector. In June, the OBR forecast a reduction in headcount of 490,000 over the next four years. In its latest forecast, the estimate has come down to 330,000, which is a reduction of 160,000. The bulk of the revision results from the action that we have taken to cut welfare bills rather than to cut public services. Our difficult choices on child benefit, housing benefit and other benefits-each of which were opposed by the party opposite-mean fewer posts will be lost across the public sector. Those headcount reductions that still need to take place will happen over four years, not overnight. The OBR also forecasts that private sector job creation will far outweigh the reduction in public sector employment. As the report says,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10112928000124"></a>"A period of rising total employment alongside falling general government employment is in line with employment trends during the 1990s when total employment increased by 1.3 million over six years while general government employment fell by around half a million".</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10112928000013"></a>However, the most important point is that the lesson of what is happening all around us in Europe is that, unless we deal decisively with the record budget deficit, many thousands more jobs will be at risk in both the private sector and the public sector. Let me summarise the forecast for the public finances, which  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1286"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shows that Britain is decisively dealing with its debts. Borrowing this year is expected to be £1 billion less than we forecast in June. The OBR forecasts that public sector net borrowing will fall from £148.5 billion this year to just £18 billion in 2015-16. Government debt as a share of GDP is projected to peak just below 70 per cent in 2013-14 and then fall to 67 per cent by 2015-16. The debt ratio is now expected to peak at a lower point compared to June-at just below 70 per cent instead of just above it.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10112928000014"></a>On the OBR's central forecast, we will meet our fiscal mandate to eliminate the structural current budget deficit one year early, in 2014-15. The same is true for our target to get debt falling as a percentage of GDP. Indeed, to use the OBR's own words,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10112928000125"></a>"The Government has a slightly wider margin for error in meeting the mandate than appeared likely in June".</p>

<p><a name="10112928000121"></a>For the first time, the OBR has also tested the resilience of the fiscal mandate to two alternative scenarios for the economy that critics have put forward. In both cases the mandate is met. It is clear that our decisive actions have proved to the world that Britain can live within her means. This Government have taken Britain out of the financial danger zone and set our economy on the path to recovery. That is the judgment of not only the OBR but the IMF, the OECD, the European Commission, the Bank of England and all the major business organisations in this country.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10112928000015"></a>Already our efforts are paying off. Today's forecast shows that the cost of servicing the Government's debt has come down. Compared to the June forecast, the OBR predicts that we will save £19 billion in interest payments between now and the end of the forecast period. That is £19 billion that will no longer be paid by British taxpayers to private bondholders and foreign Governments. That is £19 billion that would have been wasted and will be saved instead.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10112928000016"></a>This is an uncertain world, but the British recovery is on track. Employment is growing; 1 million more jobs are being created; and the deficit is set to fall. The plan is working, so we will stick to the course. This is the only way to help confidence to flourish and growth to return. I urge those who, when they see what is happening to our neighbours, seriously suggest that I should abandon the decisive plan that we are following and borrow more and spend more, to think again. What they propose would be disastrous for the British economy. It would put us back in the international firing line from which we have worked so hard to escape. It would mean higher deficits and jobs lost. We should reject that path.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10112928000017"></a>Stability is a necessary pre-condition for growth, but it is not enough. Our economy's competitiveness has been in decline for more than a decade and that has undermined its ability to create jobs and grow. That is why we have already announced: four annual reductions in corporation tax; axing the jobs tax; cutting the small companies rate; expanding the loans scheme; simplifying health and safety laws; investing in science and apprenticeships; and promoting exports through trade missions.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10112928000018"></a>Let me set out some of the other things that my right honourable friend the Business Secretary and I are announcing today to support growth and a rebalancing  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1287"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of our economy. At the Budget, I set out a plan to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 24 per cent-its lowest ever rate-to demonstrate our commitment to tax competitiveness. I can now tell the House that the most significant programme of corporate tax reforms for a generation are today being published for consultation with the business community. We propose to make the UK an even more attractive location for international business and investment by reforming our outdated and complex rules for controlled foreign companies. We have seen a steady stream of companies that have left the UK in recent years. This Government, unlike the previous Government, are not content to sit by and watch our competitiveness leach away and our corporate tax base undermined.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10112928000019"></a>Another tax issue of crucial importance to our corporate sector is the tax treatment of income from intellectual property. For a long time, we have argued that we should increase the incentives to innovate and to develop new products in this country. To encourage high-tech businesses to invest in the UK and to create high-value jobs here, we can confirm that we will introduce from April 2013 a lower 10 per cent corporate tax rate on profits from newly commercialised patents.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10112928000020"></a>We have been consulting with the business community, and I can tell the House that, as a result of that measure, GlaxoSmithKline will today announce: a new £500 million investment programme in the UK to manufacture a newly developed respiratory device at Ware in Hertfordshire; the launch of a new £50 million venture capital fund to invest in healthcare research; the construction of a new facility at the University of Nottingham to develop "green chemistry" technology; and the building of Glaxo's next biopharmaceutical plant in this country, with sites in Northern England and Scotland being considered. In total, GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 1,000 new jobs will be created in the UK over the lifetime of those projects.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10112928000021"></a>Today, we also launch a cross-government growth review. This will be a determined, forensic examination of how every part of Government can do more to remove barriers to growth and support new growth opportunities. Too often the natural inclination of Governments is in the opposite direction: creating new regulations; putting up new barriers; and making life more difficult for entrepreneurs and innovators. We are starting to turn the super-tanker around. Together with the Business Department, the Treasury will lead an intensive programme of work that will involve all parts of Government and use evidence provided by the business community and that will report by next year's Budget. We will identify cross-cutting reform priorities that can benefit the whole economy. Specific priority will be given to: improvements to the planning system and employment law; more support for exporters and inward investors; and reforms to the competition regime. At the same time, we will begin a new sector-by-sector focus on removing barriers to growth and opening up new opportunities. Some of the resulting changes will be substantive on their own; others will in very specific ways help particular industries. Some may be controversial if they confront vested interests. However, brick by brick, we will remove the barriers that are holding Britain back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10112928000022"></a>Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the international assistance package for Ireland. I attended the Europeans meetings in Brussels yesterday. We agreed a three-year package for Ireland worth €85 billion, which,</p>
<ul><a name="10112928000133"></a>"is warranted to safeguard financial stability in the euro area and the EU as a whole".</ul>
<p><a name="10112928000023"></a>Of that, €35 billion will be used to support Ireland's banking sector, with €10 billion going towards immediate bank recapitalisation, and €50 billion will be used for sovereign debt support. Ireland will contribute €17.5 billion towards the total package and the remaining €67.5 billion will be split, with one third coming from the IMF, one third from the European financial stability mechanism and one third from bilateral loans and the eurozone facility. The terms of the IMF loan will be determined over the coming weeks.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10112928000024"></a>In principle, our bilateral loan is for £3.25 billion and we will expect the loan to be denominated in sterling. The rate of interest on the loan will be similar to the rates levied by the IMF and the eurozone. This loan to Ireland is in Britain's national interest. It will help one of our closest economic partners manage through these difficult conditions. I should also tell the House that the eurozone Finance Ministers-without me present-discussed a permanent financial stability facility. I have made it clear in the subsequent ECOFIN meeting that the UK will not be part of that. The president of the euro group made it clear that the UK will not be part of the permanent bail-out mechanism and that the European financial stability mechanism, agreed under the previous Government in May and of which we are part, will cease to exist when that permanent eurozone mechanism is put in place.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10112928000025"></a>Mr Speaker, when we came into office, Britain was in the financial danger zone. Our economy was unstable, our public finances out of control and our country on the international watch-list to avoid. We took decisive action. Now the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has confirmed that the British recovery is on track, our public finances are under control, a million jobs are set to be created and our economy is rebalancing. Today we take further measures to secure growth and create prosperity. We do so based on the foundation of stability that we have now secured. Britain is on the mend. I commend this Statement to the House."</p>

<a name="10112928000026"></a><b><a name="101129-0001.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="10112928000144"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place. I agree entirely with him that there is a refreshingly independent tone to the OBR report. However, the Chancellor's Statement is old-fashioned spin and I shall try to untwist it a little.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10112928000027"></a>The Autumn Statement embodies a wide range of forecasts on aspects of the UK economy, on fiscal performance and on sustainability-a matter to which I will return later. However, as the Statement makes clear, once we attempt to forecast performance beyond two or three years, considerable uncertainty intrudes. For example, while the OBR suggests that there is a 50 per cent probability of the growth rate in 2014  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1289"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being 2.8 per cent-the figure that the noble Lord quoted with certainty-it is also noted that there is a 10 per cent probability of growth being zero in that year and a 20 per cent probability of growth being zero or less.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10112928000028"></a>This might be regarded as a little worrying, but it is, after all, four years on. Far more worrying is the fact that the OBR finds that there is a 20 per cent probability of growth being zero or less next year. So, to be reasonably safe, leaving aside these longer-term forecasts, let us focus on the current year and next year. Or, to put the matter in political terms, the year of Labour policies and the year of coalition policies, for the obvious reason that coalition policies can have had no significant effect on 2010, but will certainly start to have an effect on 2011.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10112928000029"></a>So what does the OBR say about 2010, the year of Labour policies? Two factors stand out. First, in every forecast made by the OBR since the pre-Budget forecast of early June, the outturn in the economy has been significantly better than was forecast by my right honourable friend Alistair Darling in his March Budget. Growth has been steadily revised upwards and the deficit downwards-down now by a full one percentage point of GDP. These OBR results give the lie to the Minister's persistent mantra that the situation that the Government found on taking office was worse than expected. In fact, month after month it has been consistently better than was expected in March. Let us hear no more of that fiction, and let us hear no more sneering from the Chancellor about my right honourable friend's political forecasts. As the OBR itself made clear in its press release in June, Mr Darling was in fact overly cautious, a truth that has been borne out by subsequent data.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10112928000030"></a>Now let us turn to what the OBR has to say about coalition policies. In June the OBR forecast what the impact would have been if we had just left Labour's Budget in place for the next five years. Today we have the OBR forecast for the impact of coalition policies, and what do we find? In 2011, growth is down. In 2012, growth is down. By 2014, the coalition has at last caught up with the Labour growth rates-but then, four years hence, who knows what extra follies it will have committed?</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10112928000031"></a>Before turning to some wider economic issues in the Autumn Statement, I want to ask the Minister a couple of more technical points about the document. First, in paragraph 3.5 on page 27, and indeed elsewhere, the OBR makes it clear that the fan charts that the Minister referred to, which express the probability of particular outcomes, do,</p>
<ul><a name="10112928000134"></a>"not represent our subjective assessment of the specific upside and downside risks that we see to this forecast".</ul>
<p><a name="10112928000122"></a>Why not? Why are we presented, in this long and important document, with an assessment of risks to the economy that the OBR does not actually believe? Is the hidden assessment of downside risk greater than that set out in the Autumn Statement? Surely we have a right to know.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10112928000032"></a>Secondly, the OBR notes in paragraph 4.124 on page 119 that the estimates of the Government's fiscal position do not include the likely impact of the sale of shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Why not? Surely, given the enthusiasm  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1290"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with which the OBR has graphed analyses of uncertainty, some probability could be assigned to a central estimate of receipts from such sales. Perhaps the Minister will give us his estimate of such receipts and the impact on the overall deficit programme.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10112928000033"></a>Thirdly, and most importantly, since it is an important part of the mandate of the OBR, is its consideration of long-term fiscal sustainability. In this consideration, starting at paragraph 5.27 on page 140, the OBR concludes that government policies imply a long-term budget surplus year after year of 2.1 per cent of GDP. This simply cannot be right. If the balance of payments is roughly zero or, as over the past decade, shows a deficit of about 1 per cent of GDP, then a long-term budget surplus of 2.1 per cent means that private sector debt is being accumulated at over 3 per cent of GDP a year-just the sort of private sector debt accumulation that brought about the recent crisis. Is this what the Government define as sustainability? This is truly an economy built on debt.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10112928000034"></a>I am particularly worried about that point, as it echoes the Government's fundamental misunderstanding of what has happened to fiscal balances over the past three years. That should be corrected by the OBR analysis in box 3.3, which shows that the fiscal deficit growth was directly linked to a sharp increase in savings in the corporate and household sectors. If government spending had not offset that increase in savings, the fall in output would have been truly calamitous.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10112928000035"></a>A key element in the estimates in the Autumn Statement is the Government's shift of spending cuts, as the Minister noted, from departmental spending to the welfare budget; this is clearly spelt out in table 4.16. Does the Minister agree that there is to be a cumulative reduction in DWP benefit payments of £9.1 billion over the next five years and a reduction in child benefit of a cumulative £7.9 billion over the next five years? This Government are attempting to balance the budget by squeezing the poor and by squeezing children.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10112928000036"></a>We will await with interest the Government's review of corporation tax. If I may be given the indulgence of making a forecast, the Government will find it far more difficult to simplify rules on controlled foreign companies than they might expect. But when do the Government expect the results of the review to be announced?</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10112928000037"></a>We on this side are delighted that the Government have announced a cross-cutting government growth review-about time too. Perhaps it will involve somewhat smaller cuts in investment-in public investment-than the Government currently plan. But what has actually been announced today? The only substantial announcement in this document is the investment programme by GlaxoSmithKline, which everybody welcomes. Everything else consists of rhetorical promises. When will we have a concrete growth strategy to replace this wishful thinking? When will the Government publish their long-awaited growth White Paper?</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10112928000038"></a>We on this side of the House welcome the financial assistance to the Republic of Ireland. It is certainly late; let us hope that it is sufficient. I was, however, a little puzzled by when the Chancellor said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10112928000126"></a>"In principle our bilateral loan is for £3.25 billion..."</p>

<p><a name="10112928000039"></a>What does "in principle" mean in this context?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10112928000040"></a>What is made clear by this Autumn Statement is that there is as yet no sign whatever that the Government's gamble of cutting living standards for the next three years is going to pay off. The policies that underpinned a solid recovery this year are being put into reverse. It is the poor who are paying the price.</p>

We have always said that the recovery is going to be gradual. It is on track. The recovery and the economy are borne down because they have to bear the legacy of the unbalanced growth and the excessive debt that was left behind by the previous Government. The noble Lord does not look forward; he is not grateful for the fact that the OBR has confirmed in its independent forecast that we have a pattern of rising employment in each year of the forecast. Instead, he continually wants to chip away at techie points around the way that the forecast has been produced. The transparency and the information have been vastly increased-and he chips away at it. Well, fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10112928000042"></a>I am grateful that the noble Lord welcomes, as we all do, the £500 million new investment announced today, and I am sure that there will be a lot more to come. I was up in the north-west of England on Friday talking to a great sweep of businesses from some of the largest multinationals, like Siemens, through to very regional businesses like the Blackpool leisure centre, to family businesses such as the business that puts together Chevron motor cars. I do not recognise the picture that the noble Lord paints. These businesses are looking to the future. They recognise that there is a lot of rebalancing of the economy to do, but they are producing world-class science; the Daresbury science and innovation centre is one of the world's great leaders. It was thanks to the foresight of the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, under the previous Government, that that project got going. The current Government have just announced a public-private partnership to take forward that project for the next 20 years, creating, on that one science park alone, 6,000 jobs. This is the view of Britain that I see when I get out and about, and which seems to be in no way reflected in the technical analysis of the noble Lord and some of his friends opposite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10112928000043"></a>The noble Lord talks about the fan charts. Well, we have not had the fan charts before; we now have them. He can do the analysis; he can see that the OBR has produced upside and downside scenarios. As I have said, the different scenarios that were suggested to the OBR-not its own scenarios-show that under them the fiscal mandate will be met. Yes, we have taken radical steps on welfare reform. Yes, it is correct that, by doing what we did to take more people out of welfare, we have been able to protect many more front-line public service jobs. That welfare reform is not about anything other than protecting the poor and getting a fair deal for this country. We must have a welfare system in which families who choose to go out to work are able to earn and retain more than families

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10112928000044"></a>The noble Lord talked about cuts in investment. As he may remember, when we discussed the spending review only a few weeks ago, we increased the amount of money going into public sector investment in economically enhancing infrastructure by more than £2 billion a year through the spending review period, compared to what was in the Budget and what we inherited from the previous Government. I am grateful for the work of the OBR in producing this forecast. It confirms that the judgments that my right honourable friend the Chancellor made are absolutely right. In the 2011 Budget we will update on our progress.</p>

Having said that, I raise the position with regard to Ireland. Many people in this House believed that it was right to make Ireland a special case, but can we be sure that it is a special case and we will not find ourselves bailing out other eurozone countries to prevent their defaulting? Is it not the case that the Irish, having been bailed out, would be better able to achieve economic growth in the future if they were no longer in the euro? The reality is that the euro was designed to prevent members leaving by eliminating their own currencies. However, we need to provide some form of escape route for those countries-not only Ireland but the others on the periphery-that continue to suffer because they have an inappropriate exchange rate. Perhaps some form of alternative currency, to be used when a country wishes to withdraw, ought to be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10112928000047"></a>In respect of Ireland and the eurozone, I can confirm that the UK will not be part of the permanent bail-out mechanism that the eurozone will put in place. Having said that, I do not wish to speculate about the future of the eurozone, which is very important to the UK. Europe accounts for 40 per cent of our trade and it is in the interests of this country to do what it can to support the stability of the eurozone. That does not mean that, with the exception of Ireland and its particular circumstances, we will directly support any bail-out operation.</p>

They said that they would happen as long as we did not cut too deeply or too fast. That is what the previous Government said. The growth figures in the first seven months of this Government are down to the previous Government's policies and the general policies within industry. The Minister might care to remember-as I pointed out a number of times when I was sat on that side of the House-that British manufacturing output was growing and that we were the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world. At the same time, French manufacturing was in decline. At the same time, President Sarkozy has expressed concern that the French might have trouble with their triple A rating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10112928000049"></a>It is also not true to say that this is the largest deficit in peacetime history. Simply typing "history of the national debt" into any search engine, or going to the library, will tell him that national debt in peacetime, as a percentage of GDP, was significantly higher through most of the 19th century-it was the way we financed the Empire-and much of the 20th century. Indeed, it was only the previous Labour Government who paid off the final debt from the Napoleonic wars and the Second World War. Can the Minister now tell us why he thinks that cutting faster and deeper in the coming year will help when we are already recovering? In a year's time he will not be able to carry on the political, or party propaganda, line that somehow or other in seven months the Government have turned it round. They have not. That was already happening. What matters is the next 12 months.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Soley, now talks about the strength of the economy this year as being down to the previous Government's policies. I remind noble Lords of what the OBR says about the reason why growth is now forecast by it to be much stronger in 2010 than had been previously forecast. It is principally down to the confidence of industry in restocking. That position has changed in its forecasts since June. I wonder where that confidence comes from. It comes from the fact that we came in in May and took immediate and decisive action to get the economy under control, which has resulted in British business restocking because it knows that sustained growth is coming. Let us stopping going on about this and celebrate the fact that the growth is there and that industry has the confidence to understand precisely that.</p>

However, because of the numbers-much reduced in the latest forecasts-of public sector workers who will lose their jobs, not overnight but over the next four or five years, interventions that we have already announced, such as the £1.4 billion regional growth fund, are so important.

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10112928000079"></a>I am aware that the coalition Government have ambitious plans to be the greenest Government ever. The coalition agreement itself has specific commitments to tackling climate change, protecting wildlife and a series of environ1mental objectives alongside the objectives of economic prosperity and fairness in social policy-all the components of sustainable development. The Minister and I had many happy discussions on sustainable development in the previous Parliament, when we occupied different roles.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10112928000080"></a>In July this year, the Secretary of State for Defra, Caroline Spelman, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10112928000128"></a>"This Government are committed to sustainable development and to becoming the greenest Government ever, promoting economic development, environmental protection and an improving quality of life for everyone in the UK".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/7/10; col. <I>WS 83</I>.]</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10112928000082"></a>Many of the bodies listed in this Bill have a range of generic and specific duties or policy commitments that are there to safeguard the general public interest. The risk across a range of such duties and commitments is that these safeguards will be removed as functions are transferred to a range of companies, community interest companies, charities, other unincorporated organisations or persons, even indeed to government departments. The purpose of this amendment is to safeguard the public interest in one respect-sustainable development.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10112928000083"></a>The danger is that this Bill, and its operation, will result in this and other safeguards being written out or restricted by the constitution or viewpoint of the body or person that is taking over the functions. It is easy to think of a lot of examples. Somewhere functions may be transferred to perfectly good organisations with perfectly desirable objectives. For example, should the management of Natural England's national nature reserves, or some of them, be outsourced to other conservation bodies, it is entirely foreseeable that future management arrangements might consider not other environmental outcomes but merely the contribution that national nature reserves might make to the very narrow area of nature conservation. It is appropriate, however, that other outcomes ought to include those which Natural England would consider at the moment, such as the contribution reserves could make to local economies and social outcomes-for example, enhancing the health of local people through increased provision of health walks, which may well contribute to better physical and mental health among the people taking part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10112928000087"></a>In Schedule 1, there are a number of bodies which can significantly affect the environment: the Commission for Rural Communities, the Environment Protection Advisory Committees, the regional and local fisheries advisory committees and the various regional development agencies. In Schedule 3, there are the internal drainage boards and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In Schedule 4, there is the Marine Management Organisation. In Schedule 5, there are the internal drainage boards. I select those merely at random; there are many more. For the avoidance of doubt, it would be a safeguard to include the amendment.</p>

I recall the days when the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was standing here and urging the Government to do better. He now has an opportunity to show that he is consistent in taking this message into government.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10112928000089"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has pinpointed a potential weakness in the construct of the Bill. Noble Lords will know that the Bill allows a Minister by order under Clause 1 to transfer a function that is being abolished to an eligible person. The definition of eligible person includes in Clause 1(3)(a) to (e) companies limited by guarantee, community interest companies or a body of trustees or other unincorporated body of persons. Subsequent clauses extend the ability of Ministers to transfer functions of bodies listed in Schedules 2 to 7.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10112928000090"></a>It would be helpful to know the criteria under which functions of public bodies might be transferred-in particular, to companies or unincorporated bodies of people. So little information is available. The impact assessment is distinguished by its inability to give any figures whatsoever for the financing consequences of the Bill. In particular, the Bill and the Explanatory Notes are silent about how desirable government policies will be transferred when those functions are transferred  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1300"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to companies or to unincorporated bodies of people. Sustainable development is a very good illustration of the point. We are told that the current Government are taking forward desirable policies on sustainability. Those policies relate not just to central Government but to local government and to other public bodies. Many of the organisations listed in Schedules 1 to 7 would be expected to enact the general principles of government policy on sustainability.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10112928000091"></a>If those functions are now to be transferred outside the public domain into companies or into unincorporated groups of individuals, the question arises: how do we ensure that sustainability issues will be carried forward? How will that be monitored, or are the Government saying that, once a function has been transferred outwith the public sector, they are washing their hands of it and there is no guarantee that sustainability issues will be carried forward? That is an important debate.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10112928000093"></a>This amendment seeks to add a further requirement that when functions are transferred from one body to another, the duty to promote sustainable development transfers along with the function, whether or not the duty is set out in statute. I am happy to confirm to my noble friend Lord Greaves that the Government absolutely share his desire to make sustainable development a key part of public life and a consideration that runs through everything we do.</p>

I cannot refer to a television programme which I have not seen, so it would be best if I were allowed to move on by stating the general principle that underlines our approach to this amendment. I consider it to be useful because it does indeed give us the opportunity to debate the issue of sustainability within the context of this Bill. No doubt it will arise when we come to further issues and parts of the schedules.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10112928000098"></a>Where we differ from the amendment is how we go about achieving this important objective. We believe this amendment would go further and potentially add unnecessary bureaucratic hoops through which some public bodies will have to jump. It is a general and not a specific requirement to those bodies which already have a sustainability requirement. We do not want public bodies to get distracted by having constantly to prove to us that they are delivering sustainable development. We expect it of them. We do not necessarily expect them to be saying that they are doing it all the time. We want them to get on with delivering their core functions in a sustainable way.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10112928000099"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked specifically about when private companies are involved in delivering a service that is currently undertaken by a public body. It is up to the relevant Minister in charge to determine how much they will be held to account, for example by attaching conditions to the contract or funding agreement. It is then for that Minister to account to Parliament and the public for such decisions. This reform programme is about making public bodies more accountable and more efficient.</p>

This is our problem with debating this Bill. The powers that it gives to Ministers are so draconian that all of these functions could find themselves in the private sector in one way or another.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10112928000101"></a>The Minister is saying that we should not worry because it will be up to each Minister to decide whether in any contractual situation they may or may not put something in about sustainability. But does he accept that our problem is that that gives far too much control to Ministers and that parliamentary oversight is very limited?</p>

If Ministers do not perform how Parliament expects, it is up to Parliament to make that clear. I have no difficulty with this. It is about making Ministers accountable for the conduct of the public sector. We want to mainstream sustainable development so that it is not a bolt-on option, but integral to everything that public bodies do. But we are committed to doing it on a non-statutory basis. For that reason, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="10112928000123"></a>only where it is appropriate. That would seem to allow the avoidance of the kind of tiresome debate that he has adumbrated in the early part of his remarks. This would be just a safeguard, a safety net. From that point of view, it could be a helpful addition to the Bill.</p>

I understand exactly what noble Lords are saying from all sides of the House, but for a Government committed to building sustainability into all their activities, there is no need to make it explicit. It is implicit in all that this Government are doing.</p>

But the debate which has taken place on this amendment-I thank everyone who has taken part-comes to the core of a major flaw in the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, suggested. Sustainable development is just one example of the safeguards written in countless reams of legislation relating to the bodies listed in the schedules to this Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10112928000106"></a>The Minister said that I am trying to make one further requirement: I am tempted to say that I am trying to make a requirement. As the Bill is set out, there are few clear legislative requirements for when functions are transferred from existing bodies to other bodies, whether they are existing bodies being closed down or they are just being run down and having some of their functions transferred.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10112928000107"></a>There was a slight diversion in the discussion about national parks. Indeed, national parks are one of the important areas to be included in our discussions about the particular bodies affected by this Bill. I do not want to pre-empt that debate, except to say that it is very good that the Defra Minister, my noble friend Lord Henley, will take part in that debate. Finding out exactly what the Government intend for national parks will be a crucial part of the scrutiny of this Bill. I thank the Government and my noble friend Lord Henley for that. No doubt my noble friend Lord Taylor is rather pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, will be taking part in it. There is no doubt that national parks authorities are in the process of selling off or leasing out property for other people to manage. I raise the issue of the Losehill educational centre in the Peak District near Castleton. The national parks authority is considering proposals by people who are willing to buy it and take it over. So there is a certain amount of selling-off going on as a result of reduced budgets and there is a great deal of concern and alarm over Losehill, but that is a diversion from this debate.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10112928000108"></a>The Minister said, "It is about making public bodies more accountable and more efficient". I am sorry the previous group of amendments was not moved because accountability is crucial here. If functions are being moved to the private sector in some cases-</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10112928000111"></a>This amendment is about keeping some of the safeguards which exist in legislative form in relation to some of the bodies listed. There are many more safeguards of different sorts which are in legislative form at the moment. One of the real concerns over this Bill is the process by which Parliament will be able to scrutinise and the Government will be accountable to Parliament in the discussion of whether these safeguards are going to remain. Ministers are indeed accountable to Parliament, but ministerial accountability to Parliament at the Dispatch Box, when we can ask questions and raise debates and so on, is rather different from legislation written down in the statues of the land, in the law of England, which can, if necessary, be challenged in court. It is a different sort of accountability if people are responsible to the courts of the land for following the laws which have been set down by Parliament. It is in many ways a much more robust form of accountability and we are concerned that it is going to go if, as the Minister says, the Government prefer that all this is done on a non-statutory basis. The ministerial orders which will be responsible for making a lot of the changes proposed to the organisations set out in the schedules are in themselves legislation. To suggest that a lot of it will be non-statutory suggests that those orders will not contain these safeguards, and that, too, is a major concern.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10112928000112"></a>These are important issues which go beyond the particular issue of sustainable development and I am sure they will come up again and again as we continue to debate this Bill. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is a very miscellaneous group and I think we can discern four or five categories. For example, there are some bodies that are for straight abolition, and British Shipbuilders would fall into that category. There is  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then a second category where the powers, functions and duties will revert back to Ministers or to departmental civil servants. Then there is a third category where the powers, functions and duties are being transferred in whole or in part to another public body. And there is yet a further category where powers, functions and duties are being transferred in whole or in part to a private body, for example Consumer Focus to Citizens Advice. Then there are some like the Security Industry Authority-I declare an interest as chairman of that body-where the powers, functions and duties are going eventually, via phased transition, to a private body but with a residual public function.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10112928000114"></a>When my noble friend Lord Whitty and I were looking to try to devise an amendment, we could not allocate these different bodies to the different categories without naming each one of them, which we found impossible to do. That is why, as I say, this is a probing amendment. Does the Minster recognise that there are different consequences, not least for Parliament, of the different intentions for bodies in Schedule 1? I am asking for these to be spelt out in the Bill because they materially affect what is going to happen to these different bodies.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10112928000115"></a>On Amendment 11, my noble friend Lord Whitty was looking to delete "other incorporated body" as an eligible body to transfer into on the grounds that he found it too wide and too unaccountable in terms of its range. So the gist of these amendments is to try to get some coherence and recognise that different bodies should be dealt with in different ways. I beg to move.</p>

As we have already briefly debated, Clause 1(3) is very important because it specifies which bodies and functions can be transferred from the bodies listed in the schedules. My noble friend is, first, seeking clarity and then, importantly, asking the Government questions, particularly about their ability to transfer functions to an unincorporated body of persons.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10112928000117"></a>I find it surprising that the noble Lord is proposing to give himself power to give such functions to a group of unincorporated persons. It would be helpful if he could explain under what circumstances this could happen and what safeguards would be in place. In a sense we are following on from our previous debate. Will the accounts of such organisations come under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor-General? Will freedom of information or data protection legislation apply to the same extent as when functions are delivered in the public sector? Potentially all the functions carried out by all the bodies listed in these schedules could be transferred to such bodies. My own view and that of the Opposition is that those powers are far too open-ended. The noble Lord has said that in the end accountability is to Parliament, and that is so. However, the problem we have, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has spotted, is that it is likely that even when we have orders, they will in themselves give considerable discretion to Ministers in their dealings with the functions that are encompassed by the bodies listed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10112928000118"></a>When it comes to the orders, we have another problem. We have the Cunningham committee's report on conventions. We debated that in Question Time

But the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, will know that the conclusion of the Cunningham convention in relation to this House seeking to defeat secondary legislation is now disputed by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the House, in correspondence between himself and the Merits Select Committee which has been published in the past few weeks. So we are not even sure at this stage whether the Government even accept that it is the right of this House to vote to seek to defeat the Government on secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10112928000119"></a>Behind the amendment moved by my noble friend lies a real concern about the draconian powers being given to Ministers and a doubt whether the kind of parliamentary scrutiny currently envisaged in this Bill is sufficient to ensure proper discharge of ministerial accountability to Parliament.</p>

Is it the Minister's understanding that if these functions are transferred to a company limited by guarantee, for example, judicial review in the courts would apply to the exercise of those functions by such a body, and would the Human Rights Act apply where appropriate to the content of any decision taken by such a body? This is of obvious importance because if the answer is no to either of those matters, the very important safeguards that exist when the functions are exercised by public bodies would be lost.</p>

I have to admit that I am puzzled by these amendments. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to bring forward over time specific and detailed proposals on each of these bodies and to put those proposals in front of Parliament. A huge prize can be won by enabling this process to be conducted as quickly and effectively as possible. If we try to box the Government in by defining all the proposals up front and limiting the scope of what the answers might be, we complicate the process in a way that will make it impossible for the Government to bring forward those proposals one by one and to have the debate around them that each will require. These amendments are self-defeating because, in trying to put the cart before the horse by asking the Government to specify what they want to do before bringing forward the detailed proposals, they would limit the Government's scope for action.</p>

However, a similar regulator, the Office of Rail Regulation, is on a list, and I shall speak to that in a later amendment. I am sorry; Ofcom is on the list set out in Schedule 7. Given the amount of legislative time it has taken over the years to set up these organisations, it seems a bit odd for the noble Lord to suggest that it is all right for them to be abolished, changed or whatever by secondary legislation without any debate.</p>

It and the amendments grouped with it raise interesting aspects of the Bill and I am grateful for the debate that has taken place. They concern the definition of an eligible person in Clause 1, and the ability of Ministers to transfer functions to persons so defined. Perhaps I can best help by saying that when we come to the debates about the different bodies, I will debate in some detail their functions and where they are going, as well as the nature of the changes that will be involved. I am sure that we will have every opportunity to do this.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10112931000006"></a>Amendment 7A would remove Clause 1(2) and replace it with a new subsection that allowed for the transfer of functions to a Minister in the UK Government or the devolved Administrations, or to an eligible person. Amendment 9 would remove subsection (3)(a), thereby removing Ministers from the list of eligible persons under subsection (3). However, Ministers would still be covered by the proposed amended definition in subsection 3(b) of,</p>
<ul><a name="10112931000083"></a>"any other person exercising public functions".</ul>
<p><a name="10112931000077"></a>So, taken together, these amendments would have no real substantive effect on the Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10112931000007"></a>Amendment 11 would remove unincorporated bodies, other than bodies of trustees, from the list of eligible persons under subsection (3). This amendment would prevent the transfer of functions to a variety of organisations, such as unincorporated partnerships. Perhaps I may illustrate this in a way that might particularly interest the noble Lord, Lord Liddle. I refer to the transfer of the regional development agencies to the local enterprise partnership structure, and the way in which that might function. The impact of Amendment 7A would be far wider because it would remove the option for Ministers to transfer any public function to an unincorporated body regardless of the nature and scope of the policy intent. I do not believe that this is a desirable outcome because it would risk ruling out a range of innovative approaches to the delivery of public functions. Our specific intention for the transfer of functions from RDAs is that local enterprise partnerships should be free to adopt the arrangements that suit them best as part of our move towards more locally driven, targeted approaches to growth.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10112931000008"></a>I know that we will have an opportunity to talk about this in detail as a policy when we come to the debates on those bodies, but the amendment would remove the option to form an unincorporated partnership, and would go further by limiting options for public bodies reform in general. So, from that point of view, we resist the amendment because it goes to the heart of some of the changes that we are proposing.</p>

<a name="101129-0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10112931000009"></a>Finally, Amendment 16A seeks to require that when a Minister lays an order under the powers in the Bill, the order names the eligible person to which any

We do not believe that it is necessary to include such a provision in the Bill as the orders and the accompanying explanatory material, which has already been the subject of various amendments in Committee, would give this information as a matter of course. Indeed, the provision of such information would be covered by the proposed requirement to provide, as part of the explanatory material, the reasoning for the order.</p>

I think that by the time we have gone through a number of debates on individual bodies, noble Lords may well have quite a substantial idea of the pattern that the orders may well form. I hope to be able to provide noble Lords with the background to a lot of the changes that are anticipated by this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10112931000012"></a>Perhaps I may respond to some specific points. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt-it might have been the noble Lord, Lord Pannick-asked about audit. Where public bodies are retained as a result of the 2010 review process, and in particular where functions have been transferred to them from other bodies, I assure the Committee that they will continue to be subject to the existing requirements for accounting, reporting, and data confidentiality issues. NDPBs are required to have in place robust governance and accountability arrangements, and both the Cabinet Office and the Treasury provide detailed guidance on the matter. Published annual reports and accounts are the main vehicle by which departments and public bodies regularly inform Parliament and the public about their activities and expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10112931000013"></a>On freedom of information, I further reassure the House that where bodies already subject to the Freedom of Information Act are merged to form new arm's-length bodies that are established by and at least partly constituted by appointments made to government, steps will be taken to ensure that they fall within its scope. Where a body's functions are transferred to another body that is already subject to the Act, they will naturally be subject to that Act.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10112931000028"></a>The issue is the broader subject of the future of economic regeneration policy-regional development policy-and we will obviously have a political debate about this when we come to Schedule 1. Several of us will move amendments to delete from the schedule the abolition of the regional development agencies. That is not the purpose of this set of amendments, however, which assume we will be largely unsuccessful. They are basically about the architecture of the scene on that assumption.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10112931000029"></a>The point of Amendment 12 is basically that the local enterprise partnerships that are being set up should be one of the "eligible persons" to whom functions can be transferred in this situation. At the moment there is a lot of concern out there that these bodies are being set up without assets, money or any clear role. This is an opportunity for the Government to clarify that they intend them to have clear functions and that they will be taking powers to transfer functions to them. This is therefore an opportunity to help the Government to reassure people that this is the case.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1310"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10112931000030"></a>Secondly, the Government have said that their policy in this area is motivated by localism and that they want to ensure that there is more local control over these things. They have painted the regional development agencies as a top-down new Labour monstrosity that was not really the localist solution favoured by the coalition Government. Amendment 16 basically states that if one accepts that that is the motivation-of course, I am willing to give the Government the benefit of the doubt if that proves to be the case-then surely the Government should transfer the functions of the abolished RDAs to local bodies within the region rather than centralising them.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10112931000031"></a>Again, the fear is that many of the officials who never liked the setting up of the RDAs in the first place will grab back these powers to the centre: that they have taken advantage of the feeling of localism that inspired the Government's proposals and have said, "Right, we shall take back to the centre many of these functions". I do not think that that is what the Government intended, and the purpose of Amendment 16 is to prevent the Government from centralising these functions and to keep them at a regional or local level. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10112931000033"></a>I hope that the Minister will think a little more about the constitutional issues. In reality, the RDA in the north-east was not imposed from London. Way back in, I think, 1987 or 1988, my noble friend Lord Radice put forward in a Private Member's Bill in the other place the idea of establishing a regional body in the north-east. There was much pressure at that time within the region for such a body to deal with economic matters and regeneration. At that stage, we were going through the end of ship-building in the north-east and-as I knew all too well-the closure of steelworks. We also knew that we were coming to the end of the coal-mining industry-thereby hangs a tale, but I shall not go there-so the body was created in the region but it also received the support of the then Conservative Government. The RDA in the north-east started in a totally different way from the other RDAs, as it was started through local enthusiasm and commitment to the region as a whole, which is a very small region in comparison to the rest of the country.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10112931000034"></a>Amendment 16 deals with an important issue, given the fear in the north-east that some of the critical decisions will now go to the body that is to be chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine. The Government-and I shall make these arguments later as the Bill progresses-are making a huge mistake in the north-east. It is simply not true to say that people there want the RDA to be broken up. I listened carefully to the Minister last week when he said that the idea had come before the election from discussions that his party were involved in with business. In the north-east, that was not the message that business was giving. However, I shall say much more on that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10112931000035"></a>In reality, the RDA in the north-east came from the locality, was acknowledged by the Minister's party when it was previously in government and has continued and fitted into the structure and architecture that my party introduced after it came into government in 1997. There is great fear and anxiety about the new architecture but, whatever the architecture is, the north-east will work with it-even if we think it a mistake-because we want the best for the people and industry in the region. However, we wish to make sure that decisions-particularly on some of the bigger projects-stay local and are not taken into the national body that the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, will chair. I hope that the Minister can give us that reassurance through these probing amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10112931000037"></a>Today's debate is quite significant in terms of the problems of the north-east. This morning, I read that Durham University Business School has produced a report for the soon-to-be-abolished One North East that suggests alarming implications for the region. The report refers to 50,000 jobs being lost in the near future, 20,000 of which will be in the private sector, with a loss of £2 billion to the regional economy over the next few years. The report has provoked the chairman of the development agency-a leading private sector businessman in the region who hails from Sunderland-to renew his criticism of the current trend of government policy. It is clear that he is very critical of the decision to abolish the agency and that the private sector in the region, for the most part, wishes the agency to continue. If the current policy is maintained, of course that will not happen.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10112931000038"></a>In addition to those serious concerns, there is another issue that could be partly addressed by an amendment along the lines of Amendment 16, which seeks to require that,</p>
<ul><a name="10112931000084"></a>"the 'eligible person' to which functions are transferred must be located within the region".</ul>
<p><a name="10112931000078"></a>I invite the Minister to agree that if Amendment 16 is accepted-and even if it is not-the same principle could be applied to the assets built up by the agency within the region. When I asked a Written Question about that recently, I received an answer that I would say was remarkable for its opacity if it were not, I am afraid, characteristic of most of the Written Answers that I and other noble Lords receive. Referring to the White Paper on local growth, the Written Answer stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10112931000082"></a>"As set out in the White Paper ... RDA assets and liabilities will be transferred or disposed of in line with a clear set of principles which include a key aim of achieving the best possible outcome for the region consistent with achieving value for the public purse".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/11/10; col. <I>WA 286</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="10112931000079"></a>However, the White Paper states that the principal criteria will be,</p>
<ul><a name="10112931000085"></a>"that a reasonable balance is reached as part of disposal/transfer between national deficit reduction, national policy aims and local ambitions/opportunity".</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10112931000039"></a>I hope that the Minister will give a clearer indication that the proceeds of any asset disposal-if assets are indeed to be disposed of, although they may well be better retained within the portfolio of agencies or other bodies that survive the abolition of the RDAs-should be directed to the region to which they have made a significant contribution over the years. The regions will be desperately in need of those, to judge by the report published by One North East today.</p>

I am aware that we will discuss regional development agencies in their own right not much further along in the Bill-at least, not much further down the page-so I will reserve most of what I want to say for that time. However, we have to see the amendments and the future-or non-future-of RDAs and where their functions are going to go in the context of what will, in effect, be the destruction or removal of the entire regional tier of government in this country. That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but things will be very different from what they are now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10112931000041"></a>In my view, this decision has been made from a very south-east of England perspective. People tell me that, given London's governance arrangements nowadays with the mayor and the London Assembly, a regional development agency in London is redundant. I can understand that. People also tell me that the regions that have been created and drawn on a map in the south-east make no sense whatsoever. In any case, it is not clear why a regional development agency is needed in a part of the country that, at least to those of us who live in the north of England and other distant parts of the realm, appears to be relatively prosperous compared with the regions in which we live.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10112931000042"></a>There may be a question as to whether a uniform pattern of regional government is required across the country, but what is-and always has been-clear is that some level of regional government, or governance, in the northern regions is essential. We now face the position in which, not very far to the north, Scotland has its own Parliament, which has an increasingly federal relationship with the rest of the UK. Scotland is able to make decisions for itself and, clearly, can attract and create investment in a way in which we cannot. The idea that Yorkshire, however you define its exact boundaries, and the north-west of England-never mind the north-east, about which other noble Lords have spoken eloquently-are not regions in their own right with an important role to play in economic development in particular and in a series of regional associations, and in regional provision of services of many kinds, seems to me to be nonsense.</p>

Some of us who live perhaps in the fringe areas of the north-west get very uptight about what we see as the attempted dominance of the region by Manchester and Liverpool as Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Nevertheless, no one who lives in the north-west would deny that they live in the north-west, which is a clearly understood and accepted

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10112931000044"></a>I am all in favour of decentralisation and devolution within the region, but whether the local economic partnerships-which I hope will be set up in all areas, although we have not got them in Lancashire yet-will be the answer is a matter that we will need to see in future. If we are not careful, we could end up with a hotchpotch system in which LEPs will be very effective in areas such as Greater Manchester and Merseyside but much less effective in areas such as Lancashire, because they may not reflect the genuine economic geography there. There is a big argument going on within Lancashire, as some noble Lords will know, about exactly which areas the LEPs will cover. If we are not careful, there is a real danger that we will end up with a two-tier system, which would be unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10112931000045"></a>The question is whether the regional development agency has been of any use to people on the ground in, for example, Pennine Lancashire, where I live. The answer is that, yes, it has. The regional development agency as an organisation has been able to hand out to local councils the capital moneys that the Government were making available and it has been able, to some extent, to co-ordinate private sector investment as well. That has been extremely valuable. At the moment, no such money-or very little new money-is coming from the Government for Pennine Lancashire. Schemes that we had, such as housing market renewal, have been closed down or are about to be closed down at the end of the financial year. What used to be called the council's capital allocations-more recently, they have been called the housing pots-are also being ended, so there is no real money for people to hand out at the moment.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10112931000046"></a>However, it is inconceivable that public sector regeneration and development moneys will not be made available by central government in future, so there needs to be a mechanism by which such moneys can be channelled to people in the region or sub-region who are capable of making sensible decisions about priorities within the region. That is where Amendment 8, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, comes in. The idea that people sitting in London could decide whether a scheme in Nelson, Burnley, Accrington or Blackburn should receive the limited amount of money that is available at any given time-or decide how that money should be divided between those or other places on the ground-is ludicrous. Civil servants in London are simply not capable of sensibly making those decisions. At the moment, officers of the regional development agency-both the elected officers, if I may call them that, and the permanent staff-travel around the region, visit places and find out for themselves by seeing things on the ground. We occasionally get visits from people from government departments in London. They set off on the train from Euston in the morning and come and spend three or four hours during the day before going back. For them, it is as if they had been visiting a foreign land, as it is a day out when they do not have to do any work. The idea that those people could maintain a

They could not do that. Given the number of local authorities in the country, they would require a huge number of staff anyway, which just will not be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10112931000047"></a>Some sort of regional organisation is necessary. If the new LEPs are to do that, so be it. However, we have to understand that. In my view, it would be disastrous if a lot of the functions that are currently performed at regional level-either in the regional offices or in the RDAs-are moved to London or elsewhere in England. That would be absolutely disastrous. If RDAs are to close down, the LEPs appear to be the only bodies that could fulfil their function. Amendment 12, which suggests that the transfer of functions must be to somewhere within the existing regions, is therefore crucial. These are fundamental issues that are not just a matter of efficient organisation of services and functions but a fundamental matter of whether decisions are made by people who are sufficiently local to have the understanding, contacts and networks to make sensible decisions. I support the amendment.</p>

I have been disappointed that so far in this debate we have heard nothing about the role of the local authorities. Nor have we heard from that region, which, from my perspective, is the Tees, the Wear and the Tyne; that is where the development has taken place. Middlesbrough is the largest importer of cars in the country-noble Lords might not think that is a fantastic thing to be done in that particular town, but there it is. I have worked in Stockton-on-Tees, in Hartlepool and up the coast of Durham when there were coal-mines, which the noble Baroness, Lady Armstrong, was reminding us about.

It is not clear on the face of it whether that is the case. I have little doubt that under Clause 1(3)(b) a "person exercising public functions" might, in view of the interpretation clause, include the transference of the RDA functions, which are conferred under an enactment-that enactment presumably being the subordinate legislation that the Bill provides for. However, it is not quite so clear that the last three sub-categories-companies limited by guarantee, a community interest company or a body of trustees-are appropriate for this.</p>

They do not know the employment potential or the real employment needs.</p>

With regard to the major cities, I remember going to Birmingham and being berated by both the Conservative and Labour leaders of Birmingham City Council about the uselessness of the West Midlands County Council.

We wish to see business opportunities in a broad range of sectors balanced across the country and between businesses. Our local growth White Paper, which was published in October, sets out how we will put businesses and local communities in charge of their own futures, rather than having to rely on centrally imposed RDAs. We are encouraging businesses, local authorities-noble Lords questioned where local authorities fitted into this pattern-and their partners to develop local enterprise partnerships, based on real economic areas such as Greater Manchester. My noble friend Lord Greaves mentioned the slight unease he sometimes had in the north-west at the dominance of the big conurbations of Manchester and Merseyside, for example.

Indeed at the beginning of June, after the election, he appointed the new chair and it was only two or three weeks later that he then decided, no, he was going to impose a different structure. What the Government are saying may be true for the rest of the country-it is for others to argue that-but it really is not true for the north-east. I am trying to get the Minister to understand that very different positions come from the north-east, and that somehow, if the Government are looking for bottom-up proposals, they are going to have to accept that and go back to the drawing-board on the north-east.</p>

This is quite deliberate because we have set out a number of key criteria. The partnerships need to have support from businesses and local authorities, they need to be based on real economic geography, and they need to offer real added value and ambition.

Despite this, they have not succeeded in their primary aim of narrowing the gap in economic performance between the three regions in the greater south-east and those in the rest of England. It is necessary to take a new approach if we are to achieve growth throughout the country. The <I>Local Growth</I> White Paper also announced a regional growth fund worth £1.4 billion over three years. Businesses and communities, including those working through local enterprise partnerships, will be able to bid for money from this fund. Its aim is to support projects and programmes that have the potential to stimulate growth and, in particular, to help those areas that are currently dependent on the public sector to achieve private sector-led growth.</p>

What, therefore, is the total reduction in the £1.4 billion? It must be very significant.</p>

That is a matter for discussions elsewhere. All I know is that the focus of the regional growth fund will be, as I just said, on those areas where communities have become particularly dependent on the public sector for employment and where private sector-led growth offers an opportunity for future development in those parts of the country. The fund will support the best proposals that come forward, wherever they come from and whether they come from private enterprise or the local enterprise partnerships. It will complement the other measures that the Government are taking to support growth through investment, education and skills, improvements in competition and research and innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10112933000004"></a>I turn now to the noble Lord's specific amendments. While Amendment 12 is designed to achieve the practical and sensible aim of allowing transfers of functions from bodies appearing in Schedule 1 to the Bill to local enterprise partnerships, we do not believe it is necessary. As I have said, in inviting businesses, local authorities and their partners to establish LEPs, Ministers chose to allow them the maximum level of flexibility. This extends to the type of partnership arrangements that they should put in place, which will be a matter for the partners themselves. Because of this, the Government do not intend to give local enterprise partnerships a statutory definition in the localism Bill or elsewhere. In other words, there will be no uniform model for local enterprise partnerships; they will be unique to the location in which they operate.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10112933000005"></a>With this in mind, the Bill is deliberately drafted to allow transfer of functions and assets to local enterprise partnerships, whatever legal form the partners choose to give them. Clause 1(3) defines an "eligible person" in a very wide way, including companies limited by guarantee and community interest companies. We expect many local enterprise partnerships will take these forms. In addition, in the case of transfers from the RDAs,  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1320"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Note 2 to Schedule 1 allows transfers to any body corporate. Therefore, the Bill as currently drafted already allows transfers to local economic partnerships in whatever form the partners choose to give them. There have been questions about what will happen to RDA assets. This was all set out in the <I>Local Growth</I> White Paper. RDA assets and liabilities will be disposed of or transferred in line with a clear set of shared principles, which include aiming for the best possible outcome for the region, consistent with achieving value for the public purse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10112933000006"></a>Amendments 8 and 16 have the potential seriously to hamper realisation of the vision set out in the Government's <I>Local Growth</I> White Paper. As I have said, we have asked local enterprise partnerships to respond to real economic geography. In some cases, for example the south Midlands-which noble Lords might well be aware of-Sheffield and Coast to Capital partnerships, they cross the old regional boundaries. We expect this trend to develop as more partnerships come forward or new partners become involved. These amendments would reimpose these artificial regional boundaries, which we sought to avoid. I gave an example from my personal experience of how difficult these artificial boundaries can sometimes be. In doing so, the amendments would remove the flexibility that lies at the heart of our policy.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10112933000007"></a>There are also examples of activities and assets that were developed with RDA money and are situated in particular regions, but which have national significance. For example, the wave hub in the south-west, by demonstrating the potential of new forms of power generation, brings benefits to the country as a whole. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will be mindful of that, given his previous role as Minister for Energy. Although no final decisions have been taken on transfer of particular functions, it is not likely to be practical for major national projects of this kind to be run and financed by any local enterprise partnership that happens to be nearby. There will be exceptions that are designed to protect the interests of these enterprises of national significance. Nor do we intend to maintain organisations at regional level just to run such enterprises. Our policy will remain flexible and we intend to take account of the evolving capabilities and priorities of different enterprise partnerships. However, it is unlikely that they will all be in a position to take on the full range of functions when RDAs are abolished.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10112933000008"></a>I will go through some notes. Yes, the local authority is an eligible person. I was asked that question expressly. In the north-east, the Secretary of State for Business said that he could see a case for a regional-level organisation of some kind but not for keeping the RDA as it was. I suggest that the noble Baroness has to marshal her arguments if she feels that there is a need for some regional co-ordination of the local enterprise partnerships in the north-east. I think I have covered more or less everything that was mentioned in debate. I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment and I look forward to debating these matters further. In response to a request, I will try to arrange for noble Lords to have a briefing that covers this policy, so that it will inform our later debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10112933000010"></a>The more important point is about the transfer of functions from the RDA. I hope that the Government will seriously think about this again. What I heard from the Minister was that there is an intention to centralise quite a lot of these functions. There is an intention that it will be top-down and that the growth fund will decide which projects will go ahead. When I have read Government policy statements, it seems to me that, on areas such as innovation, the marketing of the region and skills, it is intended that these functions will be conducted at national level.</p>

The council to which the amendment refers was only recently created by the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It is an advisory non-departmental public body sponsored by the Ministry of Justice. Its main functions are to keep the administrative justice system under review, indicate how the system might be made more accessible, more fair and more efficient and make any proposals needed for desirable change. It is a successor body to the Council on Tribunals set up in 1958 on the recommendation of the Franks committee. Sir Oliver Franks-later Lord Franks-was the chairman. It was called the Committee on Tribunals and Inquiries-an eminent body-to which I recall giving evidence, with others, from the Society of Labour Lawyers in 1957. The later Leggatt report of 2001, chaired by Lord Justice Leggatt, proposed not abolition-as this Government have-but to advocate a wider remit for the Council on Tribunals to focus particularly on the needs of users-or consumers, if you like-across the whole administrative justice landscape.</p>

<ul><a name="10112933000019"></a>"played a significant part in the development of administrative principles of good practice".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/11/10; col. 1023.]</ul>
<p><a name="10112933000017"></a>The noble and learned Lord went on to mention a number of areas, including welfare, fiscal disputes and many other kinds of disputes, which over the years have been dealt with by tribunals of all kinds. They have become famous for their work and have taken a greater and greater part of judicial work than ever before.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10112933000014"></a>Following our Second Reading debate on 9 November, in which I queried the inclusion of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council in Schedule 1, the Minister helpfully wrote to me a letter, dated 16 November, that was also placed in the House of Lords Library. In this letter the Minister agreed with me that the council and its predecessor body, the Council on Tribunals, had done a useful job, but went on to say that oversight of administrative justice policy was now a function of the Ministry of Justice. A body like this council-or the council as extended by the 2007 Act-should continue to exist only if it was "needed to provide impartial advice".</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10112933000015"></a>The purpose of bringing forth this amendment is to remove this council from the list of potential bodies to be abolished. My contention is that this body is still needed to provide impartial advice. The council and, for five decades, its predecessor, the Council on Tribunals, invariably consisted of judges, practitioners, academics and others from various backgrounds, acting, of course-because this is the only basis on which they would belong to such a council-on a part-time basis. The Government and the relevant department-the Lord Chancellor's Department, later the Ministry of Justice-had the benefit of a number of people with knowledge of the workings of tribunals, which could go to the work of the Council on Tribunals, be published in its specific reports and its regular annual reports. Although I express an interest as a former academic, the academics who were appointed to the Council on Tribunals often had knowledge of foreign systems of law that helped to feed into and inform the discussions of the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10112933000016"></a>Full-time civil servants within the Ministry of Justice have their value and place. They are important people. I certainly do not wish to denigrate them. However, full-time civil servants cannot replicate the breadth of knowledge and empirical experience that is so useful when an advisory body like this is called in to assist. I believe its abolition would be a serious loss. I beg to move.</p>

I did not want to take the lead on the amendment because that might have looked odd against that background, but I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has done so. For this purpose I regard him as my noble friend not least because, during the passage of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, it turned out that we had a remarkable number of things on which we saw eye to eye. I am very happy to support him.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10112941000002"></a>I was going to give-the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has done this for me, so I need not give it again-a sort of potted history of the origin of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, the Leggatt report, the part that the council has played in the creation of the proposed integrated courts and tribunals service and the contribution that I, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, feel that the council has made. However, the odd thing-which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, did not mention-is that the Franks report had its origin in something that happened in the mid-1950s, which one or two in the House may remember, in an incident called Crichel Down. The Crichel Down affair was thought to be a scandalous abuse of executive power that led to such great concerns that it was in effect the origin of the Council on Tribunals and of much that has happened in the intervening period. Indeed, that incident constitutes one of the few instances since the war in which there was a principled ministerial resignation following something that had happened in a minister's department. The Government may contend that there is no longer any risk of any kind of abuse of executive power in the dealings between citizen and state. The situation may be better than it was-I am glad that the Chief Whip is not present to hear this possibly tendentious remark-but I do not think that we would be discussing the Bill today if there was no risk of abuse of executive power. I do not believe that the need for safeguards has disappeared.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10112941000003"></a>We are discussing not an ephemeral body that was set up on a transient whim but a council that has been a consistent part of the scene-and generally valued as part of the scene-for some 50 years. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said, the council's powers were extended and its remit widened by Parliament only three years ago, with general support, as far as I can recall, and not a hint of opposition from any quarter in this House. However, now the council is included in Schedule 1 to the Bill. The remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, have already been referred to, so I will not repeat them, but I will seek to build on what has been said about the council's importance. The volumes of possible cases-not actual cases-between citizen and state include: 6 million benefit claimants; 2.5 million applications for visas; more than 25,000 applications for asylum; more than 220,000 pupils with statements of special educational needs; nearly 60,000 applications to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority; and nearly 25,000 complaints resolved by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. What we are talking about is administrative justice in all those areas-involving tribunals, ombudsmen and the like-between the citizen and the state. In

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10112941000004"></a>Let me give the House the success rates in the appeals over which the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council has had some kind of oversight function or watchdog-although I never used that word-role. Its success rates are as follows: for criminal injuries compensation, 43 per cent; for social security, 41 per cent; for immigration and asylum, nearly 40 per cent; for education admission appeals, more than 30 per cent; for education exclusion appeals, a quarter; and for the Care Standards Tribunal, 25 per cent. This is not an insignificant corner of the judicial system.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10112941000005"></a>The great schedule of quangos to be abolished was published on 14 October, but most of those were simply declared subsequently not to be quangos and disappeared-a marvellous piece of smoke and mirrors-although there are still about 500 left. In the original list, the Ministry of Justice included three justice councils-the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, the Family Justice Council and the Civil Justice Council-and four procedure rule committees. For some reason, one of those three councils has landed up in Schedule 1, whereas the other two are in Schedule 7. All four procedure rule committees-civil, criminal, family and tribunals-are in Schedule 7. All of those-the two other justice councils and the four procedure rule committees-are said to be retained because they perform a technical function that should be independent of government. The odd one out is the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, which operates in this crucial area of justice between citizen and state. The document just said, "Abolish-no longer needed". It did not say why; it just said that, to use a phrase that I used a week or so ago, the AJTC is for the chop.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10112941000006"></a>That decision is all the more difficult to understand when you compare the terms of reference of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council with those of the Civil Justice Council. I shall not read out those terms, as they have been rehearsed briefly by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, but you could hardly get a piece of tissue paper between them except for some odd bits of drafting. As the noble Lord has rehearsed, the terms of reference of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council require the council to look across the scene as a whole and at the needs of users. That seems to me, if anything, to be not less but more relevant in a world of staffing cutbacks, attempted cutbacks in legal aid and the desire to promote alternative dispute resolution as a more efficient way forward. Such objectives are supposed to be advanced by the council, which the Bill proposes to eliminate.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10112941000007"></a>I do not want to say too much more, but I will ask a number of questions. Whatever the reason for the proposal-we have not been given a serious reason-the one thing that it cannot be is the coalition's rhetoric about taking decisions back from bodies outside government, or at arm's length, into government itself. I ask the Minister a rhetorical question: at the end of the debate, will he give me a list of the decisions that the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council takes, or could take, that should be taken by the Government?  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1325"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This is not going to trouble him very much. If he likes, I will give him a blank sheet of paper now, and he can give me a blank sheet of paper back as the answer because there are no such decisions.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10112941000008"></a>I will also pose some questions that are not at all rhetorical. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, indicated that the Minister had said that there was some kind of oversight role of the administrative justice system in the Ministry of Justice. Unless things have changed much more dramatically in the past year or so than I have caught up with, there is no serious centre of responsibility for administrative justice in the Government. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the Tribunals Service. This may have changed in the past year, but I think that I am right in saying that the Cabinet Office is responsible for ombudsman policy. However, individual departments often go down their own curious track in respect of ombudsmen. That was illustrated during the passage of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, when the Department for Transport or the Department of Energy-I forget which-argued for competing ombudsmen. The competition was between suppliers of services choosing which ombudsmen they wanted rather than consumers choosing which ombudsmen they wanted-a daft policy, if ever there was one. Therefore, ombudsmen do not seem to be controlled within a principled framework. If I am right in saying that the Cabinet Office is responsible for this matter, the Ministry of Justice is obviously not responsible.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10112941000009"></a>The responsibility for education admissions and exclusion appeals lies essentially with education departments and local authorities. Policy on parking fines is in the hands of the Department for Transport. Each department is responsible for its own standards of complaints handling, review and all the rest of it. This is diffused across government. In reality, that has to be the case, especially for complaints handling and reviews. It seems to me that a body that can look from outside the immediate confines of government across the field is at least as much needed in this area as in any other.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10112941000010"></a>Let me ask a further few questions before I conclude what I had not intended to be so long a speech. Is it the Government's view that there is no longer a need for this body, or anything like it? If so, why? If not, how will the role and purpose be performed in future, and by whom? Bearing in mind that the structure of the AJTC included a Scottish committee and a newly created Welsh committee, I want to ask whether the devolved Administrations were consulted before the AJTC appeared in Schedule 1. If so, did they agree? What will happen if Scotland or Wales, or both. wishes to maintain the AJTC committees that they currently have?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10112941000011"></a>There are dozens more questions to be asked, but I will not go on any further. I am not expecting immediate answers from the Minister, and I certainly do not want answers hastily concocted by his excellent officials on the basis of briefing provided by departments to which they do not belong. I am not saying that there is no case for any kind of change or movement. There could well be some scope for rationalisation. Rather curiously, since I do not much like Schedule 7, I would be far  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1326"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happier if the AJTC was in Schedule 7 rather than in Schedule 1, so that at least the Government would have some time to give proper thought to it and come forward with some serious proposals. If the Minister says that all these questions will be answered when an order is made under Schedule 1, I have to say to him that, in my view, we should have both the rationale and the answers to these questions before-not after-his colleagues are given powers to abolish such a body by not much more than the stroke of an administrative pen. I look forward to his comments on these and other points.</p>

I thought it might be of interest to the Committee to look again at what Sir Andrew Leggatt said in 2001 about the old Council on Tribunals, since it was on his report that the 2007 Act was based. It does not seem to have occurred to Sir Andrew Leggatt that the council would cease to be of any utility once the new system had come into operation-quite the contrary. Briefly, he said in his overview:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10112941000104"></a>"The Council-</p>

<p><a name="10112941000090"></a>that is, this council-</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000111"></a>"should act as the hub of the wheel that is the Tribunals System. Its functions should include taking evidence from user groups, from the Tribunals Service, from the departments, and from the Judicial Studies Board about how well the system is working. This oversight"-</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000091"></a>note the word "oversight"-</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000112"></a>"should be in addition to, not instead of, the direct relationship that will exist between the participants in the tribunal process".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000092"></a>A little later he says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10112941000105"></a>"Departments"-</p>

<p><a name="10112941000093"></a>that now would include the Ministry of Justice-</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000113"></a>"should be under a duty to consult the Council on primary (in addition to secondary) legislation, and it should be given specific ... authority to comment on it".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000094"></a>Those were Sir Andrew's views, and they were, of course, adopted by Parliament in the 2007 Act. Section 44 sets up the new council, and it is included under the following chapter heading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="10112941000106"></a>"Oversight"-</p>

<p><a name="10112941000095"></a>again, note the word-</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000114"></a>"of Administrative Justice System, Tribunals and Inquiries".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000096"></a>In the schedule, its functions are described as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="10112941000107"></a>"The Council is to ... keep the administrative justice system under review".</p>

<p><a name="10112941000097"></a>The schedule goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000115"></a>"'the administrative justice system' means the overall system by which decisions of an administrative or executive nature are made in relation to particular persons".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000098"></a>It really could not be clearer than that.</p>
<a name="time_23"></a>
<a name="101129-0002.htm_time5"></a><h5><a name="10112941000120"></a>7.15 pm<I></I></h5>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10112941000013"></a>As the Committee will know, under the new regime the council's remit is far wider than it was under the old system. The administrative court, again as the   


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1327"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee will know, is the heart of the modern civil justice system. It is there that the crucial decisions are made that affect the rights of individual citizens. The reason is, of course, that it is in the administrative court that the individual citizen can challenge Ministers' decisions by way of judicial review.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10112941000014"></a>The court, as I know, is concerned day in and day out with ministerial powers-for example, under the Terrorism Act, in immigration cases, or in the score of other ways in which ministerial decisions affect individuals. It follows that, of all the bodies named in Schedule 1, the council is the one that is most directly involved in,</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000116"></a>"establishing facts in relation to, or oversight or scrutiny of, Ministers' actions".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000099"></a>Those words appear in paragraph (b) of Amendment 108, which the Minister put before the Committee.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10112941000015"></a>To give an example, we all remember the time, some years ago now, when Ministers attempted to exclude judicial review from immigration cases. The attempt did not succeed. Next time it will not be so obvious, but the danger is still there. Immigration is surely an area which the council should continue to keep under review as part of the overall administrative justice system. It is surely an area in which it can still offer impartial advice to the Government.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10112941000016"></a>It is no good saying that the work of the council can be done just as well by civil servants in the Ministry of Justice; it cannot. Of course civil servants are impartial; no one questions that. Nevertheless, they lack the "professional or specialist expertise"- again, I quote the Minister's own amendment-that the council can offer. This council happens to fall within both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of the Minister's own amendment, which should in itself be enough to take this council right outside Schedule 1. The trouble is that that is not enough under the Bill. The Minister has only to consider paragraphs (a) and (b) of his own amendment, which no doubt he would do anyway, so that the great safeguard that is said to be offered by the amendment is, in my submission, very largely illusory.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10112941000017"></a>It may be said that all these matters can be put right at the end of the day when the draft order is laid before the House. Amendment 118 is no better than Amendment 108. The Minister need only "have regard" to recommendations made at that stage. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, made it very clear last week that he was totally opposed to anything in the nature of a veto being imposed at that stage. So what can we do? Our only chance, as I understand it-and as I think the Minister confirmed-is to remove the council from Schedule 1 by voting to do so now.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10112941000018"></a>That brings me to my last point. It will take a long time to go through all the bodies in Schedule 1, let alone those in Schedules 2 to 7, if we take them one by one on the Floor of the House in Committee. Is there not, even now, something to be said, before we get completely bogged down in the process, for deferring the rest of Committee and committing the Bill to a Select Committee, as we can do and as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, proposed at the end of Second Reading? This seemed an extremely sensible suggestion. It worked in the case of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, as everyone accepts, and it would work  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1328"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>again here. This is just the sort of Bill for which the detailed consideration that is possible in a Select Committee is most appropriate.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10112941000019"></a>Once we are in Select Committee-I know how it works from past experience-one is amazed by how quickly things go. The Minister would soon see that certain bodies in Schedule 1 clearly must be excluded. The rest of us would equally soon see that certain bodies in the schedule clearly ought to be abolished. The whole thing would be much simpler and quicker. It would take perhaps three or four months at most, as it did last time, but in the end a great deal of time would be saved because we would not have to go through each of these bodies and take a vote, which is the only course open to us now. I very much hope that the noble Lord, who has been so reasonable throughout, will consider again the possibility of opting for a Select Committee. I know that there was a vote against this, but it would still be possible-and, I suggest, very desirable-to reverse that vote.</p>

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="10112941000020"></a><b><a name="101129-0002.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="10112941000436"></a>Lord Howe of Aberavon:</b> My Lords, I am the final person who has their name down in support of the amendment, and I support all the points made so far by noble Lords on all sides of the House. I confess that when my noble friend the Minister first presented this set of propositions upstairs to a collection of us from all sides of the House, I was reckless enough to describe the prospect as a potential tsunami of constitutional vandalism. That phrase struck me because of the structure of the Bill, which has since been criticised by the Constitution Committee. However, the more I have heard about the way in which my noble friend has been handling the Bill and responding to debate in this House, the more I am convinced that that is certainly nowhere near his intention, nor near the intention of the Government.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10112941000021"></a>The Government may have been misled in the definition of their objective by the rationale set out by the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude. He said that the Government should not leave this to people or bodies that were unelected and allowed to remain when their mission had long been accomplished. This is the approach: to see what may have outlived its usefulness. A Cabinet Office press release of 14 October this year states that,</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000117"></a>"the Government's presumption is that state activity, if needed at all, should be undertaken by bodies that are democratically accountable at either national or local level".</ul>
<a name="101129-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10112941000022"></a>No one could quarrel with that. However, the power is often exercised by Ministers and civil servants-no doubt most of the time in good faith-and it ignores the necessity of having an independent, external review. That is why the structure of this law-recounted in full by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, rests on history. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, recollected the Society of Labour Lawyers in the 1950s, and I recollect similar activity in what was then the Inns of Court Conservative and Unionist Society. We pressed for change under the leadership of people such as Lord Gardiner and Lord Simon of Glaisdale, seeking to promote the case that was scrutinised by Lord Franks and that led us, as has already been recounted, to the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958. The remarkable thing is that that has been the foundation for further review and reform. Noble  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1329"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lords have already gone through that and brought us up to date with the Inquiries Act 2005 and the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10112941000023"></a>Perhaps I may add an anecdote of my own. It was my good fortune, while practising the profession that I have long since forgotten but of which I am still proud, that after representing Coal Board officials at the Aberfan inquiry, I was appointed to conduct an inquiry into misbehaviour at Ely Hospital, Cardiff. It was an ad hoc inquiry of the kind that has been repeated in many cases since. It was also an illustration of the way in which administration can go wrong. Throughout the operation of the inquiry, we struggled to secure our independence. In the first instance, we were not allowed to announce our existence, but we pressed for that to happen in order to appeal for outside witnesses. We were told that we could not have sufficient legal representation within the organisation. When we submitted our first report, we were told that we were going beyond our requirements by exceeding the mere description of facts and by daring to venture recommendations, and so on. My colleagues and I wrote two reports, one of which included the recommendations and one that did not. Happily, we were able to make sure that the then Secretary of State, Richard Crossman, who had a special adviser who had been a colleague of mine at Cambridge, knew of the existence of the two drafts and immediately authorised publication of the full draft. This decision was acclaimed later in a biography by Anthony Howard as one of his most courageous acts.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10112941000024"></a>The point of the anecdote is to illustrate the extent to which conduct within a democratically elected institute can be less than perfect. That is why we have the structures that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, went through so carefully-the outside tribunals and bodies to which appeals can be taken. The Tribunals and Inquiries Act was replaced to some degree by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007-after the preceding body had been in existence for 50 years. Its position was enhanced and its structure detailed in Schedule 7 of the Act, which covered some 11 pages. Therefore, we have a body that has been well established for a specific purpose: to oversee areas that might otherwise be left entirely to elected bodies and people appearing before them. It would be wholly indefensible to remove this body from the existing structure of our balance between administration, law and politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10112941000025"></a>Indeed, I am worried on a broader basis, not just on this issue, by the extent to which the bodies and agencies listed in Schedule 1 have had their self-confidence eroded by the prospect of dismissal or disappearance. This cannot be a good state of affairs. I dare say that a number of other noble Lords have received a letter in the past few days from the National Council for Independent Monitoring Boards, meaning the national council for prison councils, drawing attention to the fact that those bodies, which are now uncertain about their continued existence, engage the activity of 1,800 members who work without remuneration, represent the public and conduct the kind of function that tends to be conducted by independent organisations outside the administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10112941000026"></a>The sad thing is that a frisson of anxiety is going through society, which the Prime Minister rightly wants to amplify as "great society". Somehow, we are creating a pattern of anxiety among the very great society that has played such a useful part and that will continue to do so. The point has been made by all who have spoken on this amendment on this particular body. It certainly deserves serious consideration by the Minister.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10112941000027"></a>I follow the last, and important, point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. Is this really going to be the way forward-examining each one of the agencies listed in the schedule? Is there not something fundamentally awkward about handing all these things over to the Administration in one form or another? It is even more ironic that the Prime Minister should be considering the possibility of an opinion poll of happiness in society when this Bill is creating such a widespread degree of unhappiness in the agencies affected by this proposition. It is also unfortunate that the final decisions that are to be taken are not capable of being scrutinised to the extent that we should wish by this Parliament, including the democratically elected body, for the reasons criticised by the Constitution Committee of this House. It would be ironic if this Parliament's appraisal of this legislation was itself inhibited when the legislation was capable of undoing virtuous institutions built up very thoughtfully over half a century or more.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10112941000028"></a>I hope my noble friend the Minister will understand our proposition, not just for the removal of this institution from the schedule but for much more fundamental scrutiny of the way in which these still rather alarming propositions are being presented to the country.</p>

There is a further reason why it is so essential that we retain an independent and impartial body to review the performance of tribunals; so many of the decisions of these tribunals concern the implementation of government policy, and it is government departments that are the defendants in those tribunal proceedings.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10112941000030"></a>It is undoubtedly a fact today that a far greater proportion of legal rights are vindicated in tribunals than in 1958 when the Council on Tribunals was established. It will be the inevitable consequence of the reductions in legal aid that those trends are exacerbated. It is therefore even more important today than it was in 1958 that there be an independent and impartial body that supervises and assesses the performance of these judicial functions.</p>

What has been said by my noble friend Lord Borrie, what has been said so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, and by the noble and learned Lords, Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Howe of Aberavon, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, is not only correct but I hope the Minister will take comfort from the fact that he could not have been shot at by more accurate huntsmen.

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10112941000032"></a>I have pleasure in rising because I am pleased to add my voice to those others. There is also, however, concern and a little sadness that I am driven to speak at all, prompted by the Government's as yet unsubstantiated case for abolishing the council. It is sad to see the council head the list for abolition under Schedule 1.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10112941000033"></a>This House will remember the debate in 2007. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and others are right to say there was unanimity in this House about the necessity to keep the council, the sagacity of Sir Andrew Leggatt's report and the rightness of supporting it. The Minister may recall that the late and much missed Lord Kingsland said in relation to the then Government's proposal that they had got it absolutely right by following Sir Andrew's arguments. He was talking about constitutionality. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, was therefore right to quote what was said by Sir Andrew Leggatt and to endorse it.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10112941000034"></a>I was also concerned, when looking at the Chairman's foreword for the most recent annual report of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, to read:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="10112941000108"></a>"However, as the text of this foreword was being finalised we learned that the AJTC is to be included among the MoJ sponsored Arms Length Bodies to be abolished through the Public Bodies Reform Bill, due to be introduced in Parliament in the autumn. Whilst recognising the absolute prerogative of Ministers and Parliament to take such a decision, the outcome is disappointing and it is unfortunate that we were not included in the discussions leading to this decision. However we look forward to contributing to the debate".</p>

<p><a name="10112941000100"></a>The foreword points to the fact that this council in its various forms has done sterling work on behalf of individuals for the past 50 years and has throughout been applauded for its achievements. My concern is aggravated therefore by the quality of the process undertaken by the Government in making this choice. The annual report sets out all the reasons why the council should be retained. There are many around this House who feel that the inclusion of the council on the Schedule 1 list is extraordinary.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10112941000035"></a>That feeling of unhappiness is exacerbated when one considers the millions of people who may be affected by the acts and omissions undertaken by various administrative bodies which have their roles scrutinised by tribunals with the council supporting them.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10112941000036"></a>I, too, agree with the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and echoed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, that if we are to go through the list organisation by organisation, entity by entity, it will take some considerable time if each body is to be given the scrutiny it deserves.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10112941000037"></a>Your Lordships will know that if the council is to remain on the list, a great deal of unhappiness-not just in this House but for individuals who are adversely affected by that decision-will be occasioned. I should conclude with a view comments from Sir Andrew Leggatt himself, when talking about the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council. He said:</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1332"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="10112941000109"></a>"There should be one guiding principle. In origin, many tribunal functions started within the administrative process. Tribunals were established because it was clear that the citizen needed an independent means of challenging possible mistakes and illegalities which was faster, simpler and cheaper than recourse to the courts. Tribunals are an alternative to court, not administrative, processes. They will keep the confidence of users only in so far as they are seen to demonstrate similar qualities of independence and impartiality to the courts".</p>

<p><a name="10112941000101"></a>His words go to the heart of why judicial and quasi-judicial bodies need additional protection, and is why I and many others support the amendment. Independence has to be established and has to be seen, felt, and tasted. If the council is removed, I add a question to those posed by the noble Lord, Lord Newton: how is that to be guaranteed if everything is invested in the department, which may be in need of challenge, assistance and advice?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10112941000038"></a>I urge the Minister to say this evening that the council's name will be struck from the schedule. Then the House would not be put through the burden to vote and the noble Lord may have greater time to consider the other bodies which may or may not merit inclusion.</p>

<p><a name="st_179"></a>

As all noble Lords have said, this is the first body to be debated-not because it is the most important but because of the way in which we have ordered our alphabet. I might have chosen a different one to start with, I might add, but I think that the whole House will understand that. I am grateful for the widespread and learned comments from various noble Lords around the House, including my noble friend Lord Newton and my noble and learned friend Lord Howe, whose experience I respect.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10112941000040"></a>Perhaps I can put this decision into context and explain to the House the Government's thinking. I should start by saying that this body is not itself a tribunal. It is a council which has a role in advising on how tribunals might best function, but it is not a tribunal. That the amendment would remove the Administrative Justice and Tribunal's Council from the schedule is in many ways a tribute to the development of the Tribunal Service under the previous Government. As noble Lords will know, there has been a considerable expansion of the Tribunal Service, and it is to that Tribunal Service that the public has access. I quite agree that tribunals are a much better way of resolving matters of injustice in the vast majority of cases involving individual citizens.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10112941000041"></a>The Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council is an advisory body. It was set up under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007-as several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, mentioned-to advise the Lord Chancellor, the Ministers of the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales and the Senior President of Tribunals on administrative justice. That is its role. To be clear, the AJTC is not a judicial body. Its abolition would not have a direct impact on judicial independence or judicial decision-making.</p>

I make no apologies; there is logic behind that. The tribunal system in the devolved authorities has not undergone the same development as has been undergone in England. The specific development in England occurred during the previous Government, and that situation could continue, although I think that it is unlikely.</p>

We are talking to the devolved authorities about this whole business. Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already passed its own public bodies review, which has been running for two years now, so it is not a strange thing for people involved in Scottish politics to come to terms with a Bill such as this.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10112941000049"></a>To return to my remarks, one of the council's functions is to keep under review the constitution and working of tribunals. That function dates back to the AJTC's predecessor body, the Council of Tribunals which, as noble Lords have said, was established by the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958. That Act was the result of Sir Oliver Franks's report on administrative tribunals and inquiries, which was published in 1957. The tribunals landscape has changed immensely since the late 1950s, and much of that change has been relatively recent. I hope that I have paid adequate tribute to the previous Government's work in that regard. Sir Andrew Leggatt's 2001 review, <I>Tribunals for Users</I>, calls for a more unified tribunal structure supported by an independent Tribunal Service. April 2006 saw the beginning of that. The Tribunal Service was  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1334"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set up to administer the tribunals within the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Then came the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act, which received Royal Assent in 2007. The main effects of this legislation included the creation of a new, simplified, statutory framework for tribunals to provide coherence and enable future reform and the unification of the tribunals' judiciary under the Senior President of Tribunals.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10112941000050"></a>It was envisaged that the AJTC, set up under the 2007 Act, would advise on the development of the Tribunals Service and be able to offer proposals for change. This the AJTC did, first under the very capable leadership of my noble friend Lord Newton and more recently under the chairmanship of Richard Thomas. It has played an important role in helping in the creation of the Tribunals Service and deserves proper recognition for this.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10112941000051"></a>However, we have now moved from a structure in which tribunals were funded by the departments whose decisions they reviewed, which left appellants feeling they were always at an away match. We now have a unified Tribunals Service which is well established, supporting the majority of central government tribunals, and run by the Ministry of Justice. So I believe that the AJTC has served its purpose in helping to set up the unified service.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10112941000052"></a>The review of public bodies that the Government have undertaken has resulted in agreement that remaining central government tribunals outside the Tribunals Service will either transfer in or will be considered for transfer in. In addition, the development of tribunals policy-</p>

There was no suggestion that the council was to come to an end when the Tribunals Service took effect-not in the slightest.</p>

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="10112941000054"></a><b><a name="101129-0002.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="10112941000447"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> At that time that was certainly the case. I accept that. The 2007 Act did not do away with the council. The noble and learned Lord, with a slip of the tongue, said "tribunal". It is not a tribunal; it is an advisory council. It is very important that noble Lords bear that in mind.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10112941000055"></a>In addition, the development of tribunal policy and the development of governance arrangements for the Tribunals Service mean the AJTC's review function is no longer needed. I concur with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that the input of the judiciary and academics is crucial to the improvement of services and policy development. I do not envisage that their involvement will cease with the abolition of the council. Officials will continue to seek their views as part of policy development in relation to tribunals and administrative justice reform.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10112941000056"></a>The AJTC also has a role in keeping statutory inquiries under review. For any noble Lords present who are not familiar with the AJTC's work, I should perhaps explain that this role does not include keeping under review public inquiries such as Dunblane or Shipman. The AJTC has focused mainly on inquiries relating to land use.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1335"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10112941000057"></a>The Planning Inspectorate, which is an executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government, is responsible for the determination of planning and enforcement appeals and routinely holds statutory inquiries into a range of land use developments. The Planning Inspectorate has now established a robust quality assurance unit, operating across all functions of the inspectorate to ensure appropriate standards and procedures are upheld. The quality assurance unit can, if necessary, recommend changes in the inspectorate's audit committee or the inspectorate's main board. The inclusion of non-executive directors on the inspectorate's board ensures external scrutiny. Therefore, the AJTC's review function in relation to statutory inquiries is no longer required.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10112941000058"></a>Of course, the AJTC was given broader statutory functions under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 than its predecessor body, the Council on Tribunals. These are to keep the administrative justice system under review; to consider ways to make the system accessible, fair and efficient; to advise on the development of the administrative justice system; and to put forward proposals for change and make proposals for research.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10112941000059"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Newton, suggests that one of the functions of the AJTC was to act as a curb on executive power, I have to say that this was not a function of the AJTC and perhaps I can clarify that by going back to the 2004 White Paper <I>Transforming Public Services: Complaints, Redress and Tribunals</I><I>.</I> It proposed a widened remit for an Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council but it also envisaged that the then Department for Constitutional Affairs would,</p>
<ul><a name="10112941000118"></a>"take the lead on co-ordinating redress policy across Government. Its task will be to facilitate development of more integrated and consistent dispute resolution systems for the benefit of the public. It will take a systemic view across the various means of tackling disputes and the roles of the different organisations that provide them (courts, tribunals, ombudsmen, independent complaints handlers, etc). It will propose ways of dealing with gaps, weaknesses and overlaps while drawing on the unique qualities and key strengths of the distinct elements of the current arrangements".</ul>
<p><a name="10112941000102"></a>That was the last Government's proposal under the 2004 White Paper for the role of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In recent times, priority has been given to reforms to the tribunals system but, as the Ministry of Justice has taken on what is properly its responsibility and a wider administrative justice capability is being developed, it will take the lead-</p>

I have listened very carefully to this. He has made much of the fact that the Ministry of Justice will take on a series of roles and functions that noble Lords seem to be mistaken in thinking that the advisory council would be performing. Can he give us some idea of how many people in the new, streamlined Ministry of Justice will be available to actually give this kind of support to the tribunals?</p>

The noble Lord correctly referred to the advisory council. We are talking about executive responsibility envisaged by the previous Government, vested in the Department for Constitutional Affairs and currently recognised by this Government as being vested in the  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1336"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ministry of Justice. As I was saying, it will take the lead on the co-ordination redress of policy across government, facilitating development of more integrated and consistent dispute resolution systems. It will also take a systemic view across the various means of tackling disputes and the roles of the different organisations that provide them. By enhancing the policy function, the Ministry of Justice will be well placed to look across the entire administrative justice system.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10112941000062"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newton, is absolutely correct: the Cabinet Office is responsible for ombudsmen policy, including the Parliamentary Ombudsman. Each department is responsible for ombudsmen within each policy area on which it leads. However, administrative justice includes both tribunals and redress by ombudsmen and therefore the Ministry of Justice will take a systemic view across government, including ombudsman functions, as part of its role leading on administrative justice policy. For example, the Ministry of Justice recognises that administrative justice is an end-to-end process and that getting it right at the start of this process-that is, good-quality original decisions by the public bodies concerned-is vital. Getting it right first time benefits everyone concerned.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10112941000063"></a>Of course, the departments and public bodies making the original decision have the primary responsibility to ensure high-quality decision-making. That said, the Tribunals Service has been actively working with the larger decision-making agencies whose appeals it deals with-for example, the Department for Work and Pensions and the UK Border Agency, and my noble friend Lord Newton referred to the very large number of cases that that can involve-to review end-to-end dispute resolution procedures and feedback arrangements. The Tribunals Service will continue to work with decision-makers to improve getting it right first time and will seek to spread lessons learnt among relevant decision-making bodies to drive up standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10112941000064"></a>Going back to the AJTC's functions concerned with keeping administrative justice under review, it is clear that advising on the development of the administrative justice system, putting forward proposals for change and making proposals for research are the proper functions of the ministry. But I recognise that noble Lords take the view that an independent body will take a different approach to a government department on what "keeping under review" means, especially if that body has said, as the AJTC says in its strategic plan, that its work is driven by the needs of users.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10112941000065"></a>It behoves all public bodies involved in the administrative justice system to always keep the needs of the user at the heart of their system and service provision. However, the Ministry of Justice will continue to seek the views of users on the services it provides. The Tribunals Service already has a range of user groups at national and local levels, which bring together representatives of the public who use tribunal services, professional groups such as the Bar and the Law Society, and the judiciary and Administration to consider the operation of tribunal services.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10112941000066"></a>With regard to the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council's functions which relate to the oversight and development of administrative justice, I believe that  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1337"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this is properly a core function of the Ministry of Justice and should not be duplicated elsewhere. The Government's arm's-length body review concluded that the Civil Justice Council performed a technical function and should be retained. I should remind the noble Lord that there is a substantive difference between the functions of the AJTC and the Civil Justice Council. Most significantly, the Civil Justice Council advises the Lord Chancellor on the development of the civil justice system and refers proposals to change to the Lord Chancellor and the civil procedure committee.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10112941000067"></a>Finally, the AJTC and the Council on Tribunals have made a valuable contribution. It is not the Government's intention that the work done so far should be wasted. I understand that there are continuing discussions between the present AJTC chairman and Ministry of Justice officials to identify the priority work to take forward. There is a changed landscape in the world of tribunals, which is largely a heritage of the previous Government. In the light of these explanations, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

First, he referred to users. When I was chair, the Tribunals Service asked me, on behalf of the council, to chair the users' groups for mental health and for war pensions on the grounds that the council could do it better than them. I should like to know whether the Government know the view of the senior president of tribunals on this proposal. How will the position of a body such as the Down's Syndrome Association, which has recently written to me-I have its letter here, but I will not read it, in which it raises concerns about the reduction in legal aid, to which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, referred-be represented by the Ministry of Justice? It is complaining about the effect on tribunals, and the proposals on legal aid have come from another part of the same department under the same Secretary of State. How can that be the case?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10112941000069"></a>There are a lot of other questions. I could say a lot more, but I am deeply depressed by the fact that my noble friend has not felt able to go further in terms of being willing to look at this. The Government should look at this again and should recognise the strength of feeling that is by no means confined to the opposition Benches, as is very clear. I hope that, even now, he will say that further consideration will be given to this, so that those of us who would like to reach a rational, considered, thought-through conclusion can at least have some chance of hope that that might happen.</p>

It is normal for someone in my position, who is summing up and is to determine whether there should be a vote or not, to give some mention of his supporters. I have been most fortunate because support has come from the experienced noble Lord, Lord Newton, a former chairman of the council, from the noble and learned Lords, Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Howe of Aberavon, my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland, and from the noble Lord, Lord Pannick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10112941000072"></a>The second thing that someone in my position normally does is say what a good debate we have had. But we have not had a good debate because the only propositions on the other side were from the Minister, who I am bound to say, on the same lines as the noble Lord, Lord Newton, was a great disappointment. He stuck closely to the brief, which clearly had been prepared long before this debate began. There is nothing necessarily wrong in doing that in part; but, surely, after all the points that have been made in favour of this amendment from all sides of the House, there could have been some give, some notion-that instead of just saying, "This body has outlived its usefulness; all its work can now be done by civil servants in the Ministry of Justice", something positive could be given. Nothing was given. My view is that we should go to a vote on this amendment and I appeal to noble Lords from all sides of the House to support the view that this body should be removed from the list of bodies to be abolished in Schedule 1.</p>

<a name="10112941000073"></a><b><a name="101129-0002.htm_spnew54"></a><a name="10112941000454"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My Lords, I declare my interest as a clinician and as a former vice-dean of a medical school. Clinical academics are at the heart  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1341"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of academic health partnerships. Traditionally, clinical academics have mostly been doctors and are the clinical academic leaders of today. But other health professions are joining this group who are employed by universities to research and teach, as well as having direct patient responsibilities. Medical schools are at the heart of this unique position that juxtaposes research abilities within the clinical context, stimulating questions that need answering and permitting studies to be planted in reality.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10112941000074"></a>The UK has a fantastic record in biomedical research. Some 10 per cent of all the academic output in the world is from the UK, but we have less than 1 per cent of the world population. Twelve per cent of listed medical research citations are from the UK, second only to the US, and 19 of the 75 most widely prescribed drugs were discovered here. Investment in biomedical research made over the past 20 years is reaping dividends. The challenge is to get the findings translated into routine practice. Research assessment exercises have tended to steer towards basic science as it is easier for the RAE than applied research. Simultaneously, NHS management has been driven by targets. It is the UK medical schools that sit in the middle of this financial tension. Although tension can be creative, there is a danger that knee-jerk financial responses can undermine long-term, potentially very profitable investment if academic and clinical medicine are forced apart by short-term commissioning decisions.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10112941000075"></a>Countering this pressure has been the National Institute for Health Research, in large part inspired by Dame Sally Davies. Its impact has been phenomenal. Schemes it has supported are being copied and rolled out in the devolved Administrations. Clinical academic training fellowships are attracting increasing numbers of the brightest young doctors as state-of-the-art activities are introduced into trusts, adherence to guidelines improves and evidence-based best practice spreads. The five major health sciences centres in England, Imperial College, King's College, University College London, Manchester and Cambridge, are direct products of this initiative. They build on the juxtaposition of research and direct clinical care, with major laboratory research linked to clinical practice. But there is also a major benefit to UK plc from all the other academic centres. So I ask the Minister for reassurance that the Department of Health is working closely with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to maintain our profitability from clinical academia.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10112941000076"></a>There is good evidence that clinical outcomes are better from all routine clinical services that are research and teaching active. Indeed, that was recognised in the White Paper. Medical schools responsible for the undergraduate teaching of tomorrow's doctors are all active in research and they have clearly demonstrated that investment pays dividends. For example, every pound of public money invested in cardiovascular research has, after 15 to 20 years, generated a benefit of 39 pence annually in perpetuity. Recent translation of research into practice is illustrated by the reconfiguration of stroke management in London, with better clinical outcomes now that many stroke units have been rationalised down to centres managing hyper-acute stroke providing rapid thrombolysis, decreasing morbidity and long-term care needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10112941000077"></a>We take for granted the many previously unimaginable surgical procedures and drug treatments that are now an everyday occurrence. When people are seriously ill they want a specialist to guide their management; someone who is research-active in the area of their disease. I ask the Minister how the importance of academic medicine will be recognised by the GP consortia, many of which will be led by GPs who are not involved in research. How will public health research be supported and financed as public health moves to local authority control?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10112941000078"></a>The health and wealth agenda is served by maintaining the momentum in clinical academia, yet we are already seeing an adverse drift. The pharmaceutical industry is drifting off to other countries with consequent revenue and job loss to the UK. In 2002, 6 per cent of the clinical trials in the world were conducted here but by 2007 this had fallen to 2 per cent.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10112941000079"></a>The recent NHS White Paper speaks strongly of the benefits of research with 10 distinct references to it. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="10112941000110"></a>"The Government is committed to the promotion and conduct of research as a core NHS role".</p>

<p><a name="10112941000103"></a>It goes on to recognise that, particularly in lean financial times, research can provide routes to improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities. Following the consultation on the White Paper, can the Minister reassure us that the commitment to those centres that develop research and unlock synergies between research, education and patient care, remains stronger than ever?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10112941000080"></a>Medical schools have been working with their NHS university hospital partners to plan for the future. They recognise that health and higher education have flourished with political support over recent years and that the global recession's impact on the UK's economy will change this growth trajectory. Future success and sustainability require that the core businesses of teaching, research and healthcare delivery are aligned to weather the changes in the financial climate. Collaborative working, not competitive vying for resources, will be the way forward.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10112941000081"></a>Within the NHS the governance system should be based on proportionality of risk rather than "one size fits all". Clinical research ethics committee processes have speeded up but bureaucratic blocks to research still exist so that opportunities cannot be grasped even though economic recovery will depend on them. Inspection processes, such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency inspections, can seem excessively laborious. I ask the Minister: what levers are there in the new NHS to address such blocks to innovation and research?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10112941000082"></a>The new GMC document, <I>Tomorrow's Doctors</I>, requires the doctors of the future to focus on leadership and a lifetime commitment to improvement in recognition of the importance that such a skilled workforce will bring to the wealth of the nation. Training does not end with a medical degree. Postgraduate training takes years and currently it is the responsibility of postgraduate deans, but where will the postgraduate deans sit? They are not mentioned in the White Paper.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10112941000083"></a>Clinical academics emerged during the postgraduate years. The Wellcome Trust postgraduate fellowships   


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1343"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aim to recognise and grow the UK's future medical academics. As specialty and primary care trainees develop an understanding of applied research when working clinically, and as strategic health authorities disappear, it makes sense for universities to be persuaded to house the postgraduate deans, who will not usually be RAE returnable and so will need to have some honorary contract arrangement. However, these deans need a ring-fenced budget to have a lever on foundation trusts to employ this workforce and ensure high-quality training.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10112941000084"></a>Vice-chancellors, too, need to understand the benefits brought from effective partnerships with the NHS and from engaging with the postgraduate training agenda. Structures and performance that match the NHS agenda require incentivisation: for example, by adding locally relevant work with industry to the criteria rewarded by panels assessing the impact of research for the funding councils.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10112941000085"></a>Academic health partnerships can bring solutions to pressing public health issues, both here in the UK and globally. They represent an investment in our foreign policy. They can bring solutions to the requirements of an ageing population susceptible to multiple chronic diseases. Even stronger links between education research and service delivery can optimise the health and wealth of the nation. I look for reassurance that there is an ongoing and, indeed, increasing commitment to this agenda.</p>

My interest in academic health partnerships arises from my time as a non-executive director at King's College Hospital and currently as an independent panel member of the National Institute for Health Research, and to that extent I declare an interest.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10112941000087"></a>The formation of King's Health Partnership was the result of an enormous amount of discussion and consultation among the foundation trusts of King's, Guy's, St Thomas's and SLAM, together with King's College London. It is not the first time there has been co-operation between universities and hospitals; it is a long and honourable tradition. What is new for this country is the extent to which that co-operation takes place. To integrate care, education and research through governance and staff co-operation is vital if patients are to receive the full benefit of the existing research which is taking place.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10112941000088"></a>While not attempting to claim that the King's Health Partnership is the only viable model, its networking approach has some huge advantages-buy-in from the staff, transparency and galvanising the support of the local communities in the area. AHSCs are important because of their potential for co-operation with the pharmaceutical industry and in attracting the best staff from home and abroad. In this, I add my plea to the Government that they will not stand in the way of attracting the world's best researchers and clinicians to this country. The intergovernment concession will not fit this particular case and it would be a tragedy if we

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10112941000089"></a>As a panel member for NIHR I can see for myself the wonderful work which is being done in this country by highly distinguished clinical academics, a significant number of them clustered around academic health science partnerships. Groundbreaking work is being done on Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and various forms of cancer which will be translated into treatments within the foreseeable future. However, some of this work is expensive and some of the research is not cost effective in terms of the tariff received. The AHSCs were established without any guarantee of extra money and have been consolidated through good will, commitment and a vision for the future. Unless the Government take these extra costs into consideration, it will be difficult to see how this good will and vision could continue indefinitely. I ask the Minister for an outline of the Government's commitment to the continuation of these partnerships and some information about how they intend to promote them.</p>

<a name="1011301000001"></a><b><a name="101129-0002.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="1011301000012"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> My Lords, I too want to express my appreciation to the noble Lady, Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, for obtaining this debate. As the terms of the motion are reasonably wide in referring to academic health partnerships, there are a number of elements that I would like to address briefly in the few minutes that are available to us.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="1011301000002"></a>When one thinks about academia, it seems to me that one should think not just of research but of the teaching of undergraduates that helps them to develop, of training-the clinical dimension of the work has to continue even in the postgraduate period-and, of course, of research. However, over the past 30 or so years, quite substantial changes have taken place in our approach to academic health partnerships. If one goes back 30 or 40 years, a great deal of academic work focused on medical practitioners who had a particular interest in and aptitude for this kind of work. Such practitioners spent part of their time employed by the National Health Service, largely, but they also did academic work, often with honorary contracts with universities.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="1011301000003"></a>Two or three major changes have occurred since then. One is that, as health trusts of various kinds-primary care trusts, hospital trusts, community trusts and so on-were set up and became increasingly business orientated and managerial in their approach, each trust looked at how far research was helpful to its own business plan. If the research was not directly productive, there was a disincentive to doctors to focus on research. As time has gone on, that has become an ever greater problem because doing research has itself become more difficult. There are many more ethical hoops-quite understandable in many cases, though not all-and funding has become more difficult. Junior medical staff, who might have been more than delighted to participate in research 20 or 30 years ago because it helped their curriculum vitae, now find that such research does not benefit them too much and it is much more difficult for them  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1345"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to find time for it. Research has become a much more difficult exercise with the increasing managerial approach in the NHS.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="1011301000004"></a>Universities, too, have had to look at whether or not they could be collaborative in that rather relaxed, laissez-faire way. Universities have demanded clinicians who focus very heavily on research and do well in the RAE, while NHS physicians have increasingly focused on their NHS clinical work. In addition, of course, there is now a much wider body of healthcare professionals involved in all these activities. The focus is not just on doctors but on the whole range of healthcare professionals-and quite rightly so-and that means that the picture has changed very dramatically. Meanwhile, the amount of resource available for research has not increased in a commensurate way. That is also true for teaching. Therefore, it has sometimes been the case that there has been a widening without necessarily a deepening of the quality of teaching and training.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="1011301000005"></a>It is not as though the new Government is coming to a situation in which everything has been perfect. In the past few years, there was a recognition of some of those issues by the previous Government. Following the Darzi report, the Government promoted some important centres of excellence, which have already been referred to in the debate and which are to be commended and supported. One of the concerns of the noble Lady is that the Government's proposals should take away nothing from the progress that has been made. I very much hope that my noble friend will be able to reassure us on that, because the White Paper makes clear that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="1011301000009"></a>"The department will continue to promote the role of Biomedical Research Centres and Units, Academic Health Science Centres"-</p>

<p><a name="1011301000006"></a>which were, of course, what came out of the Darzi report,</p>
<ul><a name="1011301000010"></a>"and Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, to develop research".</ul>
<p><a name="1011301000007"></a>At this stage, where change and development is being proposed, one wants to be reassured that those centres of excellence will indeed be built upon. There is, in fact, a tribute earlier in the White Paper to the importance of the work of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. I also note that specific emphasis is given to the NHS commissioning board taking some responsibility for promoting involvement in research and the use of research evidence.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="1011301000008"></a>However, although it is extremely important to ensure that the relatively small number of high quality centres of excellence is maintained, sustained and developed, that is not enough. There must be some way in which we can begin to rekindle the interest of young doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers and the panoply of health professionals to realise that research is an important component in their own professional development and that, if they are to understand the implications of research papers, they must have at least a little experience of research early on. Therefore, I seek some reassurance from my noble friend that, as we move forward into potentially exciting opportunities for a newly configured health service, we will try to regain some of the creative excitement about research and academic work of all kinds that I think has been somewhat lost in the overly managerial

I declare my own interest as a clinical academic and chairman for clinical quality at UCL Partners academic health science centre.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="1011306000002"></a>Healthcare systems around the world are facing considerable challenges. We know that in developing countries there is now an epidemic of diseases not previously experienced in those countries, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and so on. In our own healthcare system, we face similar challenges from chronic diseases that will need to be managed in an effective way, frequently with attention on prevention rather than just on treatment. We also still face serious disparities in access to healthcare, clinical outcomes, escalating costs for healthcare and variable quality across the healthcare system, as we have seen this past weekend with the publication of the Dr Foster report on adverse events experienced throughout the healthcare system in England.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="1011306000003"></a>Over the past 50 years, many of the advances that have helped us to improve outcomes and the quality of care that we provide to patients have been academically led. There is a growing recognition that the contribution of academic medicine is potentially even greater now than in previous decades because the challenges that we face are much greater. As we have heard, there is a developing movement throughout the world, certainly in mature healthcare systems, for the development of academic health science centres, which are well placed to face the challenges that have been identified as the pathway of discovery care. That continuum needs to be bridged to ensure that research activity, stimulated by endeavour, careful thought and intellectual enterprise, can be converted into new interventions, therapies and systems and into pathways of healthcare to improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="1011306000004"></a>It is now well recognised that there are two important gaps that academic medicine and institutions can overcome in this discovery care continuum. The first is the gap characterised as "from bench to bedside", taking those discoveries and having appropriate translation medicine to ensure that those discoveries can be tested and presented to the wider clinical audience-clinical colleagues and other healthcare professionals, as we have heard-in such a way that they might be adopted to improve clinical care and outcomes.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="1011306000005"></a>The second gap is to move from a very difficult place where there is expert acceptance of the discoveries and their evaluation from basic and clinical research, and to ensure that those are broadly adopted. Indeed, it is quite shocking-here I must declare a further interest as director of the Thrombosis Research Institute in London, which is involved in many collaborative research programmes with industry in the area of thrombosis-that this weekend we saw, in the Dr Foster analysis of adverse events in our healthcare system, some 62,800 reported adverse events, 30,500 of which were deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1347"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is quite striking as we have known for over 30 years, thanks to research, much of which was conducted in the institute that I am now director of, that there are simple ways to assess patients at risk of thromboembolism and simple methods that can be applied to those at risk to reduce their risk of developing a blood clot while in hospital or soon after being discharged. It is well recognised by experts. We have guidelines. Indeed, we have the active programme from the Department of Health in this area. There is still a gap, however, in its widespread adoption. I very strongly believe that academic health science systems have an important role to play in overcoming this gap and ensuring that what we understand can be applied not only in single institutions but broadly across healthcare systems to improve clinical outcomes, and in ensuring that the research effort is properly applied to benefit the largest number of potential patients.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="1011306000006"></a>We have also heard that there are important economic benefits to be derived from having a strong academic clinical base. One of the purposes of the five academic health science centres, which we have heard about previously in this debate, is to ensure that the United Kingdom remains an important target for inward investment by the bio-pharmaceutical industry for research and that the opportunity to collaborate with industry delivers not only clinical benefit for our patients but economic benefit for our country.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="1011306000007"></a>Will the Minister confirm-I am sure this is the case-that academic health science centres remain at the very heart of Her Majesty's Government's agenda for healthcare and ensuring that we can achieve the very best clinical outcomes, quality, access and value in our healthcare system? Will he also confirm that the opportunity will be taken to explore whether the remit of academic health science centres can be explored so that they focus much more on becoming academic health science systems across entire sectors or health economies, driving the potential for broader integration-both vertical integration across primary, secondary and tertiary care, and horizontal integration, as we have done at UCL Partners-in developing provider networks that are focused not on the outcomes that an individual institution can achieve but on the outcomes that are achievable across the entire patient pathway and are focused on improving clinical outcomes for the continuum of care, particularly for the management of patients with chronic conditions? Will he also confirm that we will look at how academic health science systems can facilitate primary care commissioning as that moves forward and is developed in the coming years, and that we will continue to ensure that the contributions that the United Kingdom can make globally to academic health science systems and centres are maintained and that our country continues to benefit from participation in those systems and centres?</p>

It is also a pleasure to follow my noble friend Lord Kakkar, whose professional interests, as he has explained, lie in north London but whose personal interests lie, like mine, in south London.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1348"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-0002.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="1011306000009"></a>The question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is how the Government propose to preserve academic health partnerships. I should declare an interest as chair of King's Health Partners, one of the five national AHSCs about which the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, has already spoken so fluently. Indeed, I endorse everything that she said. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, was right to emphasise the great advantages that Britain has in contributing academic research to medicine and how this country punches above its weight in those areas. As the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, said, this is not only a benefit to health treatment but an enormous economic benefit through the investment of big pharma in this country. Perhaps that investment is second only to financial services in its importance to the economy of the country. But it is fragile, and we have already seen some signs of that fragility with GSK's decision to move many of its activities to Shanghai and Merck's departure. We must strive to maintain this country's attraction for big pharmaceutical companies. It is very reassuring that the Government recognise that. The emphasis on the importance of research in the Government's White Paper is also greatly welcome.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="1011306000010"></a>As other speakers have said, the five AHSCs are among the most valuable instruments for bringing together academia and the National Health Service, which might, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said, have drifted away from each other somewhat in the past 15 years. I pay tribute to the steps that the previous Government took to reverse that trend, not least by establishing the AHSCs. To reflect on the partnership with which I am associated, what does that partnership bring together? In King's College London, it brings an outstanding research university and a leading medical training institution; in Guy's and St Thomas' and King's College Hospital, it brings two of the world's leading teaching and clinical care hospitals; and in the South London and Maudsley Hospital, it brings one of the nation's leading psychiatric hospitals.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="1011306000011"></a>I invite the House to consider what we can achieve in modern healthcare by closer links between those institutions. First, as has been mentioned, we can bring research and clinical care closer together, and accelerate the translation of the very exciting discoveries that are made all the time in research to the care of the patient.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="1011306000012"></a>Secondly, there can be a closer link between mental and physical care. I particularly emphasise this in the case of the partnership with which I am associated. It is a weakness of our present system that psychological morbidity in patients with physical illness and physical morbidity in patients with mental illness have not been sufficiently recognised and addressed.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="1011306000013"></a>Thirdly, there are the integrated pathways of care for patients. This is, I think, very close to the Government's heart and their policy in the White Paper. Like the other two London AHSCs, King's Health Partners is working with local GPs and local authorities to establish new models of preventive medicine and community care, as well as tertiary care.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="1011306000014"></a>Finally, there can be more effective medical training not only through the university and teaching hospitals but in the community through the health innovation  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1349"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and education cluster-the HIEC-for which King's Health Partners has been given the lead for south London.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="1011306000015"></a>This link between research and clinical treatment is personified in the chief executive of King's Health Partners, Professor Robert Lechler. He is not only a distinguished researcher and clinician at Guy's Hospital but vice-principal of the university. This link is repeated in many others who hold joint appointments in the university and member hospitals. The challenge for the AHSCs is to realise the opportunities that these existing links represent.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="1011306000016"></a>As has been mentioned, the previous Government, in setting up the AHSCs, did not give them any extra funds, unlike the Dutch Government, who recognise the importance of their equivalent of AHSCs through higher-intensity payments for them. Despite the lack of a financial incentive, when I came into this work, I, like others who have spoken, was hugely impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment not only of the four partner institutions in the AHSC with which I am associated but also-again, this has been mentioned-among the world-renowned researchers and clinicians who form part of them. This really is a movement that is supported at the grassroots level by those who work in the field. Like others, I hope the Minister will be able to say tonight that the Government endorse the objectives that I have described and see AHSCs as crucial to achieving them.</p>

As has so often happened in the past, the noble Earl and I are usually, or probably, the least qualified people to answer this debate, given the quality of the contributions that have been made this evening. I particularly thank my noble friend Baroness Donaghy for her thoughtful contribution.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="1011306000018"></a>Evidence from around the world demonstrates the profound role played by world-class research and teaching in driving innovation in healthcare. Academic health science centres are designed to maximise clinical and academic synergies by ensuring that clinical research and teaching staff work in concert to unified plans that transcend the separate structures of their respective clinical and academic institutions. In 2007 a review of healthcare in London led my noble friend Lord Darzi in a framework for action to recommend the creation of a number of academic health partnerships. In October 2007 Imperial College Healthcare became the first to be established in the UK when Imperial College London's faculty of medicine merged with the Hammersmith Hospital and St Mary's Hospital NHS trusts. I know that several more-mentioned by other noble Lords-have subsequently been established, notably Cambridge University Health Partners, King's Health Partners, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, UCL Partners, Barts and The London NHS Trust.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="1011306000019"></a>We can be proud of the achievements of these innovative partnerships and the benefits that they have brought in their own areas to the cities that they are in and across the world. The engines of clinical innovation-  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1350"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for example, at Barts and The London-will be 70 new clinical academic units, clusters of closely related specialties or sub-specialities working to a single plan for clinical care research and teaching. For example, guests from all over the world flew to London the week before last for the opening of a new cardiovascular biomedical research unit at the Royal Brompton Hospital. The BRU is a joint initiative between the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College London and puts the partnership at the forefront of international research into the most challenging heart conditions. It is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="1011306000020"></a>There appear to be three legs to the AHSC stool. For it to work properly it needs excellent education, excellent healthcare and excellent research. It also needs time. This is not a five-year project; this is a 15 to 20-year shift in the development of excellence and innovation in these areas. My understanding is that the funding of the academic health science centres is a mixture of MRC, DBIS and NIHR. Under the current structure, SHAs and PCTs have delegated responsibility to administer research funding. In addition to his powers to conduct or assist research, the Secretary of State has a duty under Section 258 of the 2006 Act to ensure that facilities are made available for universities with medical or dentist schools in connection with clinical teaching and the research connected with clinical medicine or clinical dentistry. This duty is delegated to the strategic health authorities and PCTs under the regulations.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="1011306000021"></a>Therefore, my first question to the Minister-echoed around the House-is unsurprisingly: how will this particular aspect be delivered and funding allocated under the new NHS structure? Who will undertake these duties with the demise of the strategic health authorities and PCTs? Linked to that, we need to ask about workforce planning. As many noble Lords have mentioned, clinical academics need to be fed through to these bodies. How will that happen?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="1011306000022"></a>The British Medical Association has recommended consideration of the roles of networks, health innovation and education clusters and the National Institute for Health Research and how these will fit into the Government's overall plans. Can the noble Earl assure the House that the funding for the National Institute for Health Research is, indeed, safe?</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="1011306000023"></a>On the necessity for ensuring excellence in education, we also need to look at the implications of the Browne review of university funding because we need to know how the leg that concerns teaching and universities will be affected. Presumably the cutbacks in the funding of higher education will have an impact on AHSCs in relationships with universities as they collaborate with them. There is the potential for a double whammy here, both in costs to individual students and, indeed, in the cutbacks that universities are to suffer as a result of the CSR settlement. Like other noble Lords, I welcome the fact that research has been protected under the CSR, but it seems to me that at least two legs of this stool are looking a bit dodgy. I invite the Minister to tell the House how the Government intend to support the future of these partnerships in the long term.</p>

She is absolutely right to highlight the essential links between universities and the NHS as well as the importance of medical research and education which are, as she so eloquently described, essential for the ongoing success of the UK economy and of a high-quality NHS. The Government absolutely recognise and support the need to maintain investment in these areas for the benefit of patients.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="1011306000025"></a>The noble Baroness raised a number of specific issues to which I will respond in a moment. It is right to remind ourselves that most of the issues that have been raised should be considered within the context of the UK. Although there will be shared principles across the four Administrations, we are also dealing with devolved matters. However, my responses today will inevitably deal with England alone.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="1011306000026"></a>Since the NHS was founded in 1948, investment in health research has brought incalculable benefits for patients. Treatments have been improved, inequalities have been reduced and productivity has increased. In both the strategic spending review and our White Paper, <I>Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS</I>, we have emphasised the importance of research, as the noble Baroness rightly noted. Despite the incredibly challenging pressure on budgets across government, we are committed to increasing spending on health research over the next four years. When funds are tight is precisely the time when innovation, investigation and invention become most valuable. In the long term, research saves money and allows us to identify new ways of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease. It is essential if we are to increase the quality and productivity of the NHS, which are, after all, the best ways of making savings.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="1011306000027"></a>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will ensure that Medical Research Council expenditure is maintained, ensuring that total health research funding will increase. Among other things, the extra funding will support the National Institute for Health Research. I was grateful to the noble Baroness for her appreciation of the NIHR's work and, indeed, to other noble Lords for the tributes which they paid to it. Through the NIHR, the Department of Health spends more than £50 million every year to fund posts aimed at encouraging junior doctors to pursue clinical research careers. Through the intrinsic bond between the NHS and universities, the NIHR is turning laboratory-based discoveries into cutting-edge treatments that make a real difference to people's lives. Through its internationally recognised biomedical research centres and units, the NIHR is helping to translate pure research into practical success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="1011306000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, referred to academic health science centres, in particular the King's Health Partners, and that was a theme strongly taken up by the noble Lords, Lord Kakkar and Lord Butler, among others. As the noble Lord, Lord Butler, said, there are now five academic health science centres in  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1352"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>England. Their core mission is to bring together world-class research, teaching and patient care in order to speed up the process of translating developments in research into benefits for patients, both in the NHS and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, across the world.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="1011306000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, referred to the UK as a target for inward investment in these areas. He will be interested to know that we are taking forward a range of measures to promote and develop the UK as a place for inward investment by global industry through the Office for Life Sciences and the health and business departments. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, referred, I think in passing, to funding for academic health science centres. It is worth pointing out that AHSCs are underpinned by funding from NIHR as well as the research councils and other funding sources.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="1011306000030"></a>The coalition Government confirmed in the White Paper that they see an important role for AHSCs in delivering the translational research agenda, unlocking synergies between research, education and patient care. As regards their potential development as institutions, which the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, invited us to consider, as he knows, AHSC status was awarded in March 2009 for a period of five years and will be subject to review. However, we will be working with interested parties to determine the next steps for AHSCs, and I take his suggestions fully on board.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="1011306000031"></a>For now, I think it is right for me to acknowledge that the organisations in AHSC partnerships are already making extremely impressive contributions to the translational endeavour. Our announcements in the spending review will allow us all to work even harder to ensure that the breakthroughs made by our world-class scientists are pulled through into real benefits for patients. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, referred briefly to mental health research, and he was right to pinpoint that area as one on which we should focus. The Department of Health is the largest UK funder of mental health research, and our investment in research infrastructure is having a significant and positive impact on the numbers of patients recruited to clinical trials in this area.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="1011306000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, referred very eloquently to the process of promoting translation from bench to bedside and into widespread adoption. I can confirm that undoubtedly the AHSCs have a role to play in crossing those translation gaps. Together with the NIHR investment in biological research councils, biological research units, and collaborations for leadership in applied health research and care, I am confident that we can make a real impact on getting cutting-edge ideas faster into improving health. We will continue to promote the role of BRUs, BRCs, academic health science centres and collaborations for leadership in applied health research and care, all of which can help develop research and unlock the synergies to which I referred earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="1011306000033"></a>In England there are also 17 health innovation and education clusters, which are cross-sector partnerships between NHS organisations, the higher education sector and industry. Their task is to bring quickly the benefits of research and innovation directly to patients. They will also strengthen the co-ordination of education  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1353"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1353</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and training, and bring together those responsible for healthcare with the local academic community. Currently in their first year, they focus on a variety of healthcare themes in line with local strategic objectives. We need to reward locally relevant, high-impact work and to encourage partnerships with industry. Through HEFCE's research excellence framework, we will continue to develop an assessment framework that rewards the impact that the highest levels of research excellence have on society and on the wider economy.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="1011306000034"></a>I doubt that many people do not also recognise the importance of medical education. It ensures that the next generation of clinicians develops skills and expertise to meet patients' needs. Linked to this is the complex area of workforce planning-to which the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, referred-to ensure that we have the right numbers with the right skills in the right places. Aligning workforce planning and education, both in universities and in postgraduate medical training, must be considered in the context of the White Paper proposals and of our forthcoming consultation on education and training. The White Paper reforms are bold, and the way that we plan and develop the healthcare workforce needs to respond to and support the reforms, and align with new ways of commissioning and providing services. There is an opportunity now to review and fundamentally reshape the whole system for planning and developing the workforce. The Government have committed to consult widely on the design of a new framework for education and training. We will publish a consultation document shortly. The new system will be driven by patients' needs, led by healthcare providers and underpinned by strong clinical leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="1011306000035"></a>There has been concern in some circles about ensuring that graduates of UK medical schools are able to obtain full registration with the GMC by securing a place on the first year of the foundation programme. To date, this has always been the case. Although there have been more applicants to the programme for 2011, the programme office has predicted that all eligible applicants will secure a place.</p>

<a name="101129-0002.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="1011306000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, also correctly highlighted the vital role that medical schools will play in preparing medical students for a future where a greater proportion of care will be delivered in the community. However, it is not only in medical schools that the emphasis on community care needs to change, but also in postgraduate medical training. That has been recognised in the priorities of the Government's advisory body, Medical Education England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="1011306000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked what levers would be in the new system to encourage research and innovation. My noble friend Lord Alderdice was absolutely right: it is largely thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and to Dame Sally Davies in the department that these levers exist and will continue to operate. I have referred to a number of the ways in which the NIHR is continuing to support the system-not least the BRCs, BRUs and so on-by pulling through ideas from the laboratory into new approaches to healthcare. It is through these and the AHSCs that we will continue to see a drive to research and innovation in the new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="1011306000038"></a>My noble friend Lord Alderdice referred to the NHS Commissioning Board commissioning research. We expect that the board will promote the conduct of research and patient participation. He also rightly said that we need to encourage excitement among young clinicians. I fully agree: that is one reason why the NIHR is funding so many new clinical academic fellowships every year, which enable young clinicians to get enthused by this career path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="1011306000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, stressed the need for effective joint working between the Department of Health, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and other key partners. She is of course quite right. The Health and Education National Strategic Exchange provides a national forum where senior members of the higher education and health sectors discuss strategic issues and influence cross-government working. However, I of course agree that such links should be strengthened where possible in order to maintain our proud tradition of high-quality medical education and research, the purpose of which is, above all, to benefit patients.</p>

Essentially, this is a probing amendment, but it raises some rather wider issues. I am very grateful to see the noble Lord, Lord Henley, on the Front Bench. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is quite pleased to see him on the Front Bench as well, because clearly, these matters are in the Defra area but, as I said, raise wider issues. Those wider issues are: why are those two committees being abolished when many other similar committees are not being touched; and in what way will they be abolished?</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="1011306000041"></a>I must apologise to the Committee, because I was not here earlier today to speak to an amendment in my name, but my noble friend Lady Henig moved it ably. She pointed out that the list in Schedule 1 includes apples and pears-this is not a horticultural question but because they are not like with like. The Government propose that some of those bodies in Schedule 1 be abolished; that some of them revert to Ministers; and that some have their powers and functions moved to other bodies, public and private. It is not clear what will happen to the independent advisory capacity of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances. If they are to be abolished, full stop, that raises a serious issue.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1355"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="1011306000042"></a>I declare a current interest as a member of the Environment Agency board, which has relations with both those committees, but, more particularly, because I am a former Minister dealing with much of the Minister's current portfolio, and specifically with the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. It was always important to have independent advice. Pesticides have always been a controversial area. If the powers revert to the Minister, the Minister will be seriously-if he will excuse the expression-exposed in this area. It is very important also that advice is independent and is seen to be independent. Of course, the Minister does not have to accept any advisory committee's advice. When I was in the noble Lord's position, there were times when I did not accept the advice of the pesticides committee and indeed referred the issue of bystanders and their vulnerability to pesticide exposure to what I felt was the higher authority of the Royal Society. That is a matter for the Minister to decide.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="1011306000043"></a>If we abolish these committees and all assessment reverts to the Minister and his civil servants then you lose that independent advice, or do the Government intend to transfer the responsibilities of these committees elsewhere, to other bodies? For example the Environment Agency and the HSE have some responsibilities in this area. Alternatively, the Minister could, I guess, invent a non-statutory body of experts to advise. That has slightly less of an independent air than these two bodies.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="1011306000044"></a>I think it would be somewhat dangerous if Ministers decided they were going to go for a more informal arrangement in relation to the whole array of scientific advisory bodies, which exist right across departments and certainly very substantially in Defra. It is dangerous for Ministers as well. The Committtee on Hazardous Substances advises Ministers on dangerous chemicals in air, water and the soil, and on nanomaterials, which have a significant element of controversy, in relation to policy and science and the effect of some of these substances.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="1011306000045"></a>Pesticides are also a crucial area because there is a conflict of interests here. There is conflict between the farmers and the agriculturalists and the horticulturalists on one side and local residents and those pursuing other pursuits, and environmentalists and environmental bodies concerned with air and water quality and food standards, food quality and the effect on biodiversity and so forth.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="1011306000046"></a>The Minister has to balance the different interests in this area and it is helpful if he has advice which is independent and statutorily-based as one part of his decision-making process. The Minister also has a significant Civil Service element. The pesticides safety division in Defra is a very effective body. However, it looks at systems and monitoring and what is happening in regulations. Of course regulations in this context are quite often European regulations. Some of the most controversial proposals in the pesticides field are in European regulations that are coming on stream. Some elements of the agricultural industry think they will eliminate pesticides in particular specialist areas, so there is quite a delicate political balance in that respect.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1356"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="1011306000047"></a>It is not just farmers who are affected by this. Quite a lot of pesticides are used in parks and gardens, so there is a big public sector element that has to follow the advice. It would be better if the Minister, when making the regulations, was basing them on the advice of a publicly defensible independent body. All of us who are occasional gardeners are affected by this as well. In some ways the most dangerous area is in people's own gardens. While the pesticides advisory committee and the PSD will have a whole list of pesticides you are no longer expected to use, I am pretty confident that at least one of my neighbours has a shed load of pesticides that are probably banned by the Geneva Convention, never mind the pesticide regulations. Enforcing it in these areas is quite an important role, so that the public are informed as well as those who have an interest in horticulture and agriculture.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="1011306000048"></a>There is a very good and very specific reason why the pesticides advisory committee should remain independent, should remain statutorily-based and should give protection to the Minister and his colleagues. It is also slightly odd that these two committees are the only advisory committees in the Defra family scheduled for abolition. Yet Defra has, I think, 20-odd committees, including the Food Standards Agency and about another dozen of a similar status to these two committees.</p>
<a name="time_36"></a>
<a name="101129-0003.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="1011306000063"></a>9.30 pm</h5>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="1011306000049"></a>These two committees are not quite the first two on the list alphabetically, but the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances is the first. I just wonder if, in this less than totally objective assessment of which quangos to get rid of, Defra officials looked at the list and decided that we could quite easily do without two in the first four as compared with the others. But there are other important expert panels and advisory committees on air quality and farm welfare. There is another one on pesticides, the Pesticides Residues Committee, and others on particular diseases. All those are apparently untouched, as are the advisory committees in most other government departments with one or two exceptions-they are not being abolished, modified, transferred or merged.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="1011306000050"></a>Going back to my more general point, in a sense, I would have thought that it would be useful if the Government, before this Bill passes much further, were able to give an indication of their overall attitude to statutorily-based advisory committees, particularly scientific ones. Picking off a couple does not seem a very rational approach. It may be that there is some rationality behind it, but I have not yet seen it. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us in a moment. It is important that this House is convinced that those bodies on the list, particularly the list for total abolition, should be there for a reason. We would like to be reassured that the Government are still committed to independent statutorily-based advice across the board. That involves not only the Defra committees and the food standards committees, but all departments.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="1011306000051"></a>I hope that the Minister will give us more of an explanation tonight, but I also think that it would help him and his colleagues if we were to receive at some point during these proceedings-obviously, had we  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1357"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gone to a Select Committee it would have been much easier to do-an indication of the Government's total approach to independent scientific advice. Is their objection to these committees based on them being statutory and independent or do they think that they genuinely no longer have a positive role?</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="1011306000052"></a>I shall raise just one other point. The way in which this is listed suggests that the equivalent advisory committee for Northern Ireland is also abolished in the same paragraph. Both agriculture and environment are devolved matters in Northern Ireland. I do not quite understand why they are therefore on the agenda for abolition in the Westminster Parliament when the Northern Ireland Assembly is surely the body which should decide whether that body should continue to exist or otherwise. That is a relatively minor point, but it is important for the farming community of Northern Ireland. I hope that the noble Lord will give us an indication of why we are dealing with that committee here. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="1011306000053"></a><b><a name="101129-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1011306000070"></a>Lord Knight of Weymouth:</b> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Whitty. I, too, am a former Minister at Defra, although we did not manage to coincide: I came after my noble friend moved on to other things. The points that he makes in his speech and through his amendments are important. On looking at the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances, I see that the intention is for it to become a committee of experts working directly to the department. At one level, the difference between having it as a non-departmental public body or having it internalised within Defra looks fairly finely balanced, if the same people are providing advice on the same sorts of things to the same Ministers. Indeed, I note from the website that the secretariat to the NDPB is within Defra anyway. On all those levels it might not make much difference. I would be interested in the Minister's response as to how much financial saving might be made in terms of these changes to these two committees so that we can judge whether that is part of the motivation.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="1011306000054"></a>In the end when I looked at it and tried to understand why these changes were thought necessary for Defra, like my noble friend I concluded that it must be something to do with the arm's-length nature and the independence of the scientific advice. In that respect, this is a very important principle around whether or not that scientific advice should be independent of any other interests within the department. My experience from a year within Defra is that there are considerable, highly vocal, well organised interests that exercise Ministers and it is helpful at times to be able to have that independence.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="1011306000055"></a>By way of illustrating it, I refer to a story not from this country but from India around what happened to the vulture population, which collapsed by about 95 per cent in a very short period. As a result of having very few vultures to feed off the carcasses of cattle that were left out for the vultures because of the cultural issues in India around cattle, there was a population explosion of feral dogs in India-about 5.5 million more than usual-because they had this free food to sup on. And as a result of more feral dogs, more people were getting bitten. It is estimated that  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1358"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>just under 50,000 more people died of rabies in India because of this explosion in the feral dog population. Meanwhile, others suffered from leopards attacking urban areas because the leopards expanded in population in order to pursue the dogs. In the end people were obviously concerned as to why the vultures had died. It came down to the improper use of chemicals-of diclofenac, the anti-inflammatory drug that was being fed to cattle by farmers, perfectly innocently, but which caused instant renal failure within the vulture population. It is the most extraordinary example of how an ecosystem can work and have an impact on a human population as well as on biodiversity, and indeed it is a fantastic example of the importance of biodiversity to us wherever we are in the world. But it is equally an important example of how agricultural vested interests should be kept separate from analysis of chemicals and pesticides.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="1011306000056"></a>I am not suggesting we might have that scenario playing out here, but you never know. I put it to the Minister, in using that example, that independent scientific advice at arm's length is lost at a cost. If he could tell us what the saving is, if that is the motivation, then I am sure we would be very grateful.</p>

<a name="1011307000001"></a><b><a name="101129-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="1011307000028"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> My Lords, my noble friends have set out very well the argument against the abolition of the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="1011307000002"></a>I compare the proposed abolition of the two committees with the recently announced cancellation of the Food Standards Agency. To a non-scientist like me, such abolition can only mean that in future people's diets in schools and elsewhere will be more controlled by the burger manufacturers. Ours is the second most obese country in the world after the United States of America, but that situation looks like it will only get worse rather than better. If the Government's intention in abolishing the committees is to have less government and to allow the industry to take its course, there will clearly be a risk that the manufacturers of these products-nasty or otherwise-could populate any committees that the Minister may create with academics who are funded by their companies. There is a great danger that we could end up in a similar situation to the one that both my noble friends have outlined.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="1011307000003"></a>The independence of such committees is absolutely fundamental. I hope that the Minister can give us confidence that their scientific independence will be preserved. As I have said, the precedent of the Food Standards Agency is extremely important. People will probably only get fat and die sooner without the FSA, whereas the abolition of these two committees will probably have a much more urgent effect. However, a similar principle is involved. I look forward to his comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="1011307000005"></a>Like my noble friend, I am glad that the Minister who is to reply is from Defra. Given the large number of bodies being modified or abolished by this Bill that  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1359"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are part of Defra's area of responsibility, it is good that the Minister is responding to the debate on these bodies and, I hope, on the other agricultural bodies listed in the Bill. Given the many bodies that are listed in Schedule 1 that the Government are to have the power to abolish, it is absolutely right that each body should be looked at in turn. In many cases, the bodies in question have existed for a long time, so there certainly needs to be proper consultation about their future and how their work, especially when that is evaluated as having been very valuable, can be taken forward.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="1011307000006"></a>First, perhaps I may ask a few questions about the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances. The committee not only has a distinguished membership but holds regular meetings and has produced a large number of reports, which I understand have been accessed by many people. The committee has also been very open about its proceedings. I notice that, when Defra first announced the changes to arm's-length bodies on 22 July, the Secretary of State-the queen of the quango cutters-said that she intended that, as a result of the proposed changes, the subjects covered by such bodies would be dealt with more openly. Having looked at the website for the Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances, I find it hard to imagine how much more open it could be. Its agendas, minutes and proceedings are made fully available. I understand that it has held a number of public meetings and that it expects-if it is allowed to do so-to hold such meetings in the future. Indeed, I understand that the next public meeting is scheduled for 7 December. Will that be an occasion when the future of the organisation could be aired publicly? Indeed, will the Government be involved in that meeting by giving their view on how a successor organisation might look?</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="1011307000007"></a>I turn to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. Given that the committee was set up in 1985 following legislation by the then Conservative Government, it is fair to ask a Conservative Minister why it is no longer felt necessary to have such a committee. As my noble friends have said, there is a great deal of public concern about pesticides, the use of which can give rise to many problems, particularly if they are not properly evaluated and subject to appropriate expertise at every stage. As my noble friend Lord Berkeley mentioned, we need to consider how bodies such as the Advisory Committee on Pesticides overlap with organisations such as the Food Standards Agency. The Advisory Committee on Pesticides is concerned not only with the use of pesticides on food and agricultural products but with the health of creatures and plants. The Government are required to consult the committee in certain circumstances. Could the Minister tell us how useful that process of consultation has been?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="1011307000008"></a>Both my noble friend Lord Whitty and my noble friend Lord Knight spoke of the importance of independent and impartial advice for Ministers. As a former Minister myself, I feel very strongly about that. In the weight of business that one faces within a ministerial department, it is very easy to get overwhelmed even from advice from within the department. Former

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="1011307000009"></a>Finally, given that the Advisory Committee on Pesticides for Northern Ireland is also included, that allows me to ask how much contact there has been with devolved Administrations on the abolition of these bodies and their replacement with something different-by expert committees, as my noble friend Lord Knight referred to. How do the Government envisage taking these issues forward in Northern Ireland? What discussions has the Minister had with Northern Ireland Ministers about the proposal?</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="1011307000010"></a>How will the expert committees that will replace those bodies function? I ask not only in terms of openness but whether there will be a general continuity in the work of the existing bodies and in the membership of the organisations. There are a number of such questions on which we seek assurance, so I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="1011307000012"></a>The noble Baroness also said that some of these bodies have existed for a very long time indeed. I suppose she was appealing to my nature as a hard-line reactionary Conservative who does not want to see anything change at all. I see the noble Lord nodding in agreement-the arch reactionary here speaks. I am not sure that I am. Things do move on and from time to time we have to change them. For that reason I will not be able to support the noble Baroness in saying that everything should continue as it is just because it always has existed in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="1011307000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Knight of Weymouth, talked about vultures and leopards. I saw one of his noble colleagues, on the edge of the Chamber, who found some of these remarks faintly comic. He should not have done; I did not find them comic because the points were serious. For some reason, when you hear remarks about vultures in this House late at night-well, I think all noble Lords know what I mean. I will certainly take on board the points the noble Lord was making.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="1011307000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, spoke about the Food Standards Agency and asked if we are going to populate these bodies with the wrong people. That is certainly not going to be the case and I hope to deal with that when I deal with the substance of the amendments.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="1011307000015"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for moving these amendments. I appreciate there are four of us who have served in Defra or its former bodies, so we all know what it is like.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="1011307000016"></a>The first point I should make is that the bodies are listed in alphabetical order and we are now dealing with the first of the Defra organisations; there will be others later as we work through Schedule 1, as the noble Lord knows. He also knows perfectly well that theirs is not the only advice that Ministers receive-I was grateful that he stressed this-and that when Ministers receive advice from such bodies they are not bound to accept it. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Knight, for nodding his head on this point. In the end, Ministers of whatever persuasion have to make a decision. They take advice from all kinds of experts and then make a decision. I believe one of my colleagues, who is not in this House, wrote a book on the subject called <I>Ministers Decide</I>, or something like that, but we all write books of that kind.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="1011307000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred to the problems that neighbours might have with the some of the things we use in gardens. At that point one thought, "Gosh, what about North Korea?". However, I take on board what the noble Lord had to say about the problems that different things can cause in different ways.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="1011307000018"></a>The amendment seeks to remove the three committees-it relates also to the Northern Ireland committee-from Schedule 1 so that we would not be able to abolish them. I shall set out why we wish to abolish them and explain how we wish their work to continue. I acknowledge that those committees have provided independent, expert and impartial advice to Governments of all political persuasions on hazardous chemicals and pesticides. That advice continues to be of value and I can assure the Committee and all noble Lords that abolition of these three committees in their current form will enable us to put in place better arrangements for the work to continue through expert scientific committees.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="1011307000019"></a>This reflects the work that the Cabinet Office has been doing with Sir John Beddington, the government Chief Scientific Adviser and the head of the Government Office for Science, and departments to identify more accountable and effective ways to deliver independent, high-quality scientific advice to government to meet the objectives of the public bodies reform programme and the principles of scientific advice to government.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="1011307000020"></a>We also need to recognise that statutory regimes for hazardous chemicals and pesticides are increasingly driven by EU legislation. Those three expert committees will remain independent and be able to put advice direct to Ministers, where appropriate, and will adhere carefully to the government code of practice for scientific and advisory committees.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="1011307000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Knight, asked what savings would be available as a result of this. I wish to make it clear to the noble Lord that we are not looking particularly for savings; the savings, in fact, will be negligible. We are reorganising how the department commissions and applies scientific evidence and looking at ways to do this more coherently and efficiently. These bodies are being reconstituted as expert scientific committees to the department rather than as statutory NDPBs. That will allow them to provide better advice to us in  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1362"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column 1362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an equally independent way without any particular savings. I hope the noble Lord will accept that.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="1011307000022"></a>With that explanation, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment at this stage. Failing that, we will have to look at it again at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="1011307000023"></a><b><a name="101129-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1011307000031"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining some of the background to this. It was intended as a probing amendment and I think that we have probed something out of it. The Minister said in the latter part of his remarks that this was part of a discussion of the best way to deliver scientific advice, in conjunction with the Cabinet Office and the Chief Secretary. My query arose not so much because I want everything to be set in aspic and that no change should take place, but because there should be a rationale for it. After the Minister's remarks I still do not quite understand why these two committees, both of which are particularly sensitive in a political and media way, do not deserve a clearly statutorily-based form of advice, whereas a significant number of the rest of Defra's advisory committees are not on this list, and, if you took it across Whitehall, obviously the picture is wider.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="1011307000024"></a>This is why I argued that, in order to have this debate on a rational basis, we need some background from the Minister, or the Minister for Science or from BIS saying what our overall approach to advisory committees is. If it is, in general, that we move away from statutorily-based committees to expert panels, there may be an argument for that. The problem is that we have not heard that argument and that this seems to be differentially applied to bodies within the same department, let alone across Whitehall as a whole. There is a much bigger issue behind this that, at some point, the House is going to have to look at before we can easily give our consent to including some of these bodies on one or other of the schedules to the Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="1011307000025"></a>I am glad that the Minister has, in a sense, opened that up, because maybe there is a bigger background that we will come back to at a later stage of the Bill. I am certainly not utterly convinced that the expert panel is much different from a statutory body in terms of the quality of its advice or procedures and, clearly, there is no great cost advantage. I still think that Ministers have, themselves, the protection that, if there is a statutory body giving them advice, at least that part of their advice is clear. Where there are other aspects to it and they take a different decision, that is a separate matter.</p>

<a name="101129-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="1011307000026"></a>Clearly, I have opened up something here and I am glad that I have. For tonight, I will withdraw the amendment, but I think that we will probably be returning to this, or a wider debate.</p>

It would have been impossible to have prepared a reaction to the Autumn Statement in time without her indulgence, for which I am most grateful.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000005"></a>There is an inconsistency in the Bill, which Amendments 1, 3 and 4 in my name are designed to correct. The inconsistency derives from the fact that the charter, which is referred to in Clause 1, is supposed to provide guidance as to the main duties outlined in Clause 4. Clause 4 lists those duties as sustainability, fiscal forecasts and economic forecasts, yet Clause 1 calls for guidance only on fiscal and sustainability issues; it makes no mention of economic issues. That is the core inconsistency.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000006"></a>The issue to be addressed is rather more than formal, as sustainability issues and, indeed, fiscal balance are not independent of economic performance. For example, it is quite possible to have a sustainable very small state or a sustainable very large state. Equally, it is possible to have a sustainable stagnant economy and a sustainable dynamic economy; in fact, I am sure that that is what the Minister would claim the coalition is creating. More specifically, different assumptions about the performance of the world economy as a whole will impact on the fiscal forecast and on any concept of sustainability. If we are to provide consistent advice in the charter to the Office for Budget Responsibility under its duties in Clause 4, the amendments in my name, which would introduce the word "economic" into the clauses, should be accepted.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000007"></a>Moreover, the charter introduces a fourth element, which is the promotion of "intergenerational fairness". It would be helpful if the Minister could, when he sums up, define exactly what this means. Perhaps I could help by setting out what it cannot mean. It  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cannot have anything to do with the fiscal balance as such, as the size of a deficit defines the content of redistribution between different groups of current and future generations of UK citizens-essentially, redistribution between taxpayers and lenders. It certainly has nothing whatever to do with redistribution between generations. What it can mean is that there is some impact on investment and the growth path of the economy, but that is very much economic policy-the very dimension that has been left out of Clause 1. That is why I want to introduce the word "economic" into Clause 1. I believe that this is exactly the point that my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Barnett make in their amendment in this group. To make this entire story consistent across Clauses 1 and 4 and the reference to the promotion of intergenerational fairness, it seems imperative to introduce the word "economic" in the places suggested in the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

Am I right in thinking that the wrong line is given in the noble Lord's first amendment?</p>

<p><a name="10112924000009"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10112924000084"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> It is in the charter, which is referred to in Clause 1, and I shall attempt to find it for the noble Lord. I have a fresh copy here rather than my marked-up copy. Paragraph 3.1 of the draft charter states that an objective is to "promote intergenerational fairness".</p>

<p><a name="10112924000010"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10112924000085"></a>Lord Peston:</b> My Lords, I shall speak specifically to the amendment in the name of my noble friend and myself, but what I say will also be very relevant to the other three amendments in the group.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000011"></a>Overwhelmingly, economists-I certainly include myself here-regard budget responsibility, or more generally financial soundness, as desirable, but within serious economics that desirability would be a means and not an end in itself. The end that one would have in mind in asking, "Why financial soundness?", or, "Why financial responsibility?", is the behaviour of the real economy. I know nothing in economics that tells anybody anything other than that the behaviour of the real economy is what we should be concentrating on. That is the specific purpose of my noble friend's amendment and it is quite specifically the purpose of Amendment 2.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000012"></a>Noble Lords whose memories go back a long way will realise that the amendment in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Barnett is simply an echo or, perhaps more than that, more or less a restatement of Section 11 of the Bank of England Act 1998, which set up the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. Essentially, it is derived from the very famous subject of that section. We wish precisely that to appear in this Bill. Indeed, it would be absolutely absurd for the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England to take account of Her Majesty's Government's economic policy for growth and employment-the real economy-and for the OBR not to do so. It is difficult to think that anyone could rationally have talked themselves into that position and I cannot believe that that is the position that the Government want.</p>

The Treasury's objectives for fiscal policy are to,</p>
<ul><a name="10112924000072"></a>"ensure sustainable public finances that support confidence in the economy",</ul>
<p><a name="10112924000064"></a>which is fine, and,</p>
<ul><a name="10112924000073"></a>"promote intergenerational fairness, and ensure the effectiveness of wider Government policy".</ul>
<p><a name="10112924000065"></a>Can the Minister tell me why we need the word "intergenerational"? It seems that one of the basic objectives of fiscal policy is to promote fairness and, of course, our coalition agreement holds fairness very high. Why do we need the word "intergenerational" here? As it is a draft charter, perhaps I may ask that the word be taken out from the final version.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000014"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10112924000087"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Eatwell. I think that I need do no more than cite our debate a few minutes ago in the Chamber when the Minister repeated the Statement on the OBR made earlier today in the other place by the right honourable Chancellor of the Exchequer. The central emphasis of that Statement was the economy. It would seem therefore that the Government intend to use the OBR and the charter in support of it to give confidence to their economic projections. I therefore suggest to the Minister that no harm would be done, and considerably greater precision would be achieved, if the words proposed by my noble friend were inserted in Clause 1.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000015"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10112924000088"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> My Lords, am I wrong in thinking that the amendment refers to line 6 and not line 5 of the Bill? Be that as it may, no doubt we can sort it out if it is wrong. I have great sympathy with the view put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. We shall see what response we get from the Government. Perhaps we may also have from the Government a little clarity with regard to the charter for budget responsibility, since it is described as a draft. Are we to understand that the Government will amend it in line with the comments made by this Committee or will we be able to amend it at some later stage more formally?</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000016"></a>An interesting point was made about "intergenerational fairness". I understand that we must be concerned with fairness generally, but we should realise also that the sudden introduction of this expression reflects a considerable change of view in the Treasury from previous years. It is of course possible for us to consume in this generation and pass on a lesser inheritance to future generations. However, if we are to appraise intergenerational fairness, we need not simply a government balance sheet, on which we have made a little progress, but a national balance sheet, which successive Governments have hitherto failed to provide. If the relevant paragraph is to have any credibility, we need further data. It would be helpful if the OBR could take a first shot at a national balance sheet. The argument that we should widen the charter a little from relating merely to implementation of fiscal policy seems reasonable, but I look forward with interest to hearing what my noble friend the Minister has to say.</p>

As he said, a request from the Opposition that Grand Committee should begin after the Statement in the Chamber to allow them to prepare a response was agreed to through the usual channels. I apologise if not all noble Lords were aware of the change of plan. I think that the Chief Whip announced it to the whole House following Oral Questions, but perhaps not everybody was there.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000018"></a>Perhaps I should go back to the Government's overall approach to the charter as background to Amendments 1 to 4, because they all touch on the addition of economic objectives.</p>

There is no specific amendment at this point about it. I want to talk about the charter, but I do not want to be forced to do it now just because it has been mentioned. Apart from the fact that the economics of intergenerational fairness, as my noble friend will know as well as I do, are so complex that I doubt that we would make much progress with the matter here, I am a little disturbed that we are suddenly going off in a direction that does not relate to the three amendments before us.</p>

I do not think that it will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It will be placed before Parliament but will not be subject to scrutiny. I was therefore taking advantage of the Committee because, as the draft charter has been published, we have the opportunity to discuss it.</p>

We are talking about the charter, which we have produced in draft to aid scrutiny of the Bill. I hope that people will think that that is helpful. There were, quite rightly, demands to see it, which is why we produced it a week ahead of the Committee stage. It will be formally laid in another place following Royal Assent to the Bill, so it necessarily remains in draft until that point. We will listen carefully and, if there are issues that touch on the charter that could in our judgment improve the drafting, we will take them on board.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000024"></a>The relevance of the charter is how it fits with the architecture relating to the responsibilities of the OBR. We also have to remember that certain things in the  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>charter do not directly relate to the fiscal mandate but are background information to it. I take the point that we should not get too far into discussions of irrelevant things, but intergenerational fairness is part of the fiscal objective that is in there as background information to the fiscal mandate, which comes in the subsequent paragraphs and links directly to the responsibilities of the Office for Budget Responsibility. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, is correct that intergenerational fairness can take on different definitions, but here we are using the term in a fiscal context to mean that future generations should not be burdened by deficits or the cost of servicing debts accumulated to pay for consumption by current or previous generations.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000025"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="10112924000094"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> That was the point that I was trying to make in a speech that I made in the House the other day. If there is a deficit and you are paying interest on that deficit, it sounds like a burden, but you are paying it to the people who lent you the money and they are predominantly other British citizens, so all that you are doing is transferring part of national product from one lot of British citizens-the taxpayers-to another lot of British citizens, the lenders. You are not actually creating an intergenerational transfer. An intergenerational transfer can be made, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pointed out quite accurately, by changing the volume of investment in any one year, which changes the growth rate of the economy and affects future income per head. A fiscal measure alone is not an intergenerational transfer.</p>

I am not sure what difference it makes to the analysis but, for better or worse, it is not the case that substantially all of the debt-he did not use that term-is held by UK citizens or bodies. The burden of debt that we have is well spread among international holders as well.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000027"></a>We should not get too far side-tracked. Intergenerational fairness is an important point, but the objectives for fiscal policy are, as I say, the background in the charter. People can see the context in which the critical elements of the Treasury mandate are set out in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the draft charter. Those are the two elements that bite particularly on the mandate of the OBR. The full objectives for fiscal policy include supporting and improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, which relates to the independent operations of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. We must remember how the architecture fits together.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000028"></a>Let me say a bit more about the background to the charter. Its purpose is to improve the transparency of the fiscal policy framework and, within that, to include the guidance on the role of the OBR within the broader framework. The charter is concerned with fiscal policy and includes the Treasury mandate for fiscal policy. It was important to have that document for people to see ahead of this discussion. The fiscal policy framework is part of the Government's overall approach to economic policy. Indeed, given the fiscal situation that the Government inherited, the coalition made it clear on its formation that reducing the budget

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000029"></a>The noble Lord's first amendment would require that the charter be expanded to relate to overall economic policy. Amendments 2 and 3 concern the addition of economic policy objectives, which means that we need to be clear about them. They are set out in the paper <I>The </I><I>Path to Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth</I>, which was published today. To achieve the objective of delivering growth that is consistent with values of freedom, fairness and responsibility and to improve the well-being of the British people, the Government must employ all their macroeconomic and microeconomic policy tools and frameworks. I mentioned that monetary policy is operated by the independent Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. That provides one set of tools that play a role in meeting the Government's economic policy objectives.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000030"></a>It may be helpful to remind the Committee that the Bank of England Act 1998 provides:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112924000070"></a>"In relation to monetary policy, the objectives of the Bank of England shall be ... to maintain price stability, and ... subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment".</p>

<p><a name="10112924000031"></a>I know that comments have been made about that, but it is probably not right this afternoon to go into the question of how all this works. The point is that the Bank of England Act does not set out the Government's economic policy objectives. That is not what we are trying to inject-nor should we-into the legislation that governs the operation of the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000032"></a>Financial stability policies are similarly crucial to delivering the overall economic policy objective. The Government have taken steps to reform the financial stability framework, providing the Bank of England with control of macroprudential regulation and oversight of microprudential regulation. Also, microeconomic policies create the conditions for growth and they, too, are essential. Fiscal policy represents another crucial set of tools that the Government use to achieve the overall policy objectives. The charter is the place where, for the first time, we have a transparent exposition of the framework. However, the charter is not itself the framework. It replaces the code for fiscal stability, which was part of the previous fiscal framework. Replacing that code was recommended by the Treasury Select Committee. The code did not contain economic objectives. Therefore, the charter remains a document relating to fiscal policy and should not be expanded to contain overall economic objectives.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000033"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="10112924000096"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Surely the "therefore" does not follow. Simply because the code did not include economic policy, it is wrong to say that therefore the charter should not. There is an opportunity, with the OBR and the charter, fundamentally to change the architecture with which we review and analyse the progress and success of the UK economy. I for one have warmly welcomed that from the opposition Benches, but the insertion of the word "therefore" in that sentence is simply illogical and misses the point of achieving the full potential that the OBR can offer.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000034"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="10112924000097"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, we could add an awful lot of not directly relevant things into the charter and make a document of biblical proportions that discusses all sorts of things. The charter, unlike the previous Government's code, explicitly sets out the Government's fiscal policy objectives, so we have moved on. However, there is no point in moving on to all sorts of things that do not need to be in there, which is what the noble Lord, Lord Myners, suggests. Yes, we have moved on. The charter explicitly includes the Government's means to achieve the fiscal objectives and the fiscal mandate. The coalition's programme for government made it clear that accelerating the reduction of the deficit to ensure recovery was the greatest challenge. That all links through to the policy actions that we have taken. Through the creation of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, credibility has been restored to the forecasts on which fiscal policy is based. I think that it is that that we all broadly welcomed at Second Reading and we must not lose sight of ensuring that the linkage between the Bill and the charter is focused on that single, critical objective.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000035"></a>The charter is a fiscal policy document, which helps to deliver the Government's economic policy. To deliver the economic policy objective, the Government employ a wide range of macroeconomic and microeconomic policy tools and frameworks and, for those reasons, I believe that the amendments are not appropriate. The charter is not the Government's economic policy framework but a document to underpin the work of the OBR, and that is all that it is proper to be. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will withdraw the amendment and not press Amendments 2 and 3.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000036"></a>Amendment 4 is similar in nature to the other three amendments in that it concerns the fiscal mandate, which is the means for achieving the fiscal objectives. It is the Government's quantified and specific target or fiscal rule, which will help to steer fiscal policy over the medium term. In setting a specific target, the mandate steers policy towards achieving the more general and strategic objectives that the Government have set for fiscal policy. The amendment suggests that the fiscal mandate is the key means of achieving the Government's economic objectives. That is not the case. The ambitious and appropriate fiscal mandate that the Chancellor has set is crucial to delivering our fiscal objectives as a Government, but a much wider suite of economic policy, as I have explained, contributes to the Government's economic objectives.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000037"></a>As I mentioned, the monetary policy framework, financial stability policy and microeconomic policy all contribute to the Government's economic objectives. It is correct that the Government create an economic policy environment where all policy frameworks and tools contribute to their economic policy objective, yet the fiscal mandate should remain a fiscal target in a statutory fiscal charter and we should not stray from that.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000038"></a>There are a couple of other points that it is perhaps worth touching on before I conclude. On sustainability, the OBR will bring forward a sustainability analysis next summer, which will include,</p>
<ul><a name="10112924000074"></a>"long-term projections for the public finances and an assessment of the public sector balance sheet".</ul>

<p><a name="10112924000066"></a>My noble friend Lord Higgins raised a question on that. It is referred to in paragraph 4.15 of the charter, so sustainability and the question of a balance sheet are absolutely in the work programme. Having explained the whole context for the charter within the overall fiscal framework, I hope that noble Lords will see fit not to press the amendments.</p>

Why not any other sort of fairness? The document says that these are:</p>

I thought that I had explained that a lot of things could be set out in a full description of the policy frameworks but that the objective is to have a short encapsulation of fiscal policy objectives as a background to the specific mandate for fiscal policy. As I also said, this is of course a draft charter. I am listening to that and other comments that are being made on the charter. I absolutely confirm that. I fully understand that there are other aspects of fairness; indeed, I read out another formulation of the coalition policy approach to broader economic policy-making, so I am absolutely listening to my noble friend's point. Fairness, without any specific reference to "intergenerational" or any other kind, is indeed central to the economic policy objectives of the coalition Government.</p>

I have said that, if the Minister cannot explain why intergenerational is the one bit of fairness that is picked out, why not leave out "intergenerational" and just say "fairness"?

First, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. His reference in the amendment to the lines in the Bill is correct. I was working on the original version of the Bill, which the Treasury has subsequently corrected. I just hope that the Public Bill Office has sorted out all my numbering; otherwise, I will have a lot of work ahead of me.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000045"></a>We should be extremely grateful to the Minister for providing the draft charter; otherwise, we would be relying purely on what is in the Bill, which leaves a large number of questions unanswered. Perhaps I may pursue the point raised by the Minister with regard to the fiscal mandate. There is no initial capital letter in "mandate" in the draft charter, which perhaps there should be. It states that the mandate is,</p>
<ul><a name="10112924000075"></a>"a forward-looking target to achieve cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling, five-year forecast period".</ul>
<p><a name="10112924000067"></a>That is an extremely important statement. My problem is that there are shades of Gordon Brown, rather like Banquo's ghost, in the reference to "cyclically-adjusted", because Gordon Brown was a master at changing the dates of when the cycle began. If the mandate is to mean anything at all, we need to know when the Government think that the cycle began. If my noble friend cannot answer now, perhaps he might come back to it later.</p>

<p><a name="10112924000046"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="10112924000103"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, at the risk of repeating myself, the Government's broader economic policy objective is clear and includes the achievement of strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries. That is consistent with values of broad freedom, fairness and responsibility. That is absolutely clear, I hope, as regards our broader economic policy objectives. However, as I have tried to explain, what we are talking about is the narrower context for the fiscal policy mandate. I am not personally very keen on too many capitalised terms, but I hear my noble friend's plea for an initial capital for "mandate"-it is certainly a critically important part of the construct. I will take away the thought.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000047"></a>This is the first time that these fiscal policy objectives have been tabled. We are not debating the charter in the way that we are debating the Bill, because the charter is not part of the Bill itself. It is not a question of debating the precise words, therefore, but I take the point. There are many things within the broader definition of fairness that do not impinge directly and narrowly on the conduct of fiscal policy. Therefore, I am not sure that it would be right to talk about fairness in its full richness here, but I have certainly listened carefully.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000048"></a>As to the question of cyclical adjustment, the absolutely critical point is that cyclical adjustment is now done by the independent OBR; it is not done by Ministers, who could and did rewrite, on a regular basis, the start and end points of cycles. That is important and I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to it.</p>

We were putting serious amendments, which it seems from all that the Minister said there is no good reason for rejecting. I can see nothing in the amendments that should cause the Government any problem.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000052"></a>Our amendment relates to the Bank of England Act, which the Government have accepted and are not seeking to amend, whatever they eventually put in the charter. The Minister was not with us when we debated these matters at length. The three words "subject to that" not just implied but provided a clear remit to the Monetary Policy Committee. I am not sure that it always carried out that remit very well or very carefully, or even, as the current governor has recently been saying, that the Monetary Policy Committee was allowed to discuss these things-a report of something that he said implied that he did not want the Monetary Policy Committee to discuss them.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000053"></a>All we are saying, and all my noble friend Lord Eatwell is saying, is that these words should be inserted. I do not recall either of my noble friends taking umbrage at any of the policies that the Government are proposing. That is not the purpose of Committee stage; its purpose is to have a serious discussion about whether an amendment should be accepted. I had hoped that the Minister would look at this first group of amendments more seriously, unlike with his Answers in the Chamber or to our Written Questions, which he seems not to take very seriously. On this occasion, at the start of the Committee stage, I had hoped that he would take it seriously before asking us to withdraw an amendment that has been put down very seriously without any party-political talk. He has not given me any good reason to withdraw it.</p>

He seems to be saying that we cannot have the words relating to economic policy because we want this to relate to fiscal policy only. If we step back, it seems to me that the economic policy of the Government ought to be as capable as the fiscal policy of being subjected to the transparency objectives that the Government have set out. Indeed, one of the things that the Government are to be genuinely lauded on is their approach to transparency, not only in relation to the Office for Budget Responsibility but also, for example, in relation to the publication of expenditure amounts over £25,000.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10112924000055"></a>Transparency has been one of the watchwords of our Government, but we come to the Bill and, for some reason, we are saying that the Office for Budget Responsibility will be required to look at our fiscal policy mandate only, not at our economic policy objectives. It seems to me that there is a transparency deficit if we are saying that we have to exclude economic policy, as it seems directly related to what the OBR will be doing. The only reason that my noble friend has given is that the Government have decided not to include it. Like other noble Lords, I am struggling for the rationale for excluding the Government's economic policy.</p>

I have no intention of withdrawing my amendments, but I am not going to divide on them. Rather like the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I want to hear the Minister give some reasoned answers including that he would like to think about it a bit more. He does not have to agree with us, but I thought that the whole point of meeting in Grand Committee was to behave non-politically, if I may say so, and co-operatively to clarify the Bill in order to make progress when we go back into the Chamber, when, no doubt, we will divide the House. I am beginning to get very irritated with the repetition of "withdraw the amendment" because I do not think that we are here for that purpose. We may withdraw it formally, but that is not the point.</p>

The purpose of this session is for the Minister to listen in a considered way to points made from the coalition Benches and the opposition Benches and to do us the courtesy of giving us a fair and reasoned explanation. The Minister has not done that. In fact, he has fallen back into the trap of the way in which he handles Written Questions, which is, on the whole, by completely ignoring the Question in the Answer that he gives. I plead that he seeks to answer the questions that are reflected in the amendments and, in particular, the observation from the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that intergenerational is a specified fairness as opposed to a general commitment to fairness that I understood the coalition to support.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000002"></a>To go back to the point of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Eatwell, fiscal policy and economic policy are inextricably linked and the Minister has given us no good reason why the two should be treated entirely separately so far as the charter is concerned. My anxiety is that, unless the Minister provides us with better explanations on these points, the Committee stage will be wasted, because all these amendments will be repeated when the Bill returns to the House. The Minister is failing to make appropriate use of the opportunity that Grand Committee provides for such matters.</p>

It is not that these employment forecasts were not done before; it is just that the previous Government chose not to share them with the British public and the economic commentators. The 150-page document that has been put out today is the best indication that the OBR is not going to hold back on analysing and laying out the full background as it considers appropriate under the minimum forecast requirements set out in paragraph 4.10 of the charter. I suggest that we can take confidence from the fact that there is nothing that the OBR feels inhibited about in doing whatever is necessary to underpin the conclusions that it needs to come to on the fiscal mandate and in laying out the full forecast.</p>

I take great comfort from what he says and I fully agree about the failures of the previous Government to disclose fully a wide range of economic forecasts. I cannot be more supportive of the OBR's broad intention in this and in many other respects. However, there is a provision in the Bill under which the Government can give the OBR guidance, and that guidance stands above all others, including the point that the OBR should perform its duty objectively, transparently and impartially. Therefore, can the Minister confirm that the Government will not be using the guidance process in any way to restrict the OBR's ability to comment on general economic matters? If the Minister could give us that assurance, it would give me considerable encouragement.</p>

I do not believe that anything in the Bill restricts the OBR's ability, within its mandate, to lay out whatever it considers appropriate. Indeed, I do not think that anything in the guidance will dictate the methods of analysis that the OBR undertakes. The guidance absolutely cannot include provisions on that. The charter seeks to explain what transparency means. Perhaps it is appropriate to highlight paragraph 4.8 at the top of page 12 of the charter, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000110"></a>"Transparently means that the OBR is to act openly, setting out with clarity the assumptions and judgements that underpin its work. It should proactively seek to make available its analysis. It should publish reports according to a regular and predictable process".</p>

He talked about not restricting the OBR's ability to comment on general economic matters. We are trying to create an instrument of fiscal policy, not a council of economic advisers that can comment on issues, such as whether the economy is competitive, whether we have the right set of industry instruments or whether the policies are correct for the flexibility of the labour market. The OBR can forecast the effects of the policies as they stand. There are references to the Government providing the OBR with as much information as possible to enable it to make those forecasts, but it is not the OBR's role to become a general commentator, as happens in some other countries, on all aspects of economic policy generally. Some of the amendments seem to be taking us towards that goal.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000009"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="10112935000142"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, for pointing that out. I do not accept the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. Yes, it is correct that, as exemplified by what we have seen today, the OBR indeed has the freedom to do what Members of this Committee are asking for, but that is not what these amendments are essentially about, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out. Clause 1 is not about the Office for Budget Responsibility doing things; it is about the Treasury producing a document to be known as the charter for budget responsibility. We could require the Treasury to produce all sorts of documents laying out economic policy and a huge number of other things, but the point of the clause is for the Treasury to prepare a document, the purpose of which is to set the background against which the OBR does its work. I have obviously failed to explain it, but the very distinguished former Permanent Secretary has come to my aid to point out that the Bill will set up an office focusing on fiscal policy. That is why the charter relates to fiscal policy. We do not want to widen it out, as the noble Lord said, to a document that sets a background for this office to go into all sorts of wider economic commentary. That point, as my noble friend reminded us, was made by the Treasury Select Committee.</p>

Clearly, in the other place, as repeated in our House, the report of the OBR was given by the Minister as an economic commentary. In the Minister's response to questions, he used the OBR to validate the correctness of the Government's economic strategy. The noble Lord said earlier that we cannot have it one way and then the other. I suggest that he and the Government cannot either. I hope that he will now answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.</p>

I was unable to watch the whole of the Q&amp;A session and do not know how long it went on, but it was wide-ranging. I believe that the document was seen on embargo terms by journalists ahead of the presentation so that they could ask informed questions of the OBR directly afterwards. Before somebody else challenges me on this, I should say that the OBR has pointed out that it will not always be able to present a document first if it is opining on new policy announcements. There will always be an opportunity to question the OBR directly on its forecasts, but that will be one part of the supporting architecture alongside a variety of other measures of performance, as well as new policy developments related to that, which a Chancellor will always at any time be responsible for. Of course, Chancellors must represent the OBR's work correctly, but it is entirely appropriate and necessary for it to refer to that work in the broader policy context, just as I have explained that the charter and the Bill relate to only one-albeit critical-element of the Government's overall economic policy-making framework.</p>

I am nervous of getting another lecture of the formalities of how we operate in Grand Committee. I had understood that we went through the formality of my doing the proposers of amendments the courtesy of formally asking them whether they will withdraw. If that is not the process, somebody will no doubt advise me. While the amendment has led to some interesting observations about the precise wording of the fiscal policy mandate and other aspects of the charter, in relation to the basic question of whether the Bill-and, by implication, the OBR's work-should be opened up to a much wider commentary on the Government's wider economic policy, I think absolutely not.</p>

I am someone who has become a great advocate of Grand Committees as a way in which to deal with almost all our Bills, because I interpreted these Committees as a place where there could be a meeting of minds and where the Minister thought about things rather than writing down, as my noble friend Lord Myners said, "Reject, reject, reject". If that is really what we are going to get, I do not know whether I personally will bother to waste my time with him. I regard it as outrageous if we are going to get rejection after rejection on the next amendment and the one after it. If that is going to be his style, because essentially that is what he has been told to do, why are we here?</p>

Yes, there may be a run of amendments that I and the Government see little merit in but, if I see merit in them, I shall respond accordingly. There does not seem any point in my saying in a wishy-washy way that it is all rather splendid and that I shall go away and think about it when I think that the amendments do not have merit.</p>

He knows how he is going to treat them because the documentation is sitting behind him at this very minute. If that is what is going to happen, except on trivial amendments, I repeat my question: why are we here? We expect the Government to say, as a minimum, on some of the substantive amendments, "The arguments have been good and we must go away and think about them". If we are not going to get that on anything substantive, I repeat: why are we here?</p>

If I feel, having heard the arguments, that I should take the amendments away or that I should accept them, I will say that. I will try to tell noble Lords what I believe, but I do not believe that these amendments have any merit. If there are amendments that I believe have merit, I will endeavour to make that abundantly clear.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000020"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="10112935000153"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, I realise that this is the first time that the Minister has had to face a Grand Committee and perhaps he will be better prepared next time we meet. However, as to these amendments, I have just four points to make in response to our debate.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000021"></a>The first is purely technical, in that the Bill as drafted is inconsistent. Clause 6(1)(a) states that the charter for budget responsibility may include guidance about the,</p>
<ul><a name="10112935000123"></a>"assessment or analysis required to be prepared under subsection (3) or (4) of",</ul>
<p><a name="10112935000022"></a>Clause 4. However, subsection (3) of that clause refers to "fiscal and economic forecasts". The charter is therefore required by Clause 6 to provide guidance on economic forecasts. The Bill is inconsistent if "economic" is not included in Clause 1. It is not at all clear what the Government really intend to do. It is only clarity that I seek here. As noble Lords have said, there is no great economic or political point behind all this. Actually, there is a good economic point, but there is no great political point. The amendment aims purely at making the Bill consistent.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000023"></a>My second point is that, in its consideration of fiscal policy, the OBR has to have some guidance as to the Government's overall economic policy. Otherwise, it is not possible for the OBR to make a coherent assessment. If you do not believe me, just look at this document, the OBR's <I>Economic and Fiscal Outlook</I>, which is exactly that. It is a very fine document, if I may say so. For example, the delayed rebalancing  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scenario and the weakening demand scenario are discussed in the document. Why is that? It is because the OBR is linking different economic performance to the consequences for fiscal performance. That is exactly what this document does.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000024"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, that we are not trying to set out some broad economic assessment committee, but, as another gloomy Cambridge economist, he should recognise that there is a clear interrelationship between economic and fiscal policy. The intention of these amendments was simply to capture that relationship. If this could be done in a better way and could make the Bill consistent, I would be very happy. If the Minister says, "We'll think about this and see if we can achieve that in a better way", so that this document does not trespass beyond the mandate given by the Bill to the OBR, I would be very happy.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000025"></a>I turn to Amendment 4. The Minister asked why the fiscal mandate should require an economic dimension. Here, there is a bit of economics involved, because there is a view among some economists that the economy has a normal rate of activity and a normal rate of employment to which it persistently returns having moved away from them because of some economic shock. It is clear that that is not the view of the economists who wrote this document, otherwise they would not have written such scenarios. It recalls the remark of the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Professor Robert Solow, that this view of policy was a vision in a dream. The fiscal mandate requires some economic dimension, because you could have different results depending on the nature of your economic policy-they are interlinked. That is all that I am trying to capture in my amendments-nothing more and nothing less.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000026"></a>I say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that I do not think that the drafters of the charter know what "intergenerational fairness" means or what the economics of intergenerational transfers consist of. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, got it exactly right: it is about changing the rate of investment in the economy. It has nothing to do with fiscal policy as such and it should not be in the charter. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that the word "intergenerational" be removed would provide some validity to a sentence that currently has none.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000027"></a>I am afraid that I must reflect the general opinion around the Grand Committee that these points have not been answered; indeed, I am not clear that they have been understood. Accordingly, I shall need to return to them on Report, by which time some more careful thinking about them will hopefully have been done.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000028"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="10112935000154"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> We have gone into territory in this discussion that is well beyond the consistency of the Bill. Consistency is important and we of course want to get it right. I see no difficulty in there being an economic forecast, as provided for by Clause 4(3)(a), without there being a government statement in the charter on broader economic policy. I accept that there is a critical need for the OBR to make an economic forecast to underpin its assessment of the fiscal mandate, but I am still struggling to grasp the point on consistency.</p>

Clause 6(1)(a) requires the charter for budget responsibility<I></I>to give guidance on how to pair subsections (3) or (4) of Clause 4. Subsection (3)(a) of that clause refers to "fiscal and economic". The charter must therefore include guidance on "economic". At the moment, it does not.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000030"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="10112935000156"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> We are possibly getting this a little confused. Of course, in order to make an economic forecast, it may be appropriate for the charter to give, as it does in paragraph 4.10, guidance on economic forecasts, but that is very different from setting out in the charter the Government's broad economic policy objectives. It is unnecessary, distracting and inappropriate for the charter to go into the broad economic policy objectives of the Government. However, I quite see that it is appropriate for the charter to go into questions that touch on economic forecasting. Indeed, it already does that, which is completely compatible with the terms of the Bill.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000031"></a>I will of course look again if it is a narrow consistency point. However, in trying to make a consistency point on what does not, from my reading of the Bill, need to be tidied up, the amendment opens up a much bigger swathe of territory, as I am sure the noble Lord is well aware, by including in Clause 1 broad questions of economic policy objectives. Yes, it is appropriate to talk about economic forecasting guidance in the charter-indeed, it is there-but its being there is much more specific and appropriate than opening up the charter to economic policy which, I would suggest, is simply not relevant. We will have a look again at the consistency question. My reading of it is that we do not have an issue there, but I will look at it again.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000032"></a>On the intergenerational question, I made the point that I am listening to what people say. I do not pretend for one minute to be an expert on the different interpretations and consequences of intergenerational fairness, but I will take back the suggestions that we have had on that from both sides of the Committee. Again, that is not something which, if there was any merit in changing the charter's wording, needs any amendment to Clause 1 of the sort that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000034"></a>Those duties under Clause 4 include economic forecasts. I repeat that I have no intention of trying to create some general economic assessment. My main point is: economic and fiscal policy are intimately and necessarily linked. I was trying to capture that linkage in my amendment. I am quite willing to believe that my amendments do not capture it successfully, but it is capturing that point that I am looking for. I hope that, when we return to this on Report, that point will be appreciated and that the Government will be able to reply in some positive way about their response to this particular argument. In the mean time, I formally beg leave to withdraw Amendment 1.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000113"></a>"The Charter (or the modified Charter) does not come into force until it has been approved by a resolution of the House of Commons",</p>

<p><a name="10112935000037"></a>and my amendment adds "and the House of Lords". The variations on that suggest the Economic Affairs Committee of your Lordships' House and so on. It would seem appropriate that the charter should be considered by a resolution in each House and, if we have any serious problem at that stage, we ought to be able to express a view one way or another. It is a somewhat draconian measure because it would presumably mean that the charter was or was not accepted, but over the years, and despite the row we had on the Floor of the House this afternoon, there increasingly seems to be a tendency for your Lordships' House to be more involved in affairs involving money. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment.</p>

As we debated this afternoon on the Floor of the House, this is not a money Bill. I do not think the Speaker in any way thought about certifying it as a money Bill. Every Bill costs a few bob, but in no way could this be described as a money Bill. I assume that the Minister is going to say that he will accept the amendments. It is quite straightforward: there is no reason whatever why the House of Lords and its Economic Affairs Committee should not be

When I was on the Economic Affairs Committee and the Select Committee on the Monetary Policy Committee, my noble friend Lord Peston was in the chair, and we had the Governor of the Bank of England, the Chancellor and almost everybody else there. I can think of no good reason for the Minister having the word "resist". I hope he will not use it because there is no reason to refuse these amendments. I hope he will support them.</p>

There can be no issue of propriety about whether the House of Lords should have a role here. This raises a broader question about the coalition's view of the role of the House of Lords on financial and economic matters. The previous Government and the former Prime Minister were almost implacably opposed to this House having anything to do with economic affairs, which I thought was a pity because there is clearly expertise here. Last week, we discussed ways in which the House of Lords might play a part in tax policy-making. That would be very sensible as well and it would form part of the piece, along with these amendments, under which the House of Lords would have an enhanced role.</p>

If it were widened to include economic policy, which most of us here, with the exception of my noble friend, favour, then it would be entirely logical for it to be widened to include the House of Lords, but I believe that, as currently drafted, it is entirely logical to confine it to the other place.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000041"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="10112935000165"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> I shall take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I think there is a distinction between the substance-fiscal policy-which it is well accepted is a privilege matter for the House of Commons, and what we are talking about-the governance structure of policy-which is, in a sense, a quasi-constitutional issue. We are talking about the charter, not fiscal policy. This is an area in which the House of Lords has some expertise. Therefore, I conclude exactly the opposite-that the charter should be rightly within the purview of the House of Lords, even when the fiscal policy is not.</p>

Perhaps I may share my own experience with the Committee. When I became a Minister, I was told that of course there would be some duties in the House of Lords but that I should not worry about that. In fact, every effort would be made to reduce those duties to an absolute minimum. I came to the conclusion that most people in the other place had a very poor appreciation of what happens in the House of Lords and of the excellent work that this

That is particularly pronounced in the Treasury. When I was in the Treasury, I found that there was almost no institutional knowledge there about the processes of the House of Lords. The noble Lord has succeeded me as a Peer based in the Treasury, but you then have to go back 25 years to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, to find the last Member of the House of Lords who was a Treasury Minister, and another 10 years before you come to Lord Cockfield, who was a GOAT in his own day, although not so described. The Treasury starts with a disposition that matters to do with the economy and finance should not detain the House of Lords. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is correct in ensuring that the House of Lords is respected in the contribution that it can make by virtue of the breadth of experience represented on the Benches. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000043"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew62"></a><a name="10112935000167"></a>Lord Barnett:</b> When I was Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I could not care at all what the House of Lords was doing about Finance Bills, because it could not amend them. The noble Lord is quite right. My noble friend Lord Davies was my PPS for much of that time, and he knows that one place we did not care about was the House of Lords, because it could not amend Bills.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000044"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew63"></a><a name="10112935000168"></a>Lord Peston:</b> My Lords, perhaps I could take us back into the history of some of this. When what became the Bank of England Act 1998 appeared before us as a Bill, it had exactly the same fault that this Bill has in referring to the House of Commons as the House that would look at the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. My noble friend Lord Barnett and I moved an amendment in a slightly different form from this one. It said, "delete House of Commons and insert Parliament", and it was accepted. I did not know it at the time but that happened over the dead body of my right honourable friend the former Prime Minister and Chancellor. However, that went in. At the same time, we set up the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee to look at the Finance Bills. As my noble friend Lord Barnett pointed out, we cannot amend Finance Bills, but the Clerk of the Parliaments wrote a definitive statement, which I hope the Minister has read, saying that there was nothing in Erskine May to prevent the House of Lords looking at Finance Bills. The House cannot amend them, so we set up the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee to look at them. The House of Lords can look at the substance of Finance Bills-it can look at any bit of them, according to the Clerk of the Parliaments. That is the definitive view. However, it can only draw attention to certain considerations; it cannot amend. So that is the history.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000045"></a>The amendment in this context would do exactly the same thing. It would enable the House of Lords, in various ways, to involve itself in scrutinising the Office for Budget Responsibility, as my noble friend Lord Myners pointed out, but we would have no powers to order it to do anything at all. That is essentially the position of the House of Lords in making a contribution.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>

When I got here, one of my noble friends said, "You were hardly here a day when you sold out, and you just love the place". That has been my position for 23 years. I take a certain offence from the fact that the Bill does not include the House of Lords.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, might be pleased to know that I had the pleasure of serving under the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for several years on the Economic Affairs Committee and sub-committee and he was as peppery then as he is now, so it is nothing personal. It was a worthwhile committee. You need only look round this Room to see the range of expertise and economic distinction of Members of this House. I remember that there was a former Chancellor of the Exchequer and very distinguished economists of all sorts. I endorse the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, and thank him for engaging more seriously with this House as a Treasury Minister than we have had in the past. That committee was excellent, and it could do nothing but add to the quality of debate and economic governance in this country to pass this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000048"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="10112935000170"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> I have a couple of comments to make on the amendments. With respect to the engagement of my noble friend Lord Myners in the House, that was increased by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, from the other side, who kept him working hard.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000049"></a>On the remarks with respect to the charter, there is a good point. The Economic Affairs Committee of your Lordships' House takes a long-run view on fiscal affairs, which is what you want to get into with this charter. It is about the whole philosophy that the Government have talked about. In the examination of the Finance Bill by the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs Committee, there is tremendous expertise considering technical aspects of fiscal policy. To quote another example of involvement by your Lordships' House, I had the privilege of serving on the pre-legislative committee on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which was a committee of both Houses. It enormously improved the Bill before it got to the legislative stage and saved a lot of time in the House.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000050"></a>With respect to the charter, my noble friends and the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, have hit on an absolutely central and valid point. On the amendment referring to appointments, it might be a little cumbersome unless we put the two committees together. What if the two committees disagreed? It would all become rather messy, so I am rather agnostic on that. The key amendment is Amendment 35. My noble friends have spotted an obvious oversight in the drafting of Schedule 1. Of course, the OBR should provide evidence to the relevant committees of both Houses. I am referring to evidence that is within the terms of its remit as defined in the Bill. If it is independent, it should be shown to be such by providing evidence in that way. We ought to have the word "reasonable" here so that reasonable requests for attendance can be made. After all, the OBR is rather small, and it cannot be attending things

Whether the drafting is appropriate, I am not sure, but it is an entirely sensible point that when necessary the OBR should appear before committees in your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and I at different stages in our lives were Treasury Ministers in different Administrations under different Prime Ministers. Both of us served for several years. Before that time, I had the privilege of serving as a Back-Bench Member on the Finance Bill when the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, was Chief Secretary. There is symmetry here with my first experience of the noble Lord as a tutor on the Finance Bill because he was extremely scathing about the first group of amendments that I tabled. My noble friend Lord Lawson of Blaby had to rescue me and explain that there was more to my amendments than the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, was suggesting. However, the reason why there is symmetry with this moment in the Grand Committee's affairs is that the second time I moved amendments, which was the very next group, the noble Lord accepted them with enthusiasm, which was extremely good for a young pupil. We have just experienced everyone being mildly upset with my noble friend the Minister, but it is just possible that everything will be set right by what he has to say.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000053"></a>Two of my noble friends on this Grand Committee, as Conservative Peers, have taken opposite views of these amendments. Obviously there are things to be said on either side. I am going to extend the Minister the courtesy of listening to him, not least because that also seems to be one of the purposes of Grand Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000054"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew67"></a><a name="10112935000172"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> Oh dear! Where do I start? I should say-because I genuinely mean it-that it is important to have full and appropriate scrutiny in your Lordships' House of what the OBR is about. However, we must be careful. I do not want to be too hidebound by some inappropriately narrow interpretation of propriety and convention, but I think that we need to be careful about the balance between achieving full scrutiny here and not crossing inappropriate lines. We need to remember that there are a lot of important provisions in the Bill that will enable scrutiny by Parliament as a whole, so the Budget Responsibility Committee will indeed be available for Select Committee scrutiny. Its forecasts and very full analysis, which we have discussed at some length, will be laid directly before both Houses. On funding, there will be separate reporting of the OBR's expenditure in the Treasury estimates presented to Parliament, and of course there have already been quite a number of Written Questions. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, does not always like the way that I reply to his Questions, but perhaps if he would cut them down from six to one a day, I could focus even more attention on providing him with a really good Answer. However, as he knows, Questions that he and other noble Lords send in which relate to the OBR's responsibilities always get passed on to the OBR.</p>

If the Minister is struggling to keep up with his work, I will obviously make an effort to lighten the burden on him. However, I hope that he makes a serious effort to answer Written Questions. There are some examples in <I>Hansard</I> today which are so far from the mark in terms of attempting to answer the Question that they treat the House with a disregard which is inappropriate.</p>

If the Treasury made a bit more effort to answer Questions honestly and fully the first time, we would not need to ask them two or three times. It is a bad problem.</p>

The number of Questions for Written Answer that the Treasury has had to deal with in the past six months has been significantly above the figure that previous Ministers in the Treasury-principally the noble Lord himself-have had to face. Nevertheless, our record on answering Questions on time has improved dramatically, and I am very happy to supply the noble Lord with the data. I am conscious that we are scheduled to go on for only another 35 minutes, so perhaps we should go back to the Bill. However, with regard to answering Treasury Questions, I am happy to discuss the relative performance of this Parliament compared with the previous one if it would interest the noble Lord, although I shall do so on another occasion.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000058"></a>We want plenty of scrutiny in this House. Clauses 1(4), 1(6), 2(3) and 8(2)(b) all confirm that the OBR's reports will be presented to the whole of Parliament, not just to another place. I will return specifically to the question of committee scrutiny, but it is important that the Economic Affairs Committee of your Lordships' House should have, and will have, responsibility for whatever it thinks appropriate in considering economic and fiscal issues, including those that relate to the OBR. However, I do not believe that any of the amendments in this group are necessary to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000059"></a>When it comes to the relatively narrow but important point on formal approval of the charter, perhaps this will not surprise noble Lords, but I very much lean towards the argument of my noble friend Lady Noakes, because, critically, the charter contains the fiscal mandate, which I believe should be properly considered in another place, rather than here.</p>

I am not for one minute challenging the ruling, but that is a different proposition from the specific proposition that this House should be responsible for voting on the adoption of the charter, which has within it a specific mandate that is in the province of another place. That does not cut across the absolute right that this House must have, whether in full session or in a committee, to consider fiscal matters, and I have drawn attention to four references in the Bill where that is made completely clear. That is different from the question of the approval of and voting on the charter, which contains the mandate. That would be straying into territory into which this House should not stray, as my noble friend Lady Noakes has said. The same principle held under the previous fiscal policy framework. I am not saying that just because something was held previously it should necessarily mean that it should always be right, but it is important in this context to remind ourselves that the code for fiscal stability, which the charter replaces, was approved and subject to amendment through a resolution in another place; and the fiscal targets set through the fiscal responsibility-</p>

One of the problems is that the action in subsection (7) could take place before the House of Lords has had a chance to comment on it. There is not even a right of consultation and no right even for noble Lords' views to be heard before the House of Lords votes. If the Minister wants to retain the ultimate right of decision, something may perhaps be done about the sequencing, whereby the decision does not take place until the Economic Affairs Committee or whoever has had a chance to consult on this matter. That would enshrine the right to involvement, but would not give the House of Lords a right to decide in areas where you do not think it should have that right.</p>

We are allowed to examine and report on finance Bills but we have no right to influence the outcome.

Clearly, whether it is comments from the EAC or the comments that we have already had today-we will no doubt get more as we consider this Bill-as any comments come in on the charter, we will listen. We are very willing to take them in any form. I am not sure whether there is a way to accommodate another formal sequencing of comments, but we are absolutely open to comments and the charter has already been out there in public for a week.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000066"></a>It is also worth mentioning that the Delegated Powers Committee of your Lordships' House has looked at all the delegated powers in the Bill, including the provisions for the charter to be approved in another place. It is perhaps worth reminding ourselves that that committee said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000114"></a>"There is a very full memorandum for the Committee from H.M. Treasury which covers all of the delegated legislative powers and also some other powers of an administrative character. There is nothing in the Bill to which the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the House".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000067"></a>That is an important and considered view from our guardians of delegated powers. I take the point from the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, that we should not lose any opportunity to get comments on the draft. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that we absolutely see the Economic Affairs Committee and the House itself continuing to take a broad interest and to play a part in holding the Government and the OBR to account on this framework but, on this precise point, we must be careful not to stray over the line of constitutional propriety in a way that was certainly enshrined in the previous fiscal arrangements.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000068"></a>I should say one or two things about Amendment 8. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, described it as "cumbersome". I was not going to use anything quite so direct but he goes to the heart of the point. Clearly, Parliament plays an important role in scrutinising the appointment of the chair of the OBR and other members of the BRC. I think that we have gone further, in that respect, than in any other appointment processes. However, whether it is because it is cumbersome or simply goes a step further than is necessary or appropriate, we believe that the Treasury Select Committee is the most appropriate means to exercise that scrutiny, given the nature of the body.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000069"></a>I do not want to labour the point, but we must remember that the chair and other members of the BRC may appear before the Economic Affairs Committee to discuss the work of the office. From a government perspective, I would welcome the scrutiny of the EAC, but I think it is right to preserve the role of the Treasury Select Committee on, specifically, the appointment.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000070"></a>This links with Amendment 35, the final amendment in this group, which requires that OBR members must appear before or provide evidence to the Treasury Select Committee or the Economic Affairs Committee of your Lordships' House when requested. To restate the point, I agree with the principle of the amendment, but my understanding is that the power to summon individuals to give evidence to parliamentary committees is already in the Standing Orders and that is the way that we customarily leave it. This amendment would place in statute arrangements relating essentially to

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000071"></a>This group of amendments helpfully draws attention to the important role of this House in scrutinising critical aspects right across the OBR's remit. That is important in the context of, particularly, the EAC's ongoing role in broader economic policy-making. There is nothing in the Bill that constrains that, but we should not stray over the line in the one rather narrow element that some of these amendments relate to. It is not necessary to enshrine in the Bill matters that are customarily dealt with through the Standing Orders. I hope that I have sufficiently answered noble Lords' concerns on these issues and explained how we think that the proper role of the House is very much enshrined and that the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

I shall dispose of Amendment 38 immediately as it is rather oddly grouped with the other amendments. It refers to leaving out "paragraph (c)". That part of the Bill says that the OBR must,</p>
<ul><a name="10112935000125"></a>"publish the report ... lay it before Parliament, and ... send a copy of it to the Treasury".</ul>
<p><a name="10112935000103"></a>I tabled the amendment as it seems rather absurd if the office has to publish and lay the report before Parliament that it should need to send a copy to the Treasury. We could make a substantial saving in public expenditure on postage by eliminating that and I hope that my noble friend will accept that amendment.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000076"></a>Amendments 7 and 21 take a diametrically opposed view to that expressed by the noble Lords opposite in Amendment 33. Amendment 7 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000117"></a>"The Treasury shall not make economic forecasts covering the same areas as those of the Office for Budget Responsibility".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000104"></a>There is a case for including that in the Bill because, otherwise, after going through all the expense of the OBR, we will find the Treasury still duplicating it unnecessarily. I hope that my noble friend can accept that amendment.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000077"></a>Amendment 21 is an important amendment dealing with the forecasts and suggests that we should insert,</p>
<ul><a name="10112935000126"></a>"which are agreed with the Bank of England; the agreed forecasts will then be used both by the Treasury and the Bank of England".</ul>
<p><a name="10112935000105"></a>If our economy is not to be managed in a totally schizophrenic manner between the fiscal and monetary side of things, it would be quite absurd if the two bodies will not use the same forecasts. Otherwise we are bound to end up with a situation where monetary policy goes one way and the forecast on which the decisions are based may be quite different from that of the Office for Budget Responsibility. That seems an eminently sensible suggestion. It is categorically contradicted by the amendment in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Barnett, which says that the,</p>
<ul><a name="10112935000127"></a>"Office must always act independently of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, especially in regard to its forecasts".</ul>
<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000078"></a>I do not think that the Bank of England can have one set of forecasts and the Treasury another without there being some risk that economic policy is in conflict between monetary and fiscal policy. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000079"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="10112935000186"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> My Lords, I speak almost in direct contradiction to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. The current draft of the fiscal framework says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000118"></a>"The Government intends to adopt the OBR's fiscal and economic forecasts as the official forecast of the Budget Report. The Government retains the right to disagree with the OBR's forecasts and, if this is the case, will explain why to Parliament. The Treasury will continue to maintain the necessary analytical and macroeconomic expertise to provide on-going advice to the Government".</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000080"></a>I would say that that is absolutely spot on and what the relationship should be. Treasury Ministers have the ultimate accountability and should, if they feel it essential, be able to state their view and then justify it in a very important area, which is different from monetary policy. They take fiscal policy decisions;  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they do not take monetary policy decisions. This is the correct formulation and I hope that it will be supported. The Treasury will, of course, need to maintain a separate apparatus. If the entire forecasting apparatus were transferred to the OBR it would be necessary for the Treasury, for all sorts of other purposes-if only to answer questions from Parliament-to retain some apparatus. Then you would get unnecessary duplication.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000081"></a>On the question of whether the Bank and the OBR should agree a common forecast, it is surprising that someone from the Conservative Party is suggesting a monopoly. I think that the element of competition is important and, if the two forecasts differ, we ought to know why. Parliament, the EAC and its equivalent committee, the Treasury Select Committee, should examine why the two bodies have different views, rather than try to suppress them and coerce them into some kind of lowest common denominator. Therefore, I am not attracted at all to this group of amendments and I think that paragraph 3.7 of the draft charter is exactly where we should be.</p>

In terms of the central forecast, it would be a bit like having a dog and barking yourself. Perhaps the Minister can give us an example of a circumstance in which the Government envisage they might invoke that right.</p>

In particular, the prohibition in Amendment 7 on the Treasury making economic forecasts does not appear realistic. I know that we are concerned that there will be a recreation of the functionality that has now been transferred from the Treasury to the OBR, but the plain fact is that the Treasury has to consider whether to accept the forecasts. It may wish to disagree and, if it cannot do its own forecasts, how is it going to deal with that position? This is a very difficult area but I do not think that it would be right to legislate in this way.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000084"></a>My noble friend's Amendment 38 made me look at Clause 8. This is a small point but I should be grateful for my noble friend's comments. He suggested that the OBR need not send a copy of its report to the Treasury. Can he explain how this quango lays a document before Parliament? Does it not normally go through a government department to Parliament? It was always my understanding that documents were laid via Ministers, although I may be wrong.</p>

Amendment 21 suggests that there should be a discussion between the Bank and the Treasury to agree the forecast. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, says that we want competition and so there may be two separate forecasts. That is fine but the two ought to be reconcilable, and in any event  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there should ultimately be a set of agreed forecasts which form the basis for the Government taking action. I do not think that you can have one set of policies on the monetary side being made on the basis of one forecast and fiscal decisions being made on the other. So far as concerns the point made by my noble friend Lady Noakes, it seems that the whole object of this exercise is to say that the Treasury shall not have its own forecasts and that the forecasts should be independent. However, I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000086"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew85"></a><a name="10112935000190"></a>Lord Barnett:</b> I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on Amendment 21 because I do not see why the Treasury and the Bank of England should necessarily agree. Perhaps I may make one or two points about the previous replies that we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon. He said that amendments are unnecessary because the powers are already in the Bill. Although they are unnecessary, equally one could say that accepting the amendments would do no harm to the Bill, as they would only be repeating what is in the Bill. He also made the case for reserving the power for the Commons-at least he has given us a reason for rejecting an amendment. I disagree with him. I reserve the right to consider the matter on Report because I see no reason why the House of Lords should not consider these matters.</p>

<p><a name="10112935000087"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew86"></a><a name="10112935000191"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> The amendments raise in different ways an important issue in relation to the draft charter. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, drew attention to paragraph 3.7, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000119"></a>"The Treasury will continue to maintain the necessary analytical and macroeconomic expertise to provide on-going advice to the Government".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000106"></a>That sounds perfectly sensible. However, it goes to the heart of the rather grey area of what OBR independence means that the same paragraph should declare:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000120"></a>"The Government intends to adopt the OBR's fiscal and economic forecasts as the official forecast for the Budget Report".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000107"></a>Indeed, according to the draft charter:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000121"></a>"The OBR's forecasts are essential inputs to the Government's ongoing policy-making".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000108"></a>And yet, the Government retain the right to disagree. I can see that the Government can maintain the right to disagree with anybody, especially with an independent body-which the OBR is supposed to be-but I do not then see how they can adopt the OBR's fiscal and economic forecasts as the official forecast for the Budget report. They cannot adopt something with which they disagree as the official forecast; it just does not work. They cannot have it both ways; it is nonsensical.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000088"></a>It is obvious that the OBR will need to work closely with staff at the Treasury and other government departments in developing costings. That is why we should expect consistency between the OBR's forecasts and those used by the Treasury-after all, they have worked together to bring them to fruition. They are the crucial decision variables. In his foreword to the forecast document that we discussed in the Chamber today, Robert Chote thanks government departments for providing the decision variables which have gone into it. The OBR is in essence a rather peculiar body. It  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not really a non-departmental public body; it is a Treasury non-departmental public body which plays a crucial role in the development of policy. As paragraph 3.7 of the charter precisely states, it is the "official forecast". I do not understand how the Government can disagree with the official forecast. They can disagree with the OBR, for example, when it takes a punt in describing some scenarios, as it does in the charter, but how can they disagree with the official forecast?</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000089"></a>I cannot see why there is a need to require consistency between forecasts put forward by the Treasury and those put forward by the Bank of England. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, referred to competition between forecasts. I would take a rather different view and say that to require consistency would endow forecasts with spurious precision, whereas there are number of judgments in forecasts which are worth discussing in the context of the formation of economic policy.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000090"></a>The underlying point is that the OBR is distanced from official policy-making to a degree that was not possible in the past. That is an achievement of which this Government should be proud. But to describe the OBR as "independent" is an exaggeration. It is useful for propaganda purposes, but it is not credible to grown-ups, because it has to be involved in policy-making. There is a degree of independent methodology but not really of judgment, which is a different dimension. The Minister has to answer the following question: how can there be an official forecast with which the Government then disagree?</p>

<p><a name="10112935000091"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="10112935000192"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> Let me start with the easy end of this. Some important points were raised, not least the crucial point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, for trying to save postage-we do look at every bit of possible wastage around government. However, on the point that my noble friend Lady Noakes raised, the construct here is that in Clause 8(2) the OBR is required to lay its reports before Parliament, and that means directly. So it is probably worth the price of a postage stamp or somebody pressing an electronic button, or whatever one does these days, to ensure that, given that this is an independent body, it does not forget to send a courier round to the Treasury as well. That is probably a failsafe that we should have in there.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000092"></a>On the nub of the questions around the linkage of the forecast to the Treasury and the linkage between the forecasts of the OBR and the MPC, the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, kindly drew our attention to paragraph 3.7 of the charter. That is the critical one. In the first sentence it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10112935000122"></a>"The Government intends to adopt the OBR's fiscal and economic forecasts as the official forecast for the Budget Report".</p>

<p><a name="10112935000109"></a>That is the Government's intention, but the charter continues by saying that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="10112935000128"></a>"retains the right to disagree with the OBR's forecasts".</ul>
<p><a name="10112935000093"></a><b><a name="101129-gc0001.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="10112935000193"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> Will the Minister clarify this for me? Is he saying that while the Government intend to accept the OBR's forecast, they may actually reject it? Is that what he is saying here?</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

It is absolutely the intention and the expectation that the Government will adopt the forecast in all but the most extreme circumstances. In answer to the challenge of my noble friend Lord Newby, it would be wrong to start thinking about hypothetical contexts. It is right, and it is the intention of the construct of the Bill and the charter, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, explained it-and I agree with him that this is the appropriate construct-that ultimately the Minister directly accountable to the electorate and Parliament should retain the discretion not to use the OBR's forecasts. That should be only a fall-back situation that needs to be legislated for. It is ultimately a decision that must be made by a Minister who is directly democratically accountable as part of the Government, as I hope we would agree, because it is so critical to underpinning economic policy. That does not change the fact that the OBR will be responsible for producing the official forecast or that the Government expect that there will be circumstances in which the Government disagree with the forecast. Nevertheless, it is entirely appropriate that that failsafe is allowed for and, in those circumstances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will have to make the nature of the disagreement absolutely clear to Parliament. It will be completely transparent and the Chancellor should answer that question. That is exactly what we intend to have, but that does not mean that we are taking the OBR's forecasts in any way lightly; it is a failsafe mechanism ensuring appropriate parliamentary and ministerial accountability.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000095"></a>There was one thing on which I may have misunderstood or misheard the noble Lord. He may have said in passing that he believed that the construct made it necessary for the OBR to be involved in policy-making. I see the noble Lord indicating that he did not say that. Good. Our construct means that the OBR absolutely is not involved. Just to be clear, it should not be involved in policy-making, and that is linked to why, at the end of the day, the Chancellor must have the right in extreme circumstances to disagree.</p>

In other words, those forecasts and estimates are part of the toolkit for making policy, but the OBR does not itself make policy decisions. That is what I meant to say.</p>

I should move on briefly to the question of whether it would be appropriate to align the forecasts of the OBR with those of the Monetary Policy Committee. Again, I am very much with the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, on this. It is worth mentioning what Robert Chote, the OBR chair, said on this subject. He made it clear during the hearings of the Treasury Select Committee that, as he sees it, the OBR and the Bank of England are independent bodies and each needs to make its own judgments for its own reasons. I completely agree, but he went on to say that he recognised that it would be valuable for the Bank of England and

I expect that the OBR will exchange views with a range of organisations and individuals and, when introducing its document today, the OBR made it clear that in this first document it had met a range of organisations and individuals. In that context, of course, I would expect the OBR regularly to talk to the Bank of England, and each would be very interested in the other's approach to these matters. However, it is critical that at the end of the day the OBR acts independently of the Monetary Policy Committee, of the Treasury and of all these other fine forecasting bodies.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000098"></a>These are important matters, and I hope that I have clarified the intention of the legislation in these areas. However, I believe, as do the majority of noble Lords who have spoken, that the OBR's forecasts must ultimately be independent. Therefore, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="101129-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="10112935000100"></a>Secondly, on the question of whether the official forecast is to be predominant-a point that the opposition Front Bench made-it seems to me that the whole fanfare at the original press conference was saying, "No more fiddling figures by the Government or the Treasury-we will have a totally independent forecast". Now we are told that it will be an independent forecast, but that the Government, if they do not like the OBR's figures, might perhaps produce their own. I fail to see the point of the entire exercise if this is so. We will no doubt wish to return to this later, but, meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="1011291000003"></a><b><a name="101129-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1011291000131"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor of Hever):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans (Andrew Robathan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1011291000004"></a>In accordance with the requirements of the EC equal treatment directive, the Ministry of Defence has carried out a review of the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles. The policy was last formally reviewed in 2002.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1011291000005"></a>Considerably more direct evidence is available now than was the case when the previous review was carried out. However, the conclusions are mixed and do not provide the basis for a clear recommendation either way as to whether the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles should be retained or rescinded.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1011291000006"></a>The service chiefs' view is that women are fundamental to the operational effectiveness of the UK Armed Forces, bringing talent and skills across the board. Their capability in almost all areas is not in doubt, they win the highest decorations for valour, and they demonstrate that they are capable of acting independently and with great initiative. But these situations are not those typical of the small tactical teams in the combat arms which are required deliberately to close with and kill the enemy. The consequences of opening up these small tactical teams in close-combat roles to women are unknown. Other nations have very mixed experiences.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1011291000007"></a>In the light of the inconclusive results of the research and the views of the service chiefs, I have concluded that a precautionary approach is necessary. Accordingly, the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles while ensuring that the maximum numbers of trades are available to provide opportunity to those women who wish to serve their country will continue.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1011291000008"></a>In parallel with this Statement, I am publishing a full report on the review, including the research that was carried out, on the department's website at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/PersonnelPublications/EqualityandDiversity/Gender/WomenInCombat.htm">http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/PersonnelPublications/EqualityandDiversity/Gender/WomenInCombat.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1011291000010"></a>The Treasury has today published a report required under Section 231 of the Banking Act 2009 covering the period from 1 October 2009 to 31 March 2010.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="1011291000011"></a><b><a name="101129-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="1011291000133"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> My honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1011291000012"></a>The Government are today revising the Debt Management Office's (DMO) 2010-11 financing remit to reflect revisions to the net financing requirement. The net financing requirement for 2010-11 has been revised upward-by £0.2 billion-from £162.5 billion at the June Budget to £162.7 billion. The revisions to the net financing requirement arise from the net effect of:</p>
a reduction in the central government net cash requirement (CGNCR) of £1.9 billion;an increase in sterling financing for the official reserves of £2.0 billion; andadditional secondary gilt market purchases by the DMO of £0.1 billion.
<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1011291000013"></a>The downward revision to the CGNCR is a reflection of revisions announced today by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to the fiscal aggregates, which have a consequential impact on the CGNCR. The revisions are set out in the OBR's <I>Economic and Fis</I><I>cal Outlook</I><I> November 2010</I>, published today.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1011291000014"></a>The increased funding for the official reserves has been provided to meet potential calls under the UK's IMF commitments. These commitments have recently expanded following parliamentary approval in July 2010 of the UK's increased contribution to the IMF's new arrangements to borrow. This delivered the UK's share of the G20 agreement to treble the resources available to the IMF.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1011291000015"></a>The increase in the net financing requirement of £0.2 billion will be met by an increase in the gilt issuance programme in 2010-11 of £0.2 billion. Gross gilt issuance for 2010-11 is now projected at £165.2 billion.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1011291000016"></a>The planned Treasury bill stock as at 31 March 2011 is £60.8 billion-unchanged from the projection at the June 2010 Budget (and compares with levels as at: 31 March 2010-£63.3 billion; 31 March 2009-£44.0 billion).</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1011291000017"></a>As at the June 2010 Budget, the Government are confirming the net finance target for National Savings and Investments to be a zero net contribution to financing, within a range of +/- £2 billion.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1011291000018"></a>For 2010-11, gross gilt issuance of £165.2 billion is projected to be split as follows:</p>
£52.7 billion of short maturity gilt issuance (31.9 per cent of total);£38.2 billion of medium maturity gilt issuance (23.1 per cent of total);£40.5 billion of long maturity gilt issuance (24.5 per cent of total); and£33.8 billion of index-linked gilt issuance (20.5 per cent of total).  


<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS115"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column WS115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1011291000019"></a>This proportionate split is unchanged from that announced in June 2010.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1011291000020"></a>Auctions will remain the Government's primary method by which gilts are issued. The Government will continue to use supplementary methods-syndication, mini-tenders and the post auction "top up" facility-to issue gilts in the remainder of 2010-11. For 2010-11, it is projected that:</p>
£132.0 billion will be issued by pre-announced auctions (79.9 per cent of total);£26.2 billion will be issued by syndication (15.9 per cent of total); and£7.0 billion will be issued by mini-tender (4.2 per cent of total).
<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1011291000021"></a>Consistent with provisions in the DMO's financing remit relating to the post auction "top-up" facility, average auction sizes in the remainder of the year will be reduced but there will be no change to the number or timing of auctions scheduled for the remainder of 2010-11.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1011291000022"></a>The Government are also publishing today a revised estimate of the fiscal impact of <I>Spending Review 2010</I>, based on the OBR's autumn forecast. Copies of this document have been deposited in the Libraries of the House and are available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="1011291000107"></a>In recent years we have gained a better understanding of the risks of transmission of infectious diseases like hepatitis from poorly maintained healthcare premises and instruments which have not undergone effective decontamination. The risk to individual dental patients is small but, with 1.5 million people undergoing dental treatment each week and some 500,000 people infected

<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><a name="1011291000108"></a>Because of this risk and evidence that some dental practices might not be achieving adequate standards, the department issued <I>He</I><I>alth Technical Memorandum 01-05: Decontamination in P</I><I>rimary </I><I>Care D</I><I>ental </I><I>P</I><I>ractices</I> in November 2009. In implementing the HTM we have sought to strike a balance between protecting patients and the constraints imposed by the layout and structure of dental practices which, while being easily accessible in the high street, may have limited scope for expansion and upgrading.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="1011291000109"></a>I am today publishing the report of the dental national decontamination survey which was undertaken at the start of the year. The primary aim of this,  the first national survey of current standards of decontamination in primary care dental practices, was to provide a baseline to compare standards in general dental practice at the time of issue of the HTM01-05 with those set in the guidance. The HTM is intended to encourage continuous improvement in local decontamination by giving dental practices a range of options to achieve the essential quality requirements (EQR) identified in the HTM and progress to best practice.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="1011291000110"></a>EQR is a level of decontamination which will achieve significant risk reduction, whilst best practice offers an optimum level of protection. The main features of best practice are the provision of a dedicated room for decontamination away from where clinical care is delivered and the use of an automated washer-disinfector, for the cleaning of instruments.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="1011291000111"></a>All practices are expected to be operating at essential quality requirements by the end of this year; no timeframe has yet been set for the achievement of best practice because of the need for further information to be obtained about the constraints imposed by the design and structure of some dental practices.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="1011291000112"></a>I am very grateful to the primary care trusts (PCTs) and the dental practices which participated in this voluntary survey, and to the Health Protection Agency, which worked with the department in bringing it to completion. In total 75 PCTs participated in the survey, which involved nurses with training and experience in infection control visiting 487 randomly selected dental practices. Practices were assessed in relation to essential quality requirements and best practice at the time that the HTM was published.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="1011291000113"></a>The results of the survey showed that around 70 per cent of practices were already working at EQR with some 20 per cent of practices already achieving best practice. Approaching 20 per cent of practices were very near EQR with the remaining minority operating at an unsatisfactory standard.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="1011291000114"></a>These results show that the majority of practices were meeting EQR and it is likely that this figure would have increased over the year as practices began to implement the HTM.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="1011291000115"></a>I was very encouraged to learn that well over two-thirds of practices were already meeting EQR. As to the remainder, the survey data show a number of practices need to improve their cleaning of instruments, which

The department is encouraging practices to acquire automated washer-disinfectors, whose use is a feature of best practice, to achieve a uniformly high standard of cleaning of dental instruments.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="1011291000116"></a>The department has, in collaboration with the Infection Prevention Society, produced a self-assessment audit tool to allow all dental practices to assess their level of compliance with the quality standards in the guidance. By applying the audit tool, practices will be able to compare their standards to those included in the sample survey.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="1011291000117"></a>The quality of local decontamination will be one of the factors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) will take into account in monitoring standards when dental practices are brought within its remit from April 2011. The CQC will wish to ensure that it only registers practices that can demonstrate local decontamination is carried out to acceptable standards.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="1011291000121"></a>On 6 September 2008, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) granted India an exception to its guidelines to permit exports to Indian civil nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. The UK was a long-standing and strong supporter of the need for such an exception to allow India to develop its civil nuclear power sector for peaceful purposes.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="1011291000122"></a>Following this announcement, the UK has developed a strong civil nuclear relationship with India, in line with our non-proliferation commitments and international obligations. The UK-India Civil Nuclear Co-operation Declaration, signed on 11 February this year, was a joint statement of our intent in this area. In light of our enhanced relationship following the recent high-level visit, the UK Government would like to restate their policy towards nuclear-related exports to India, the details of which are as follows.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS120"></a><b>29 Nov 2010 : Column WS120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="1011291000123"></a>The UK is committed to allow the promotion and facilitation of trade and other commercial activities between India and the UK relating to the peaceful civil use of nuclear energy to help India meet its energy needs, taking into full account both India and the UK's respective international commitments and obligations. At the UK-India summit in New Delhi on 29 July 2010, the Prime Minister and Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh welcomed the opportunities that had opened up for co-operation in the civil nuclear power sector, including with regard to nuclear trade and exchanges between scientific institutions.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="1011291000124"></a>The UK's position is a reflection of the positive approach that India is taking in addressing the issue of nuclear proliferation, which is of mutual concern to both countries. It is also a reflection of the agreements and commitments India has made-in particular, India's move towards separating its military and civil nuclear programmes and implementing IAEA safeguards at its civil nuclear facilities.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="1011291000125"></a>Prior to the Nuclear Suppliers Group exception, the UK's policy was to refuse export licences for all NSG trigger list items to India.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="1011291000126"></a>In November 2008, the UK revised this policy, and has since assessed all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the NSG guidelines for nuclear transfers as applied to India, as well as our wider Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations. In line with the NSG guidelines, the UK will authorise the transfer of NSG trigger list exports to IAEA-safeguarded civil nuclear facilities when satisfied that the transfers will not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive activities, or be diverted to acts of terrorism.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a><a name="1011291000127"></a>The UK will continue this policy. As set out in the NSG guidelines:</p>
for an NSG trigger list export, we will continue to take into account whether its export is for peaceful purposes, whether it is destined for a nuclear facility safeguarded by the IAEA and whether there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded facility. To this end, the UK will seek assurances from the Indian Government that the export will be used only for safeguarded nuclear activities which are not related to nuclear explosive activities; andfor an NSG dual use list export, we will continue to take into account whether its export is for a nuclear-related end-use, whether it is destined for a nuclear facility safeguarded by the IAEA and whether there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity.
<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="1011291000128"></a>The UK will therefore only licence the export of NSG controlled goods to nuclear fuel cycle activities safeguarded by the IAEA, or for non-nuclear related end uses where we do not assess there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity.</p>

<a name="101129-wms0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a><a name="1011291000129"></a>We will also favourably consider applications to export licensable items other than those controlled by the NSG to India for a nuclear-related end-use, including those assessed as licensable under the WMD end-use

In particular, such assessment will take into account:</p>
the utility of the items for export to a nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activity; the legitimacy and credibility of the stated end-use; the nature and business of the stated end-user (including whether they are linked to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity or nuclear explosive activity); and any diversionary concerns.

Where an export licence is required for such co-operation, the UK will continue to assess applications on a case-by-case basis in line with the NSG guidelines. Such assessment will take into account whether the transfer is of information already in the public domain or is assessed as basic scientific research, as well as the standard provisions of UK export control legislation.</p>

No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up front and students from families with incomes of £25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of £3,250 a year. Students starting part-time courses in 2012-13, often those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs so long as they are studying at an intensity of at least 33 per cent of a full-time course.</p>

<a name="101129w0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_45"></a><a name="10112934000075"></a>We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation, and greater government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Universities wanting to charge more than a £6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new £150 million National Scholarships Programme. This work will be further supported by the £2.5 billion pupil premium to turn their school-based achievement into success at university.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_46"></a><a name="10112934000076"></a>Participation in higher education has improved in recent years. In 2008-09 88 per cent of young entrants to full-time degree courses in England were from state schools. However, there is more to do. Access will remain a focus for all institutions, which will continue to submit a widening participation strategic assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Universities charging above the £6,000 threshold will draw up a new access agreement with the director of fair access, who will expect most of those whose records show they have furthest to go in securing a diverse student body.</p>

This is different, for instance, from the whole word approach, or guessing words according to picture clues.</p>

<a name="101129w0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_64"></a><a name="10112934000126"></a>Synthetic phonics refers to an approach where  children learn to use their knowledge of the relationship between letters and sounds to blend together the  individual sounds in words to read them, and the reverse process of segmenting words to spell them. Unlike other approaches, with synthetic phonics phonemes (sounds) associated with particular graphemes (letters) are pronounced in isolation and blended together (synthesised). For example, children are taught to take a single-syllable word such as cat apart into its three letters, pronounce a phoneme for each letter in turn, and blend the phonemes together to form a word.</p>

<a name="101129w0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_65"></a><a name="10112934000127"></a>We are committed to strengthening the use of systematic synthetic phonics in the teaching of early reading. The evidence is clear that good synthetic phonics teaching leads children to the next stage-of becoming fluent and confident readers and writers. There is also evidence that synthetic phonics has a major and long-lasting effect on children's reading and spelling attainment.</p>
