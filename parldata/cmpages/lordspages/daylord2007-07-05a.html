The Government do not intend to extend these measures or propose new legislation at this stage, preferring to see industry-led solutions, but are considering a case for events of national significance.</p>

He will appreciate that it will come as a disappointment to sports governing bodies and arts organisations which find that the activities of ticket touts are disruptive to their business and expensive to control. They cause disorder in the streets and make it impossible to give a decent deal to fans, who are ripped off by the touts.</p>

<a name="70705-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07070542000024"></a>Is my noble friend aware that the sort of problems we experience at Cardiff, where we may have a football match one week, which is controlled by the legislation on touting, but a rugby match or concert the following week, which is not controlled, are extraordinarily difficult to deal with? The problems will be multiplied when the Olympics come, with venues used for Olympics events, such as Lords for archery and the test match the following week. How can we get some consistency in the way in which ticket touting is dealt with?</p>

Of course, under the Public Order Acts, we have restrictions on football ticket sales in order to maintain the necessary segregation of fans, the absence of which has in the past caused mayhem at some football occasions.</p>

Certainly, sports organisations and organisations such as his own at the Millennium Stadium resent the profit taken by some people who sell tickets on for that purpose. But a great deal of the resale of tickets is by ordinary members of the public who cannot get to an event to which they intended to go. It would be very difficult to legislate against that resale.</p>

We would exclude the fans at whom the sale of tickets has been aimed. With online facilities and much better opportunities to buy and sell tickets, what function is preserved by allowing people to take an extra profit and to rip the public off in this way?</p>

The noble Lord will know that we potentially will have very great difficulty in enforcing any law under those terms, which is why, even under the existing position with regard to ticket touts and the resale of football tickets, the authorities do not always think that it is right to use the force of the law. The noble Lord is right that there is a problem with online reselling. That is why we have been involved in consultation with the industry to seek to improve practices where resale occurs online; for example, making sure that the original value of the ticket is stated so that the person who is proposing to purchase a ticket knows the accurate value rather than any additional value that someone else might add to it.</p>

Those bodies are putting their case fairly forcefully and, as my noble friend Lord Faulkner indicated, they are pressing for legislation. The Government of course take on board those representations but we also have an obligation to the wider public. Our survey of wider public opinion on this matter shows that the ordinary punter would not want the law to come down to prevent the resale of tickets.</p>

It is about the acquisition of large numbers of tickets, probably legitimately, by people who then sell them on at an inflated price. Does he also accept that in relation to the arts the Government&#146;s position on events of national significance is not going to be of any great help, given that it is a day-to-day problem, particularly in London, and the unavailability of tickets, particularly for hit shows, at other than very

I hear what my noble friend says about what I presume is mainly the London theatres. She will recognise that there is legitimate secondary sale and disposal of London theatre tickets. There are ticket operators who legitimately perform what is a valued service. But as she rightly indicates, the danger and problem is that others come into that market with much more malign intentions than just offering a service to the public.</p>

It is very well known that, for example, you can find on websites such as amazon.com tickets at greatly inflated prices with a lot of money being made out of them by the people concerned. I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that he is examining online reselling, which is very difficult to control. I know that for some arts events it is impossible to buy tickets in the normal way because a lot of these tickets have been swept up and sold on Amazon at a great profit, which prevents other people getting them at the proper price. It is a serious problem.</p>

On the latter, we are looking to see whether legislation might help with regard to those regular events where the sporting authorities are pressing us for some control over the resale of tickets. But the noble Lord will recognise that there are other areas which are much looser in these terms and what goes on on eBay is what other people take advantage of.</p>

These plans will be performance-managed by the MMC programme team. The employment commitment will help trusts to manage any service gaps which might otherwise have existed. The employment commitment covers eligible MTAS applicants who are in substantive employment on 31 July. This includes all doctors in deanery-approved training posts or with a substantive contract. It does not cover locum doctors or doctors on short-term contracts.</p>

First, the number of doctors in training who do not have posts is not entirely clear yet. Of course, a second round of applications is beginning now and will end on 31 October. At the end of that process, some doctors will not have training posts. However, that was always the case. The vast majority of those doctors will still have jobs; it is merely that they will not be in training. As to the way in which patients will be treated after 1 August, junior doctors have changed in hospitals at the beginning of every August. We are confident that there will be proper continuity of care and safety for patients.</p>

It is therefore already beginning to address that market. The noble Baroness was reflecting on the impact on commercial television of the restrictions on advertising for certain foodstuffs. That impact is direct and has caused Independent Television, for example, to reduce the number of children&#146;s hours. A cost is involved in these changes, but the Government took a view that reflected the consensus of the nation: that it was necessary to protect the health of our children by restrictions on food advertising.</p>

These films do exist and some quite remarkable work is done. I commend to the House an extraordinary series made by the BBC World Service and the British Council called &#147;African School&#148;. It was a wonderful series of seven films, but it was put on late at night and was almost impossible to find. So long as we have a television system in this country judged principally on the basis of the ratings that it achieves, these excellent programmes will be marginalised and not seen, and we will be having debates such as this.</p>

In this research, will he note that, when gender is brought into the equation, girls born in September are 50 per cent more likely to get a university place than boys born in August? That suggests that maturity, as powerfully indicated by gender and age at entry, is a major factor in the educational opportunities being offered to our children. We are seriously failing children who, through their relative lack of maturity, are not responded to properly by the educational system. This needs to be researched, and I welcome the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

There was a rule to the effect that you could not take the higher school certificate examination until the year in which you reached your 18th birthday. The qualifying year ended on 31 August. In consequence, as my birthday is on 16 September, I found myself almost a year older than many of my contemporaries.

The specific answer to my noble friend is that head teachers have the flexibility that she mentioned. However, as she may be aware, there is a big debate in the international education community about the virtues of holding children back for a year if their progress is less than should be expected for their age. That is not common practice in this country, but it is elsewhere. I have pages of research evidence on the pros and cons of both systems. Suffice it to say, as so often with these educational debates, the result is inconclusive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07070542000096"></a>The amendment is in some ways a probing amendment, although it is suddenly and unexpectedly topical following the Statement on the constitution on Monday, when the Government announced all sorts of interesting things. We are clearly embarking as a House, a Parliament and a country on another major debate about constitutional affairs. That is something that I personally and the Liberal Democrats generally very much welcome. However, the interesting thing about the Statement on Monday was how little it said about the issues covered by the amendment; in fact, it had nothing at all to say about them. I think that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, who noted that the Statement did not mention devolution once. Devolution and decentralisation to local government do not seem to be seriously on the Government&#146;s agenda, although there are some rather minor aspects of them in the Bill.</p>

Of course nobody is saying that partnerships are not important and that local government should not take part in partnerships&#151;of course it should&#151;but where does the locus of power, of decision-making and of authority

Local government has been stripped of powers over the years by what might be kindly called an evolutionary process. It is time to take a long, hard look at just how much power can be returned to local government and provided to it in areas for which it traditionally has not had responsibility. This amendment sets out one way of doing that.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07070542000098"></a>The precise details of the devolution commission&#151;the standing commission that I am suggesting&#151;are not perhaps vital now. What is important is the principle that there should be a free-standing autonomous body which is representative not just of central government but of local government and which is responsible for looking at issues outside the traditional framework of government and Whitehall departments.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07070542000099"></a>People at the centre have a vested interest in maintaining powers there&#151;that is where they are and that is what they do&#151;and they may be suspicious of anybody else trying to do these things, particularly if powers are devolved to a range of authorities in different parts of the country that might make different decisions. There might be a diversity of provision, which is anathema to people who want uniformity. Clearly, there have to be standards and minima beyond which people cannot go, but the degree to which local government is now in a stranglehold of detailed rules, regulations and targets is a scandal.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07070542000100"></a>The Bill perhaps goes go a little way towards relieving that, but it is only a little way. Something much more fundamental is required. The amendment is therefore more than a probing amendment; it is a challenging amendment. It challenges the Government to say whether they agree with it and what their vision is for local government.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07070542000101"></a>I will briefly refer, if I may, to the Green Paper <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, which was published on Monday. On page 10, the first bullet point in paragraph 7 says that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000770"></a>&#147;power remains too centralised and too concentrated in government&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000694"></a>I am not quite sure what the second part of that means, but if the Government believe that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000771"></a>&#147;power remains too centralised and too concentrated&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000695"></a>at the centre, what will they do to release it? Are they seriously going to let go?</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07070542000102"></a>On page 49, paragraph 169 talks about local communities. Some of this stuff was in the White Paper and some of it is in the Bill. The Green Paper talks about &#147;empowering&#148;&#151;I use the Government&#146;s words in the hope that they might understand&#151;and &#147;engaging&#148; citizens and neighbourhoods and devolving more power directly to the people. A number of interesting ideas are set out. Again, on the next two pages, a requirement is placed on local authorities to,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000772"></a>&#147;consult and involve local people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000103"></a>An odd thing about these pages is that the word &#147;new&#148; keeps cropping up. There is nothing new about all this; many local authorities have been doing it in different ways very successfully. Later in Committee I  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will talk about one or two of the ways in which we do it in Pendle. The Green Paper talks of examining,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000773"></a>&#147;new ways in which to strengthen the ability to influence local decisions ... and a new provision for local communities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000696"></a>to look after local budgets and so on. Again, that is nothing very new in some places.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07070542000104"></a>The point is that the Government are absolutely right to be looking very hard indeed at the relationship between government and Parliament, which is what most of the Green Paper is about. They are also absolutely right to be looking at the way in which people living in streets and communities can get involved in local decision-making. But somewhere in between&#151;at regional level and local authority level&#151;there is a great void in the Government&#146;s thinking and proposals. Unless they are prepared to have democratically elected local authorities that have real powers, can achieve things and can raise funds to achieve those things, then all the local engagement in the world is no use. It is a complete waste of time engaging with a local authority whose powers have been emasculated and whose ways of working are subject to the stranglehold of detailed rules and regulations from on top.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07070542000105"></a>Let us have a bonfire of all those regulations. Let us have a sustained and serious devolution of powers from the centre to local authorities over a period of years. It is no good trying to have a big bang; you need to do it slowly, steadily and evolutionarily, and get a new culture. Until you do that, all that local involvement will do is produce immense frustration because people will get involved but nothing will happen. I therefore have great pleasure in begging to move the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07070542000107"></a>I think that the Government have now come to quite a good analysis of some of the problems of the democratic deficit, centralisation and so on that face our country; the problem is the inadequacy or insufficiency of the actions that they are taking to deal with those problems. The White Paper and the Bill are fundamentally prescriptive on the nature of the relationship between local councils and their citizens, a theme that was very much picked up in Tuesday&#146;s Green Paper on governance, which contains a lot about the rights of citizens to challenge their councils in various ways and hold them to account. We absolutely agree with that.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70705-0003.htm"/>


<a name="70705-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07070542000108"></a>However, what is not in the paper or the Bill is any sense of what the relationship between central and local government should be like. Local government feels that it is very much at the whim central diktat. In the Bill, executive arrangements are forced on to local council regardless of whether they want them or how badly they are performing. Councils&#146; financial freedoms are increasingly curtailed. The amount of ring-fenced or specific grant for local authorities is increasing annually, currently at about 60 per cent.  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Not only are local councils raising a very small amount of money themselves&#151;about 25 per cent&#151;but about 60 per cent of their total spend can be spent only in ways determined by central government.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07070542000109"></a>We hear only today from Hazel Blears at the LGA conference that citizens are now to determine how further parts of the budget are spent. That may or may not be a good idea; I do not know because I have not seen the details. However, the fact that a Minister goes to a meeting and tells the local government sector, &#147;This is how it&#146;s going to be&#148;, without discussing whether it is practical or desirable or whether anything like it has already been done, demonstrates an attitude that indicates that certain parts of government have not quite got the idea of devolution. They seem to be saying, &#147;We will devolve only where we think it is a good idea and where you, local government, cannot do any harm&#148;. Actually, devolution means allowing local councils to make choices. Sometimes they will be wrong. Devolution means allowing people to try things and to make mistakes occasionally.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07070542000110"></a>The Bill does not do anything to address the growth of that part of the public sector that is not covered by democratic institutions&#151;quangos, in other words. Quangos are now outspending local government and in some respects have a more profound effect on local areas than local councils do. However, there is no real sense of how a devolutionary agenda might be used to influence the way in which quangos work.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07070542000111"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendment provides a framework to carry forward the Lyons review and the general devolutionary sentiment that is now current in all three major political parties. It is a chance to explore not just how the relationship between central and local government and citizens works, but also the fundamental relationship between local authorities and the Government. Paragraph 179 of Tuesday&#146;s Green Paper mentions the development of a concordat between central and local government. My noble friend&#146;s amendment would provide a framework for moving that proposal forward.</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>

The Statement and the Green Paper were clear in their analysis and description of what the Government meant by devolution. For example, there was strong mention of London and city regions, but scant reference to the structure of local government as it exists today. There was also the reference to a concordat&#151;a nice vague word&#151;and a page and a half on regions and responsibility.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07070542000113"></a>It seems clear that the Bill is an enabling mechanism to make it possible to end with a structure that is regional in England, with devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That structure goes over all those institutions, including local government, that might be aspiring to some kind of independence, and reaches down into something called communities.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07070542000114"></a>There is no definition of &#147;community&#148; in any government document produced to date. I know when I go to the village in which I live in North Yorkshire

It is a real community. However, when I come to Westminster, where is my community? Is it Westminster? Is it London? What is it?</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07070542000115"></a>There are many references to local people and to their rights, which are described in a way that means that what they are supposed to do is to hold administrators to account. According to this Green Paper, it does not really matter whether the people in the local government structure that we know today are elected.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07070542000116"></a>Under the new dispensation, it is not clear whether the Prime Minister minds that there was a referendum in the north-east that rejected the proposal for an elected regional assembly. He may prefer to have appointed regional bodies. Therefore, I believe that this Bill is an enabling mechanism to increase centralisation and central control. It has nothing in it to make it at all likely that local democracy will be revived in the way that the majority of noble Lords would wish.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="07070542000117"></a><b><a name="70705-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070542000878"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves. I became interested in devolution when conducting research on comparative economic development across Europe and looking at the role of regional redevelopment and regeneration. It became clear that the parts of Europe where there was considerable regional devolution were moving forward faster&#151;Barcelona could be an example. That was because the local authority had the power to go to the market to raise money in bonds and to go ahead with ideas of its own volition as distinct from always having, as in this country, to go hat in hand to the Treasury to say, &#147;Please Sir, may we do this?&#148;.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07070542000118"></a>Time and again, as in the Green Paper published earlier this week, we see the statement that we need more devolution because we are a centralised country. Indeed, we are the most centralised country in Europe&#151;in the whole world, I think&#151;in terms of governance and economy. Everyone used to pour scorn on France. One used to say that one always knew what the schools were studying at a particular hour of the day because that was laid down centrally. In the 1980s, France went for major devolution under Mitterand and the provinces now have a considerable element of autonomy to do their own thing. In the comparative development of provincial France, again, it was this power to do their own thing that I judged gave the provinces considerable advantages over the English regions. The Lnder in Germany have considerable statutory powers to do their own thing. We should remember that this type of governance was set up on British advice in the post-war period to prevent the centralised state from abusing power. We deliberately created the Lnder system to do this.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07070542000119"></a>I feel strongly about two issues. I have already referred to one, which is economic devolution. It seems an insult to local democracy that we now have in this country a Government at the centre who dictate to local government not only what it may spend, as my noble friend Lady Scott made clear, but, through the capping system, what it should tax. What  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater insult is there to a country, which is sometimes regarded as being the mother of democracy and whose democracy was built on the tenet of &#147;no taxation without representation&#148;, that the Government are telling us what we may tax at a local level? In a form of stealth tax and through the squeeze imposed by limits on what local government may spend on social services, the Government frequently pass on unpopular decisions, such as those affecting the care of the elderly. That is dictated through these mechanisms.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07070542000120"></a>Another issue is capital. I have already referred to the fact that in other countries metropolitan authorities can go to the market and raise money through bonds. That is not allowed in this country, where no local authority can raise money directly from the market. In America, the states and cities have their own credit rating; an equivalent process could happen here for local authorities. Devolution is extremely important and economic devolution is an important part of that process.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07070542000121"></a>Secondly, I wish to consider the degree to which the Government have devolved authority to quangos. We are again seeing the giving of power to academies to do their own thing&#151;to opt out of the national curriculum. What is the academy? It is a group of people who can raise &#163;2 million towards the cost of a new building and then can have a governance role in relation to the whole school and decide its ethos. Not only is the academy totally unaccountable to any democratic organisation, but it is put outside the bounds of the community. On these Benches, we feel strongly that education should be community oriented and should serve the local community. Enabling people to set up a school outside the bounds of any form of local accountability is an insult to local democracy.</p>

I cast my mind back to when the Labour Government came to power in 1997. They wanted to devolve more to local government, but recognised that many councils were not in a good enough state to take on more power at that time. They created the Improvement and Development Agency in order to raise standards throughout councils, with a view&#151;I believed&#151;to devolving a lot more power to them.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07070542000123"></a>Subsequently, it is hard to see what has happened. The Improvement and Development Agency has been working for some eight years. Either it has substantially improved the vast majority of councils, in which case the time has come to devolve power to those councils&#151;which is certainly what should happen&#151;or, perhaps, the Minister thinks that councils have not substantially improved, despite the efforts of the Improvement and Development Agency, in which case something is fundamentally wrong. That, too, could well be the case, because of the opaqueness of the finance system and the lack of connection between voters and their councils. Either way, the suggestion in my noble friend&#146;s amendment is absolutely right: this needs a fundamental look. The

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07070542000124"></a>My noble friend Lady Scott mentioned the announcement made by the Minister, Hazel Blears, on giving people power over some of the local spend. It is hardly a new idea. I declare an interest as a former south Somerset district councillor and a Somerset county councillor. The Minister will be aware that the power is already there; we did it in both places. In south Somerset we devolved budgets to a very local level, giving parish councils and local residents the power to say how they would like money to be spent in their area. It is not simply a question of voting on it, but of having a debate to which people are entitled to come and ask questions in their locality. They should not have to travel to some remote and hostile council building at unsuitable times of the day. It is not a simple mechanism whereby you have a referendum on how money should be spent and tick box A, B or C. There is a lot more than that involved.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07070542000125"></a>The Minister also mentioned the idea that councillors might be given a budget. Again, this is hardly new: Liberal Democrat authorities up and down the country have operated very successfully, in consultation with local organisations, the system of a small budget that can pump-prime schemes. These are not new ideas. The Government&#146;s direction of travel quite reverses what it set out to do some 10 years ago. I would be interested to hear from the Minister just what has happened to the concept of improving councils. The goal when the IDA was established was quite short term: councils would be so improved that they would then be in a state to receive back those powers that had been taken away by the previous Conservative Administration.</p>

I make no apology that during the Committee and later stages of this Bill I will be using my knowledge and position as Leader of Essex County Council.

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07070542000127"></a>I remind people that Essex is a very large local authority. We are approaching the size of Northern Ireland and our domestic product is bigger than that of five European countries and eight states of the United States. We do not need regionalism when we have counties operating at that sort of size. Essex is a region in its own right&#151;I want to make that statement right from the start. Therefore, we are rather disappointed to have regional Ministers appointed this week, when we would much rather&#151;as with the general tone of the debate&#151;devolve things.</p>

We are trying, all-party-wise, to get more general support for local government. I have tried since becoming a Member of this House, and we have some good and loyal friends here today. I was interested to note at Second Reading that, while the Bill is so thick and the health bit only thin, most of the debate&#151;almost two-thirds&#151;was on the little health bit rather than generally on local government. That disappointed me, because we have a mammoth bit of local government.</p>

That is why I give a cautious welcome to the amendment. Personally, I am not that keen on commissions. They normally take 10 years to report and I would rather something happened more quickly. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, might reply with a timetable for when the commission will report, because a long commission will do no good. I would rather one Government or another do something now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07070542000130"></a>I would like to give an instance of something we did in Essex, with Radio Five Live, just for localism. I am keen on that. We talk a lot about localism, but we do not do it. In a pilot project with Radio Five Live, we allocated &#163;50,000 to two wards in the middle of Braintree for a project that the community would like. In a period of about seven weeks, the community itself came up with 10 ideas, such as projects for the scouts, a day centre for the elderly, a school and the street scene. Then there was a hustings and the community voted. Within that short time of seven weeks more people voted for a project than in this year&#146;s local election&#151;something like 36 or 37 per cent, rather than 29 per cent. What they voted for was interesting: an improved walk along the canal. They voted for a quality-of-life project. They did not vote for the others, they voted for a walk and for seats along the canal. The local community did that. I would love to do more, but unfortunately the Essex budget cannot give &#163;50,000 all over the place.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07070542000131"></a>That was an interesting idea and we ought to pursue such ideas. Please let communities make some of their own decisions about what they would like. Do not let things always be from the top. Even in a large authority like mine, I want local people to decide what they want from the money raised through the council taxes and government resources. So, I give a cautious welcome to the amendment, because it is in the right spirit, although I am not so sure that I want a commission. I want people just to get on with it now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07070542000133"></a>I do not have as much experience in local government as many of those who have spoken, but I have some. After many years, I have come to the conclusion that a rosy picture is painted of what is wanted by the people&#151;the ratepayer, the foot-soldier or those who are led. In many instances, it is the leaders who are irritated; they want more power, in the belief that that is populist. I do not think that that is necessarily so. In practice, I have sadly come to the conclusion that I have misled myself, and others have misled themselves, into believing that the people are full of ideas and they are simply waiting to be stimulated by an invitation from those who are in charge.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07070542000134"></a>This Government have recognised faults from the past, some of which were their own, and are making a genuine attempt to improve the situation. I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the ideas in the amendment are practical and realistic. If they are not, we have to take account of that. If they are, I very much hope that she will give a nod in the right direction. Sadly, we should not delude ourselves too much that the people of any local community in this country are being stifled from putting forward their ideas. In any community there are good people&#151;politically, socially and environmentally&#151;who take an interest in how their community is governed, managed and financed, but the vast majority are, if I can use the word kindly, apathetic. They are simply willing to be led by those who are elected. We all know about the decline in the number of people who vote in elections. I very much hope that the Minister can be helpful to the House, but the tenor of the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was an insult to the Government and I resent it.</p>

I am delighted to be back at the Dispatch Box representing my department, which has one of the most important and challenging jobs in government. It is a privilege to be able to represent those policies. I thank him for his kind words about my restoration to health. I should also like to say how nice it is to see the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, back on the Front Bench. I send our sympathies for her recent bereavement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07070542000136"></a>This has been an interesting debate. In fact, it has been a sort of Second Reading debate, although I shall forgo the opportunity to make my own Second Reading speech, which I missed at the appropriate time. The issues that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, opened up, which noble Lords around the House have responded to, are the right issues and go to the heart of the Bill. While I am grateful for the welcome that he and others gave to certain parts of the Bill, I am still a bit mystified. I hope that we will explore how it is that we are so much in tune with so much of what has been said by noble Lords about the need to let go and why it is that in this Bill we are indeed letting go of power. That is the whole purpose of the Bill. It is about rebalancing the relationship between local and central government. I urge the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, who disputes this, to stay with us during our deliberations so that we can explore what that will mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07070542000137"></a>Member of the Committee also opened up the debate that was begun by the publication of the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on governance. That underpins much of what we are doing in the Bill. It opens an even wider canvas, creating new possibilities. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, is right that of course some of the ideas that we are exploring are not new. Good councils make innovative progress and decisions. We want to give&#151;I use that word deliberately&#151;an enabling framework for local authorities to use their imagination and innovative ability to pass on power beyond the town hall in a way that has not been done before. I cannot think of a shorthand way of saying that. I cannot pre-empt the nature of the concordat described in the Statement, or the dimensions of the debate, except to say that it is a serious debate about what has been called the new politics and localism. Certainly, Members of this House here today are surely going to see this for the major and innovative opportunity it is. It has been welcomed as such. It is our responsibility to ensure that we have that debate and try to resolve some of those issues. Statements that my honourable friend Hazel Blears has made today about giving assets and community control in various ways are very exciting. This is the first time that any Government have approached the notion of what else local communities want in this way. Let us not underestimate or misrepresent the significance of what this means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07070542000138"></a><I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>, the local government White Paper which we published in October last year, introduced a fundamental rebalancing of the relationship between central and local government. It is a new settlement and a new start. It is what the noble Lord, Lord Best, talked about at Second Reading as a turning point. Yes, noble Lords probably think it is sufficient, but it is a start from which we can make progress in way that we have not done before in this country. It is designed to provide councillors with the scope to work with their local partners and communities to develop better services and better places.</p>

<a name="70705-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07070542000139"></a>On the proposed new clause, I must disappoint the noble Lord. My basic argument is that this proposed standing commission on devolution, while we completely understand the sentiment behind it, does not go far enough for us. Devolving increased powers and responsibilities to regional, sub-regional, local and neighbourhood level not only is the direction of travel that has been articulated, but has been developed in dialogue with, and endorsed by, the Local Government Association. As I have said, it has been set out in the Green Paper <I>The Governance of Britain</I>. The Prime Minister said that he wished to build a new relationship between citizens and government that ensures that the Government are a better servant of the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07070542000140"></a>With the best will in the world, I do not believe that the commission proposed by the noble Lord will be the way of delivering that. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that commissions are slow, cumbersome, sclerotic and become obsessed with

It is an unnecessary element. I look forward to hearing Essex&#146;s unilateral declaration of independence during the passage of the Bill. I did not realise that there were some telling comparisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07070542000141"></a>I want to convince noble Lords that the process that we are engaged with is and should be action-led, organic and represented in the Bill by way of local area agreement, the bonfire of regulations&#151;which I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, accepts&#151;and the abandonment of 1,200 centralised targets. Yes, we can hold our hands up to say that we were overcentralised. We needed to drive improvement by setting some ambitions and measurable targets. We have done that. You only have to look at the number of local authorities that have now achieved the highest standards to see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07070542000142"></a>The principle of the first part of the Bill is improvement and restructuring by invitation. The Government are imposing nothing on local authorities. It is being done by invitation, and local authorities have responded to that. The sense of effective partnership that we are working to reach is about the best solution for each area, determined by each area&#151;those 35 local designated agreements, for example. We know that we need more flexible and organic processes. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that if she is right about economic devolution then the local area agreements that will focus on local priorities will be able to drive the sort of economic devolution that she is so keen on. The sub-national review, which is looking at how sub-regions are capable of taking on functions, will be driving a better form of economic competence at sub-national and local level.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07070542000143"></a>Our challenge is to let go and to do it in a way that enables local authorities to get the best out of what we want for them and they want for themselves. In the Bill, we have a very balanced and nuanced package of reforms. Although I should like to start this debate by agreeing wholeheartedly the need for this commission, I cannot accept the amendment although I understand the intention. Local government and stakeholders are capable of conducting their own dialogue. We do not think that they need this to be centrally imposed. In some ways, this commission is a sort of contradiction of everything that Members of the Committee have said. </p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07070542000144"></a>In conclusion, the Sustainable Communities Bill, which the Government support and which will come before this House next week, already proposes a new way for communities to communicate with local authorities and central government, and will suggest changes on how best to promote sustainable communities. Regretfully, I do not think that the devolution commission will add any value. Our reforms will focus on delivery, responsiveness and not on process. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07070542000146"></a>I am grateful for the comments made by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, who has a long and distinguished career of support for local government, and my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. Ten years ago, Pendle Council looked at seriously decentralising decision-making in Pendle, at the same time involving people from parish councils and local organisations, and citizens. We looked at and then based our system heavily on the South Somerset model, and I pay tribute to the pioneering role which it took.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07070542000147"></a>One reason why I am not in London on a Monday is that on Monday evenings, the NAG meets in my ward. The Minister may think that that is an appropriate name for a body with which I am associated. It is the neighbourhood action group, associated with a neighbourhood management project, which comes because we are a housing market renewal pathfinder and that is how it is financed. That NAG, in an area with no more than 5,000 electors&#151;there are probably 7,000 or 8,000 people at the very most&#151;has an annual budget of &#163;100,000, give or take a bit, for local schemes, grot spots and small local improvements. It effectively makes the decisions by consensus because it consists of councillors, council officers, residents, people from other local agencies, et cetera.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07070542000148"></a>The idea that this is in some way revolutionary is not true. To be able to do this, you must have the money to devolve to this kind of scheme. If you have not got the money because you have been capped or are having 3 per cent cashable efficiency savings every year, it is rather difficult. We can do it because of the housing market renewal pathfinder. We could not do it otherwise. Some of the schemes which have been set up, which I suspect are models for what the Government are doing in their neighbourhood management pathfinders, are there only because extra funding is being provided, and mainstreaming these things is very difficult.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07070542000149"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked about a timetable. It seems to me that what is required is an evolutionary process. I agree with him that what we want is action now but we need a process, a system, a culture and means of delivery which is going to significantly remove controls, bonfire regulations and enhance the powers of local authorities. That cannot be done with a big bang; there has to be some process of doing it over years and I have put one forward. What I propose is much more radical than anything that appears in the Bill. It is on the agenda now. The Minister said very helpfully that what I am proposing does not go far enough. I will think about those words and come back and remind her when I am proposing more. I tabled the amendment to try to put the issue on the agenda, but the Prime Minister has done a much better job of that than I could. The Pandora&#146;s box is open and the discussions of the concordat are going to be absolutely vital. I say to the Local Government Association, &#147;You now have this

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07070542000156"></a>That was a very long and interesting debate on Amendment No. 1. I hope that the debate on Amendment No. 2 will not be quite as long but it is important. We are talking in Clause 2 and onwards about retrospective legislation. There has been no opportunity for Parliament to consider the proposals in this part of the Bill before they were implemented. That is very unusual. The House of Commons was debating this clause about invitations and directions to local authorities to form unitary authorities in February, but the invitations had gone out in January. It has therefore not been possible to either stop or control this aspect of the legislation.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07070542000157"></a>I took exception to Clause 2(1), on the Secretary of State being able to direct &#147;any&#148; principal authority, because that is not what the clause is about. It is about a small number of authorities wishing, or not, to become unitary authorities and the Government opening the door for that to happen. This has put council against council, district against council and council against district. That curious proposal is winding its way through the systems. We did not get &#147;any&#148; principal authority; we got a few authorities, so we cannot have this legislation saying that a Government can go to &#147;any&#148; local authority, because they cannot. That was not what this was about in any event at any time. That is why I am trying to change this to &#147;a relevant&#148; principal authority.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07070542000158"></a>The House of Commons managed to insert into the Bill Clause 3(1)(a), which limited the time for which these provisions could be available, stopping the proposals for putting unitary government to more and more councils. But where did the provision come from? Why is it in the Bill? Why is it in the Bill in a way which allows Parliament no chance to amend it?</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07070542000159"></a>I understand that there were 16 applications originally and that it is likely the Government will go for no more than eight. We have had a turn-up of the local government system and some unhappy and anxious councils being put forward, but we have been able to do nothing about it. I must therefore ask the

I understand that the eight or 16 authorities&#151;which in terms of the number of authorities in this country are trivial&#151;will be advised whether they are going to become unitary authorities by the end of this month. The Bill will have barely finished Committee by the end of this month. It certainly will not have got to Report. By the time we get to Report, as I understand it, the orders will just about have been laid.</p>

The answer should be &#147;relevant to local communities&#148;. The noble Baroness is right: we are in a bizarre situation. I considered whether we should have a go at some wholesale amendments to these clauses, because they seem not to relate to real life&#151;or, at any rate, life as of the beginning of July 2007&#151;but it would certainly be easier to wait until we have heard the explanation.</p>

I hope that by Report the Government can replace these clauses with what they actually mean and tell the world where, if at all, they propose to go forward beyond the current stage. It is okay for us as legislators to grapple with all this as something of a waste of time, but it is not right to have on the statute book the holding out of some sort of lollipop&#151;but not quite giving it&#151;to those authorities, some of which might be disappointed by the announcement we are about to have, and others might be thinking of change in the future.

I returned this morning from a local government conference in Birmingham, which is continuing today. Over the past two days there has been nothing talked about but the chaos in some authorities awaiting decisions which they hope to receive over the next few weeks.

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07070542000165"></a>This has been a grave mistake by the Government. If they intended to do something they should have done it in a different way. For us to be debating this issue now, months and months after it was initiated, is totally wrong. I hope that any future Government will not do it in this way. We have a lot to learn from this and I hope the Minister will be able to give a positive reply to the short debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07070542000167"></a>I should qualify and expand my declaration of interest on the previous amendment. I said that I was a member of Pendle Council; I should remind the House that Burnley and Pendle together put forward an excellent bid for a unitary authority but the Government did not approve it. This was not because of the quality of the bid but because of the problem with the rest of Lancashire. If some authorities within Lancashire were to escape the clutches of the county council, what would happen to the rest? It is absolutely clear that that is why the decision was made. This raises further issues to which I shall come in a minute.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07070542000168"></a>My first point concerns the way in which this whole exercise has pre-empted the passing of the legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to this in moving the amendment, as did my noble friend Lady Hamwee. It is a scandal that this should have happened. Without going back too far, I can remember times in the past&#151;perhaps 25 or 30 years ago&#151;when the Government were trying to increase council house rents, for example, and were telling local authorities to put them up before the legislation had gone through Parliament. That was a great scandalous issue at the time and some authorities said that they would not do it. Nowadays, the Government announce what they are going to do regardless of the legislation, and everyone lies down and does it. The whole culture has changed. But it is still wrong and should not have happened. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, the way in which it has happened has increased the difficulties and caused more confusion.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07070542000169"></a>My second point relates to the timescale. Some authorities, knowing that this might be coming up, had been planning for a long time. However, a timescale of effectively no more than about two months&#151;if you take out the Christmas break&#151;in which to decide whether to put in a bid and to carry out the detailed work necessary behind it was, frankly, ridiculous. It was an absolute shambles. It would have been perfectly easy for the Government to have  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>announced in last September or October that they were going to consider bids, to get the legislation through and to do it. They may say that that would have increased the uncertainty, but at least it would have given people more time to plan, to put in good bids and to talk to other people; it would have given the authorities in a county time to talk to each other and to try to find a consensus, instead of fighting the pitched battles which are taking place in some areas.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07070542000170"></a>The third point, as raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is that the Government have no strategic view about unitary authorities. They started off with a strategic view and said that unitary authorities were good&#151;just as the previous Government did with the changes from the 1992 Act&#151;but, as time has gone on, it has been watered down. I think there were 25 bids originally, 16 were shortlisted and we are told that about eight might be approved. We shall wait and see.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07070542000171"></a>Is unitary government the best system or not? Is there a general presumption that the two-tier system has had its day? I think that the two-tier system set up under the Local Government Act 1972 worked very well in many counties for quite a long time, but in much of the country it is no longer working well for all kinds of reasons that I will not go into now. It is certainly not working well in Lancashire.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07070542000172"></a>A strategic view across England really is needed. If the Government think that this round under the Bill will close the issue down, they are wrong. It will not close the issue down at all; all it will do is put it off for another five or 10 years until it is raised once more and then we will have to go through the whole thing again. Certainly, in a county such as Lancashire, the present situation is frankly not tenable. It certainly will not be tenable under local area agreements and things will have to change. The uncertainty has not been removed; it is there all the time. It has been there now for the past 10 years, it is still there and it will remain until it is properly resolved.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07070542000173"></a>I agree that we are talking about functions rather than structures but we are also talking about communities. It seems that some of the bids being considered in terms of communities are far too large for the geographical area of the unitaries. I am not suggesting that in some cases counties will not make good unitaries. In some of the more compact counties where the districts are traditionally weak&#151;places such as Shropshire or even Cornwall, which is not very compact but has a real sense of community&#151;the unitary model might work. But would it work in North Yorkshire, which extends from the North Sea coast at Scarborough and Filey to within a few miles of Morecambe on the west coast, takes in two national parks and a vast tract of the north of England? The idea that North Yorkshire County Council without districts would be a satisfactory local authority redefines what is meant by local authorities and local government. The fact that that such an idea is being taken seriously indicates a serious flaw in the system.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07070542000174"></a>There is no strategic view. What is the ideal size for a unitary? We are being told that some bids were not really big enough, yet they are bigger than some of  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1152"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the existing unitaries; for example, in Lancashire and the north-east. Are we looking for compact unitaries such as Blackpool or Blackburn, or are we looking for great big sprawling counties such as North Yorkshire or Cumbria? There is no overall strategic view. I do not think a satisfactory solution can be found until a decision is made. I may not agree with that decision but at least one has to be made as to whether we are looking for compact authorities on perhaps the metropolitan borough model, for which I would be looking, or something much bigger.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07070542000175"></a>The present proposals are a mishmash. They do not really make any revolutionary change to local government; they do not make much change at all; they involve change in just a few parts of the country. Even within the present proposals&#151;we have Exeter, Norwich, and Ipswich on the one hand and North Yorkshire, Cumbria and a unitary Somerset on the other&#151;there seems to be no idea of what it is we are looking for in terms of local government. I would be very happy if the Government withdrew this part of the Bill even though it would upset some of the people who are well on the road towards unitary status and cause real problems in those areas. Whatever happens with this, it is not going to go away; it will come back and if we are preserved long enough we will all be here discussing the same thing in a few years&#146; time.</p>

I invite the Minster to address the specific point of why the process of beginning the formation of unitary councils was started in advance of this legislation. We have had the two-tier system for a long time. While it is right that it should be reviewed from time to time there was actually no tearing hurry. I can see no reason, unless the Minister can give me one, why it was not possible to put the legislation in place and then move forward to the specifics. That would have been more logical in terms of the parliamentary process and would also have avoided some of the problems we now face where local authorities are out there and are more or less to guess why one proposal or another has found favour.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07070542000177"></a>My noble friend has just mentioned the Lancashire example. He believes that it was the effect on the remainder of the county which proved to be the stumbling block. Yet in East Anglia, where I live, both Ipswich and Norwich have moved forward to be considered as unitaries, despite the same issues being raised by the rest of the county. Local authorities are left trying to operate in a sphere that they do not understand. Had we had the legislation first we could at least have debated the principles of unitary authorities and set out some ground rules under which we could operate.</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07070542000178"></a>The debates on the Bill in another place raise more questions than answers. For example, Mr Woolas, who was in charge of the Bill at the time, argued that one of the ways in which bids will be measured is the effect that they will have on council tax. Anyone who knows anything about local government knows that  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1153"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>council tax is not really related to how much local authorities are spending or whether they offer value for money. It is such a complicated system. Council tax is a pretty imperfect way of measuring anything. To determine whether a unitary bid should be favoured simply on the basis of how it affects the council tax is bizarre. It is certainly not clear from what the Minister said what will happen if a proposal is based on some promise made by a council that it will keep the council tax at a particular rate. What if it does not? Will it be capped? How will this work?</p>

<a name="70705-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07070542000179"></a>Councils have put in bids without knowing any of these basic ground rules. Had we had the legislation first, we could have at least established some of those rules. I would like the Minister to address that issue.</p>

We receive 25 per cent of our annual revenue from a county grant. Of course we have been approached by the county and the Teesdale District Council, which seek to know what way forward we support. This has to be done in advance of the legislation. If you are an institution you handle the matter carefully. People are being set against one another in County Durham because there are different schools of thought about what might or might not be the right way. But what is really happening is that people are second-guessing the Government. They know that that is where their money comes from so they are very chary of upsetting central government and they are second-guessing how they are supposed to reply to the request for proposals. This is having a very deleterious effect on County Durham.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07070542000182"></a>Several questions have been asked. Why did the Government pre-empt legislation in the way that they did? Is there an element of retrospection here? Why was it a general invitation rather than an invitation to relevant authorities&#151;although it is not clear from what the noble Baroness said what &#147;relevant&#148; might mean? Then we have had a set of questions about the process of bids being made against the criteria that have been set. I want to set some minds at rest.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07070542000183"></a>I have had to abandon my speaking notes as they are too narrow for the event. But I will start with what it is that we did. Two years ago, almost to the day, the then Secretary of State opened a conversation with local government about the improvements that it wanted to see. It is true that most of that conversation was framed around the benefits that improved working would bring, either as enhanced two-tier authorities or as unitary authorities. They spoke about the some of  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the benefits of avoiding duplication, which we do not need to rehearse. It was a long conversation, and was followed up by the invitation process, which was facilitated by the general powers of the Secretary of State&#151;it did not need legislation. The invitation process led to a consultative process, of which we are now at the second stage, with the Secretary of State looking at the bids that have come forward. It has been a long, careful and thorough process.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07070542000184"></a>If we had started with legislation, which we did not need to do, questions such as those asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, about whether we could not speed up the process, would have been much louder and much more insistent. We have been driven in this process by what we know must be a better way of doing things than the way in which we have restructured local government historically, which has been extremely protracted and debilitating. Yes, it has put pressure on local authorities to think about what they want, but, my goodness, it has meant that they have had to do their thinking and come forward with many proposals for improving what they do which they would have been thinking about anyway. It is about functions; it is about services; it is not about structure.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07070542000185"></a>However, there was no way in which we would have wanted to curtail the process of discussion in legislation; it was just that this was a way of enabling local authorities to move ahead speedily while allowing sufficient time for them to consider the invitation to develop and submit proposals, for a full period of consultation by the Secretary of State, and for proposals to be implemented as soon after commencement as possible in order for the new unitary authorities to be up and running by May 2009. The overwhelming message that we received from local government was that it wanted this process to be over quickly and not drag on for years, as it had in the 1990s. It was part of the devolutionary principle that we did it in this way.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07070542000186"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned retrospection. There is nothing retrospective about the Bill. A retrospective provision makes valid something which was not valid or lawful at the time when it was done. The Bill provides that an invitation issued or a consultation carried out not using the powers of the Bill can lead to unitary proposals to be implemented by it. I am sure that we will have the debate again when we discuss Clause 21, but I reassure noble Lords about the matter because I know that the House takes it very seriously. I have dealt with the wide-ranging prerogative and common law powers of the Secretary of State which enable the invitation to proceed without legislation.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07070542000187"></a>The way in which the invitation was made to local authorities was raised. If we had said that it was available only to some, we would have been in even worse trouble. We always made it clear that it was unlikely that there would be more than a small number of proposals which would eventually find favour. Originally, we said eight, but, because of the high quality of submissions and the good value for money that they offered, we have confirmed that 16 proposals will go through to consultation.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1155"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70705-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07070542000188"></a>There was nothing loose or sloppy about the way in which this was done. The criteria set out in the invitation made absolutely clear what we were looking for, and what local authorities should look for by way of consultation. I cannot account for the nature of local politics, but it was inevitable that there would be anxieties in areas where proposals would be inimical to local politics, geography and history, but it is not the process that was at fault.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07070542000189"></a>The 16 proposals which have come forward for consultation are being extremely carefully considered according to all the processes that we have set up and the guidance that we have given to local authorities. Local authorities have been in no doubt, not least once the primary consultations were made, that it is an iterative process. Those local authorities have consulted long and hard with Ministers and officials during the past few months. They have not been left to work out what to do; it has been clear.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07070542000190"></a>A question was asked about the role of Parliament. We have made provision for affirmative orders when the proposals come forward for implementation. Each will be subject to a vote of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07070542000191"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised criteria in relation to the size of communities. We have said nothing about size; we have said nothing about who should qualify. We have said only that they should meet the criteria set out in the invitation. Those are the sole conditions that we have imposed. We have tried to make that as clear as possible.</p>

If this clause is required only for implementation, why does it start by stating that the Secretary of State &#147;may invite&#148;? This is not implementation; this is setting out the road along which the unitary authorities will be developed. If it can be done under general powers, Clause 2 is not needed in the way in which it is being proposed. The Bill does not state that Clause 2 is required for implementation; it states that

That is the gate through which they go. Whether the Secretary of State has opened that gate and bolted it after the horse has gone through it beforehand is a completely different matter. She may have thought that she was doing that under general powers, but that is not what the Bill says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07070542000196"></a>The Minister has made an effort to satisfy us, but it will not do. I proposed &#147;a relevant authority&#148; because only a limited number of authorities were going to be interested. If there were never going to be a limited number of authorities, which would then be the &#147;relevant authorities&#148;, the legislation should have been implemented on the basis of unitary proposals across the country and not just 16 local authorities. When we get down to the detail, we see that the criteria reduce the number even lower than 16. We are told that, for money reasons as much as anything else, they will be reduced yet again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07070542000197"></a>This part of the Bill is not at all satisfactory.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07070542000201"></a>The central problem with type C proposals is that reorganisation across county boundaries risks totally undermining public consent for anything going ahead through those authorities. Incidentally, if the Minister were to accept our amendment on holding referendums, that might not be a problem, but we will come to that later. Whatever happens on this, the question of public consent is important; it is vital that people identify with the area where they live. We talked about communities in Amendment No. 1. Constituency boundaries, which affect and concern MPs, might change every few years, but I know of none that goes across counties. I am sure that the Minister will comment on this controversial issue. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, the type C proposal on county boundaries is the issue. We have proceeded on the assumption that there is no such case as proposed in the amendment for restricting the options open to councils. Part of the devolutionary approach is to allow as much choice as possible for local authorities, but the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is absolutely right that in the 16 proposals there are none involving type C proposals to cross existing boundaries.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07070542000204"></a>I remind the Committee that my noble friend Lord Hunt, who did such a splendid job while I sat silently coughing beside him, told the House at Second Reading that we have no plans for a further round of restructuring. He also said that the Bill provides for a process under which further invitations to councils could be made if that made sense. There may be circumstances&#151;we are not sure that there would be&#151;where it would be appropriate to invite a council to make a proposal. This is an attempt to cover all eventualities; a council should have as much flexibility as possible to put forward whatever proposal it sees fit. The whole Bill is drafted to enable us to respond to the proposals put forward by local authorities, which understand their areas best. We feel that they should have the flexibility to frame any unitary solution that they might want. The only proviso that we have made is that any new unitary should use existing district boundaries as building blocks.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07070542000205"></a>The Bill as it stands will allow local authorities to bring forward a wide range of options. They will not be constrained in how they may best administer the local government function. Where the three types are set out, in the type C proposal one might indeed have a combination of whole districts and/or counties that are adjoining, so that they can cross existing county boundaries.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07070542000206"></a>Concerns were indeed expressed in the other place about historic boundaries and the meanings that communities quite rightly attach to them. Fears were raised that a type C proposal might be undermined by the lack of local support that it received. I know that your Lordships are thinking about such issues, but I restate that as part of a devolutionary approach it is not for us to restrict proposals; we must allow choices. As cross-boundary working continues to increase, it might be that this is the best solution for one area, and it should be open to areas to put that forward if possible. I am not sure whether the noble Lords involved in the amendment would actually want to limit proposals on this option, or whether that would be wise in allowing scope for local authorities.</p>

It would be rare that one would work across county boundaries, but across the country I can think of authorities that might conceivably have wanted to form unitary boundaries, so I see why the type C option was there to start with. My confusion comes from the fact that Mr Woolas, in the debate in another place, made it clear that the Bill would apply only to the current round of bids and that amendments would be brought forward. Therefore, if there are no type C bids in the current proposals, I cannot understand why there is still a need for these provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07070542000208"></a>From what the Minister has just said, it seems that the Government want to keep the flexibility in the legislation for future type C proposals. In that case, I do not understand what the assurance by Mr Woolas that the Bill would relate only to the current tranche actually means. My confusion is over the point that he made about the Bill. Does it refer only to the current set of proposals, or is it intended that the Bill will be used as a framework for future unitary proposals?</p>

Yet we have to allow for the eventuality that there may need to be an invitation following from changes being made. We do not want to close off that option; it is quite right to provide some flexibility for that in the Bill. Since we are allowing for the other two types, surely it is sensible to allow for the type C proposal. I do not want to make a meal of this. It is not overcomplicated; it is just common sense.</p>

I am totally against changing county boundaries; the unitaries that were created in Berkshire are all called &#147;Bracknell Forest, Berkshire&#148; et cetera. Say that a unitary was created between Yarmouth and Lowestoft. I suppose that that could be done across Norfolk and Suffolk, but some people in that unitary would live in Norfolk and some in Suffolk. That would be crazy; the idea is quite ridiculous. We do not often say that about government proposals, but it is more ridiculous than most things that I have heard to have a unitary across two counties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07070542000211"></a>I am confused because there does not seem to be a bid that I would consider ridiculous in this round, so this provision is not very good at all. People who live in Romford, which went into London in 1964, still think that they live in Essex&#151;and, in a way, would like to come back into it. People have a lot of natural affinity with their counties. We are going to have to come back to this at a later stage. I will not pursue it today, but there is a fundamental flaw in keeping this in the Bill. I will certainly come back to it to try to put it right.</p>

It is unsettling for district council employees and councillors. For the areas involved, it is a significant matter in terms of electoral and governance arrangements. Councils tend to develop their own ethos over the years&#151;a sort of culture and way of behaving.

I understand the intention behind the amendment: she seeks to find out whether a proposal for a county unitary could result in a new authority&#151;a fresh start&#151;rather than an existing county council that simply absorbed the functions of the constituent district councils. The Bill provides for exactly that&#151;for the implementation of a new county council. It is effective through Clause 11(3)(e) and Clause 11(5)(a).

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07070542000229"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment brings us to the words &#147;or direction&#148;. We have just discussed the limitation on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to make directions, which finishes in January. It seems strange that there should be any need for direction at all from the Secretary of State. The process is being done by sending invitations out for voluntary applications by local authorities, if they wish, to come back with unitary proposals. Either the invitation is accepted or it is not. The Minister may say that there are tidying-up bits round the edges that might need direction&#151;for example, if there are recalcitrant and difficult local authorities that do not like the tidying-up bit. However, if that requires direction, we have fallen away from local authorities themselves wanting to put forward proposals. We would like those directions to be removed and we want to ensure that the invitation date is limited as well, so that we can be really clear that this is a limited exercise that will not be undertaken again without the proper legislation.

Indeed, the Minister in an earlier speech made mention of the fact that this process started from a devolutionary point of view, so it seems right that the drive should come from local areas and that the Secretary of State should then invite those areas to come forward with proposals. A power to direct runs completely counter to the devolutionary spirit.</p>

It has always been understood that directions would be issued only where bodies had failed in their duty in such a way that there was no other way out. Directions have been seen as instruments of last resort, in cases of failure. They have also been used to secure administrative arrangements, such as ensuring that accounts are written in accordance with Treasury rules. They have been increasingly used&#151;sometimes not very successfully&#151;for issuing policy directions, which again have tended to be general rather than particular. Is there a relevant precedent for the use of the power to direct as it is included in this Bill?</p>

It is necessary because Amendments Nos. 9, 14, 17 to 21, 23 and 55 to 57 are all about the same thing: they remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct any principal authority to make a proposal under Clause 2, the proposal for unitary reform of local government.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07070542000233"></a>We are certain that the power of directions contained in the Bill is necessary simply to ensure that we are able to bring the present round of restructuring to an orderly conclusion. We need the power so that we can deal with the eventuality which might arise in the immediate follow-up to the current round of restructuring where some residual areas may need to have unitary local government in order for one of the unitary proposals currently on the table to work. It is necessary to see that as a possibility&#151;it may never arise&#151;but in our initial invitation we covered the eventuality. We made clear that assessing the proposal against the criteria must include consideration of the residual area. Our assessment might be that the original unitary proposal meets all five criteria and should be implemented, but only if the residual area were also to be made unitary. For example, we might accept the original proposal but combine that with a direction to the council for the residual area to put forward its own unitary proposal. I want to stress that in practice the need for the power of direction may never arise. We are absolutely clear; we intend that it is available only to complete the current round of restructuring. There is now a third limitation on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to issue such a direction: it can only be given where the Secretary of State believes that it would be in the interests of effective and convenient local government.</p>

It seems to me that that is a recipe for disharmony. Most of Clause 2 and 3 are a recipe for disharmony and if the Minister has received the letters we have had&#151;and I am sure that he has&#151;he will understand how much agitation and angst there is over these proposals by some people who do not want them and find themselves scooped up within in them.</p>

If I may explain, there may be an existing unitary authority which was too tightly bounded because of growth. There would be a strong case for the boundary of the unitary to be expanded and maybe to join with the neighbouring shire district. That is obviously a hypothetical case, but a way achieving that would be to invite a type C proposal for the new unitary. We could leave the invitation open, but if the local debate had already been focused on the merger of the unitary and the neighbouring district, specifying a type C proposal might avoid any unnecessary concerns or worries about what was expected.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07070542000256"></a>This amendment brings back the principle raised in February in a worthy amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, at Third Reading in this House. At that time, the Government accepted another amendment tabled by the noble Lord which extended the deadline by which bus operators can appeal to the Secretary of State against reimbursement arrangements set by local authorities, in relation to the national concession under the Transport Act 2000. The deadline is currently 28 days after the date on which the reimbursement arrangements take effect. The amendment extended it to 56 days in England. I was able to respond favourably to that amendment on the grounds that provision of extra time should offer scope for the full gathering of high-quality data. This could mean that any appeals which operators feel compelled to make are more firmly grounded in empirical evidence. It should also help reduce some of the uncertainty that local authorities might otherwise face from more speculative appeals.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07070542000257"></a>As many appeals are brought jointly under the Transport Act 2000 and the Transport Act 1985, the Government&#146;s amendment in the other place, which we are considering today, proposed changes in respect of appeals requiring operators to participate in concessionary schemes under the Transport Act 1985. Under the current arrangements regarding local authority travel concession schemes under the 1985 Act, an authority running a local scheme can serve an operator with a &#147;participation notice&#148; which requires the recipient to participate in the scheme. The operator can appeal to the Secretary of State against the participation notice, and the deadline for the appeal is currently 28 days from the date of the notice. </p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07070542000258"></a>As noble Lords can see, the Commons amendment would largely mirror, in relation to the Transport Act 1985, the changes already made to the Transport Act 2000 by virtue of Clause 3(4) to (6) of the Bill. It would do so by extending the deadline for appeals against participation notices served by English local  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1165"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authorities in relation to local travel concession schemes. Instead of falling 28 days after the date of the participation notice, the deadline would fall 56 days after the date when the operator&#146;s obligation to participate in the scheme started, or if the relevant bus service is not yet operating, on the date that the obligation would have started had the service been operating. This would help to align the provisions for appeals under the two concessionary legislative regimes.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07070542000259"></a>The last part of the amendment makes a connected change. At the moment, an operator intending to appeal against a participation notice must give the authority notice of his intention to do so either before the operator appeals or, if the participation notice requires it, before the end of a period specified in the notice. Regulations currently provide that this period cannot exceed seven days. This current provision allowing a local authority to specify that operators must give the authority notice of their intention to appeal within seven days, measured from the date of the participation notice, undermines the purpose of extending the appeals period and negates the benefits of giving operators more time to gather data, for example, before appealing.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07070542000260"></a>The amendment would tackle that by providing in effect that the local authority could specify that the operator must give seven days&#146; notice, or such other period as may be specified in regulations, before lodging an appeal. In other words, operators would be entitled to give notice of an appeal at any time before they lodged the appeal, except that if a local authority specified that it would like seven days&#146; notice, or such other time as may be specified in regulations, then at least this notice would have to be given. The amendment would apply only to schemes made by English local authorities.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07070542000261"></a>My colleague in the other place, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Gillian Merron, wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, copied to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on 23 May, when the Government&#146;s amendment was tabled in her name, explaining the Government&#146;s intent. In his reply, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, welcomed the move and said that he would support it when it returned to this House for consideration. I hope that other noble Lords will agree with the noble Lord in that respect. I am always happy when we are able to reach a productive, cross-party consensus on the best way forward. The Bill makes an important improvement in the provision of concessionary travel for older and disabled people in England. It will make a real difference to some 11 million people, and consequently I&#151;and I am sure the whole House, but particularly those of us who engaged in proceedings on the Bill&#151;look forward to its enactment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07070542000264"></a>During the Bill&#146;s passage I repeatedly referred to the problem of local authorities actually spending the money made available under this legislation, and I believe that there will be more money. The Government have shown reluctance to direct local authorities in this respect through agreement to ring-fencing, preferring instead to allow local discretion in the use of these funds. Perhaps the Government could, however, publish a list showing the amount of block grant allocated to each authority for the purpose of meeting the cost of concessions, so that local electors&#151;who I gather under the new Prime Minister are gradually to be given more oversight of what is happening&#151;are aware of the use made of such funds and whether they are being used, topped up or, on the other hand, withheld from the purposes for which they were intended.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07070542000265"></a>I wish to refer briefly to another subject which should be covered in the forthcoming local transport legislation&#151;the question of tackling congestion, which is far and away the most important problem confronting the bus industry. Congestion increases costs and leads to increasing customer dissatisfaction. Local authorities are highway authorities and are charged under the Traffic Management Act with managing the highway, and they have been given increased powers so to do. Many local authorities are not sufficiently active in this field, preferring instead the often loud representations from small shopkeepers and recalcitrant motorists who, if possible, would like to drive in the shop doorway to save them walking any distance whatever. I am sorry to say&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Snape, mentioned when we last dealt with this matter&#151;that some Liberal Democrat councillors are among those who are reluctant to agree to effective highway management measures to ensure that buses have priority.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07070542000266"></a>I have written to the previous Secretary of State saying that where bus services become unreliable because of congestion, the traffic commissioners, exercising enhanced powers, should be able to summon the Cabinet member who is politically responsible for this state of affairs to give a publicly available account of the actions he proposes to take to remedy the situation. With that, I am most grateful to the Minister. I am sure that we have improved the Bill a little.</p>

As he said, this is an example where we can work on a cross-party basis to agree legislation with amendments that seem to satisfy us all. The Bill&#146;s provisions will certainly be welcomed by many. I therefore compliment the Government on one solid and satisfactory piece of legislation. I have nothing further to say, except that I am pleased that the Bill will receive Royal Assent and be implemented next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07070542000270"></a>As for tackling concession and the role of buses in that, the Government are at one with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw&#151;and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield&#151;in recognising that the bus has an important role to play in this country&#146;s public transport provision. In those areas where the bus has been given considerable priority, there have been obvious advantages to the community.</p>

<a name="70705-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07070542000271"></a>We hope that others will recognise those advantages, particularly against the background of the purpose of this measure, which is significantly to increase bus usage. I hope the noble Lord will recognise that I cannot give too many categorical assurances on those points. However, I could not agree more categorically with his amendment or with the narrowness of his original proposal.</p>

Currently, the membership of national park authorities is made up of representatives from all the local authorities in the national park area, including parish councils, along with people appointed by the Secretary of  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>State. This reflects the fact that national parks are a treasure of national significance, yet are places where people have to live and work.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07070542000282"></a>The English National Park Authorities Association has raised concerns about unitary proposals, specifically about how the current balance of the membership of national park authorities will be affected by the creation of unitary councils in their areas. The association is concerned that the creation of unitary councils will give the local authority a more dominant position within the national park authority. Without commenting on whether I think that that is a good or bad thing, I tabled the amendment to give the Minister a chance to, I hope, reassure national park authorities that the department is aware of this issue, particularly because the authorities&#146; normal dealings would be with Defra and it is not unknown for one department not to talk to another. I beg to move.</p>

In this instance, not only are we talking constantly, but I can assure the noble Baroness that we absolutely understand these concerns over the independence of the national parks. As I am sure the noble Baroness knows, on 19 June in the other place, my honourable friend the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced that, where the creation of a unitary authority would result in that authority appointing more than eight members to a national park authority, the Government would review the membership arrangements with a view to reducing the number of local authority appointees.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07070542000284"></a>I am absolutely at one with the noble Baroness about the need to control the impact of unitary authorities on the membership both of the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. I hope that I can persuade her that we do not need the amendments, because they are unnecessary and because they would not have the effect that she seeks. Amendment No 15A would require an authority, in framing a unitary proposal, to have regard to any guidance that the Secretary of State had issued about the potential impact of the proposal on a national park authority or the Broads Authority. It is not for the local authority to consider matters; the Government are responsible for the membership arrangements in the national parks and the Broads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07070542000285"></a>I refer the noble Baroness to the Written Statement of 19 June. The Minister went through all the actions that he would want to take in order to ensure the independence of the authority:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07070542000731"></a>&#147;I have decided that where unitary local government might lead to a single local authority appointing eight or more members on to a national park authority, I shall want to take action in advance to ensure the independence of that authority. If such circumstances arise, I intend to review the membership of each affected national park authority with a view to reducing the number of its local authority appointees.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07070542000732"></a>Where I conclude that it is indeed appropriate to reduce the number of principal local authority seats on any national park authority, I shall also want to reflect on whether that should be

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07070542000733"></a>If I do conclude that it would be appropriate to add some extra seats within the &#145;other&#146; category&#151;for example, those appointed by DEFRA&#151;I would envisage using those new seats to recruit particular qualities that are either under-represented at present or might become so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/6/07; col. 83WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000286"></a>The Minister has certainly thought through the potential impact and how we might safeguard the parks&#146; independence. I am very happy to send the noble Baroness a copy of the Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07070542000287"></a>Amendment No. 22A, as drafted, would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied that appropriate measures were in place before she determined to implement a unitary proposal. I understand what the noble Baroness wants to achieve, but she has created a Catch-22 situation. The amendment would not allow us to decide to implement a proposal until we had put new membership arrangements in place. We cannot do that until we make the order to create the unitary authority et cetera.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07070542000288"></a>Amendment No. 42A would provide the Secretary of State with the power to make an order for the membership arrangements in the national park authorities or the Broads Authority. That is covered by the Bill in Clause 11(4)(e), which allows us to provide for the membership of any public body, including the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. I hope that this reassures the noble Baroness that we are absolutely serious about maintaining the very precious independence of the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. The Bill allows us to do that.</p>

I am sure that it will reassure the National Park Authorities Association. It would be helpful if Defra could begin the process of evaluating the effect on the national park authorities sooner rather than later, given that there are a limited number of local authorities now in contention for unitary status. Of those, very few will have national parks contained within them. It would be better for good governance if these proposals were developed before the changeover, so that there is no battle that results in a hiatus in governance.

It is not a particularly elegant amendment, but it is there because I could not believe that I had reached this point in my reading of the Bill without seeing a reference to consultation. It might be implicit in earlier parts of the Bill, but it is not spelt out or required. If I use the term &#147;retrospective&#148;, the Minister will understand that I do not use it in a technical sense, but this amendment illustrates retrospectively, in lay terms, the very odd situation that we find ourselves in.</p>

It also raises the issue of quality of information and sometimes misinformation&#151;and sometimes, no doubt, information characterised as misinformation&#151;or indeed the completeness of information. The amendment may now be irrelevant, given the timing, but the principle is worth airing.</p>

<ul><a name="07070542000774"></a>&#147;such other persons as he considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000697"></a>I have sought to reinstate the reference to persons whom he believes to have an interest, in order to understand who is appropriate within this provision. It would have seemed to me on a &#147;new reader, start here&#148; basis that &#147;persons who have an interest&#148; would be appropriate. However, the more that I thought about it, the less clear I was which was the wider and which the narrower of the two terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07070542000296"></a>Amendment No. 31 raises the issue of who is a person for this purpose. I suspect that we will be told that it has a very wide definition, but I would like to have that confirmation. Amendment No. 52 concerns the timing of formal consultation and local debate, providing that the Secretary of State&#151;we have now jumped to Clause 21, but the issues are similar&#151;will take full account of representations made at any time before the commencement of the relevant provisions.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07070542000297"></a>That has come about because we have been contacted by local authority members in areas which are in contention&#151;if I go on using that term, at least everyone will know what I mean&#151;where the deadline for responses is around the middle or towards the end of June. Authorities in the relevant areas were known to be submitting supplementary information and the stakeholders, or persons interested, felt the need to be reassured that they would have the opportunity to comment on or rebut any of the materials included in that supplementary presentation. I understand that they asked the department what its position would be on that, but that, at that time, they had not had a response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07070542000298"></a>It is important that the process commands confidence. We may have shown a lack of confidence today, but I hope that at the end of the process there will be confidence in what has happened. It is important that those who are assessing the bids are able to take account of everything that is presented to them. I beg to move.</p>

There are a few stakeholders here and there and one or two others, but the local electorate seem to have been entirely left out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07070542000300"></a>Amendment No. 25 would extend the time within which it is possible to make representations to the Secretary of State following a proposal by the Boundary Commission. I regret that I have not seen the guidance on the clause that was promised to my honourable friend Robert Syms in another place. I do not know whether it has not been issued or whether it just has not come my way. If it has been issued, I should be extremely grateful if it was placed in the Library for reference between now and Report. I am sure that that was overlooked, if it has been issued, but it would be helpful to have it.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07070542000301"></a>The current provision for a four-week period in which to make representations following a Boundary Commission report is simply not enough for councils and individuals to galvanise views and put together a convincing case. Even the two months that I propose in Amendment No. 25 would provide only just enough time to carry out a consultation in response to the proposals. I have proposed a shorter time than I would otherwise as a conciliatory gesture, but I am not sure whether it will be accepted. I hope that the Government can meet us on this because it is important not only for the interests of those who want a fair amount of time to make representations, but so that, in this whole process, the Secretary of State listens, and is seen to listen, and does not simply shut out dissenting voices through the use of unforgiving deadlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07070542000302"></a>The Government have a bit of form on this. The date of publication of the White Paper setting out the broad basis of structural change&#151;omitting some detail, as we know&#151;and the 25 January deadline for the submission of bids strangled the consultation process. Indeed, the strangulation continues in the government amendments. Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 have, I fear, provoked great anxiety among councils. The effect of the amendments seems to be that the Government will assign to themselves the right not to consult the public&#151;in effect, they give the Government the means to make the decision on whatever grounds of consultation they might choose. I reiterate that the Bill and the Government&#146;s handling of it are in stark contrast to the message that the Government are sending out that they take into account the views of communities and seek to empower them through their proposals.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07070542000303"></a>We have received representations from a number of parties going through what is becoming a messy restructuring process. As the Minister knows, there is already a judicial review on consultation. I have no doubt that that will be heard before Report, so we will have the benefit of it after the Recess. One party told me that the consultation process so far has been nothing more and talking to 44 citizens&#151;presumably,

I am astonished that with these deep objections to the consultation procedures the Government are apparently seeking further to restrict communication between the Executive and the electorate. The electorate need to be involved in those decisions. This matters to them. After all, they are the people who are affected by any change to local government and it is paramount that they should be consulted properly.</p>

I want to take them through the argument for the government amendments, Amendments Nos. 27 and 29, and address the various amendments tabled alongside them.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07070542000305"></a>The whole group of amendments deals in various ways with processes of consultation. I am certainly happy to respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, by clarifying our intention in our amendments, which will not restrict consultation in any perverse way, but which will align the consultation processes of the Bill and the invitation. Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 are intended to ensure that the Secretary of State is required to consult those whose views she needs to know to fulfil her role in the restructuring process, but does not duplicate the extensive public consultations that councils themselves will be carrying out.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07070542000306"></a>Amendments Nos. 16, 28, 28A, 30, 31 and 52, which have been tabled by opposition Members of the Committee, are also intended to develop in more detail the consultation requirement. Amendment No. 20A would allow a council when responding to an invitation to make a proposal reflecting consultation with its electorate, as the noble Baroness said. Finally, Amendment No. 25 would modify the period for representations to be made about a unitary proposal which the Boundary Committee has made as an alternative to the proposal put forward by a local authority.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07070542000307"></a>I fully understand the motives that inspire the amendments, and I hope I can persuade the Committee that they are more than met by the restructuring processes that we are establishing. In brief, we are bringing our amendments forward to ensure that the Bill and the process which we have followed throughout the invitation to local authorities to come forward with plans for restructuring are fully aligned with each other and with the principles of devolution itself.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para25"></a>

<p><a name="07070542000698"></a>The significance of the change is, quite simply, to correct the drafting&#151;I have to hold my hands up to that need&#151;so that the clause does not mean that the Secretary of State herself is required to impose a form of central general consultation on local areas, at a later stage of deliberation, above and beyond that which has already been undertaken earlier in the process, rightly, by the local authorities concerned. The proposed changes are consistent with the  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1173"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intention and the process of restructuring by invitation, which has been welcomed by local authorities.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07070542000309"></a>Amendments Nos. 28 and 30 seek to restore the detail of the consultation requirement. They both use the same wording as in the present text of the Bill, which is inappropriate and redundant, because in any administrative process the Secretary of State must necessarily have regard to representations made to her by any person, whether or not she has consulted that person.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07070542000310"></a>I will address the process that we have already determined in the invitation. The whole process was to enable local authorities to decide whether to seek unitary status. One of the key tests for any such proposal was that it must have support from a range of key partners, stakeholders and service users or citizens&#151;the electorate. That was a deliberate form of words, because we wanted a formative process of consultation. We wanted people to be part of the process of deciding&#151;to ensure that the people most affected, such as the local partners and key agencies, could respond and contribute to the proposals, and that local authorities should seek the views of local people in whatever way was thought best. The key consultees, as they have emerged in the process and we have got to know, have been primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, police authorities, chambers of commerce, learning and skills councils, universities and so on. Within that notion of broad support is the principle that local authorities have got to show, in whatever way they think has been most effective, that they have involved local people. That is the most effective way to engage local people and to obtain well informed views of those affected.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07070542000311"></a>The variety of ways adopted by local councils in obtaining views is very interesting&#151;citizen juries, opinion polls, local referendums in some cases and citizens&#146; panels. I am not making relative judgments on which are effective. In North Yorkshire, for example, the county council commissioned a citizens&#146; panel survey&#151;2,500 people took part&#151;and three focus groups. Members and officers of the council attended approximately 250 parish and town council meetings. Three newsletters were sent out and there were 10 meetings with the VCS across the county. Key stakeholders, such as the chamber of commerce, received information through the LSP. The district council commissioned a MORI poll, directly communicated with the community&#151;for example, council tenants&#151;and contributed to newspaper articles. That is one example which is very typical of what has happened. I have other examples, but I will not go through them, unless noble Lords would like me to. When we come to the definition of &#147;person&#148; in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments, a person includes a body by means of the Interpretation Act 1978&#151;that means real people, but also organisations and companies.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07070542000312"></a>I have described what councils have done, some of which was before the proposals were submitted in January. It was in a way a pre-consultation process, which provided key evidence about how the proposals stacked up against the support criteria. Councils have  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done more, following the decision in March as to which proposals on the information that we had then met the criteria. Councils have done that to provide more evidence.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07070542000313"></a>The Secretary of State&#146;s consultation, which Clause 7 refers to and is the process in the current round of restructuring that ended on 22 June, had a very specific purpose. That purpose was to help her satisfy herself&#151;by seeking the views of those who are in a position to give an informed judgment&#151;that the evidence available showed that the proposals met the criteria. It was not a process for her to duplicate&#151;almost certainly less effectively&#151;what councils had already done in gathering evidence. Clause 7 provides for the consultation period&#151;ending on 22 June&#151;for the Secretary of State to satisfy herself that the proposals meet the criteria. As part of that, a consultation paper was issued and sent to stakeholders, inviting consultation responses. It was put on the website and was open for anyone to respond to. Gratifyingly, we had almost 60,000 responses; some were in the nature of campaigns, but many were individual responses. At this very moment the Secretary of State is, as it were, wading through the consultation responses, to see how people have responded.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07070542000314"></a>It is important to be clear because, although there would be some additional decision-making through popular referendums or suchlike, I want to stress that the amendments were never intended at this stage to impose from above on the local authorities some requirement for a universal public consultation. It is not intended by the Secretary of State to parachute in with a consultation that seeks to second guess the views and decisions of the democratic councils. The Bill recognises this, because it provides that when all councils are in agreement, no consultation is necessary, although the Secretary of State may if she wishes consult. In the last 12 weeks&#151;since we announced the 16 proposals&#151;the Secretary of State has been consulting with partners and stakeholders, considering the stakeholders&#146; consultation and then, at the end of July, she will make those decisions.</p>

<a name="70705-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07070542000315"></a>Amendment No. 16, the call for guidance, would contradict some of that process. It would remove the power of local authorities to decide for themselves. Amendment No. 20A does nothing that a council cannot and does not do already&#151;having regard to the electorate when making a proposal. Amendment No. 16, the notion of central guidance, is inimical to the spirit of the Bill. Amendment No. 20A would mean that the Secretary of State must consult every member of the electorate before implementing proposals. None of that is necessary or, indeed, compatible with the very thorough process that we put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07070542000316"></a>Before going back to my own amendments, I will turn briefly to Amendment No. 52, which also would require of the Secretary of State to take full account of representations made at any time prior to the commencement. We are doing that, and I hope that what I have said reassures noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07070542000317"></a>Let us turn back to the Government&#146;s amendments about why we have to correct the Bill. Discussions  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around judicial review also highlighted that the consultation provisions in the Bill are drawn too wide, by proposing a consultation process that involves any other person believed to have an interest. That would add nothing but delay to a process that we have tried to make as swift and precise as possible, but we need to make the change, because it is possible that a court would be likely to require such a wider consultation than is appropriate or necessary. That would require the department to impose a consultation aimed directly at every citizen, taxpayer, council tax payer, business, voluntary group and so on, or consultations through advertisements. We have placed our trust in local authorities and believe that that would duplicate what has been done.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07070542000318"></a>Finally, I come to the timescale for the Boundary Committee and Amendment No. 25. Let me make it clear that the four-week opportunity is at the end of a process that itself provides for sufficient consultation and engagement. I will explain. Where the Boundary Committee is minded to make an alternative proposal, it must publish a draft. That is the principal opportunity for people to comment&#151;it is provided through a requirement on the committee to ensure that those who have an interest are informed of the draft proposal and the deadline. As a matter of course, the Boundary Committee follows the Cabinet Office guidance on consulting for a minimum of 12 weeks. The Bill follows the precedent in the Local Government Act 1992 and allows the independent Boundary Committee to set a window for the receipt of recommendations that it considers appropriate; the Boundary Committee has then to take account of those representations.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07070542000319"></a>Where the Boundary Committee subsequently makes a proposal to the Secretary of State, we are providing a further opportunity&#151;an additional one&#151;hence the four weeks&#146; window. The Boundary Committee has to inform anyone who has made representations that it has made a proposal, and has to inform those people that they can go directly to the Secretary of State in that four-week period. Unless revised, that will be four weeks from the date set by the Secretary of State for advice from the committee. Those two processes should provide enough opportunity for people to make sufficient representation to ensure that their voices have been heard. I hope that noble Lords will be able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07070542000322"></a>The Minister said that there has not been a widespread referendum across all households because the Government have asked for options from councils. But I well remember, in the 1993-96 reorganisation, Professor Grant from the Local Government Commission coming down and having a meeting of all council leaders in my own county of Kent, and saying that he invited them to come forward with their preferred options for the county&#151;maybe pairs of district councils. Even in that organisation, councils came together and made proposals. Yet, in that reorganisation, the independent commission went out with a leaflet to every household. The importance of that was that everyone saw it to be independent and fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07070542000323"></a>It was not just one district council within a shire doing that; it was done within the whole area under review.

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07070542000325"></a>On what the noble Lord said, it is interesting that local authorities have taken many different routes to ascertain the views of their local people. I cited North Yorkshire, but Cornwall, for example, commissioned a MORI poll of over 1,000 residents. North Cornwall District Council sent a survey to 6,000 households. There has been a serious attempt by many local authorities to drill down into what local people feel about what is proposed.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07070542000326"></a>On this amendment, we have been debating the Secretary of State&#146;s role in Clause 7 and whether she should have any power to, as I have put it, parachute into the process and demand yet another review. That would undermine the integrity of what the local authorities have done at these early stages. Through the stakeholder consultation, the Secretary of State has been soliciting responses from individuals. We try really hard to collect the voices and ensure that the process has been genuinely informative so that stakeholders can have a role in the iterative process of making the proposal work. There is a big difference between the Boundary Commission making a proposal and one from a council which is democratically accountable, a point which the noble Baroness was making.</p>

<p><a name="07070542000699"></a>In discussions on this, the Minster has pointed to MORI polls, citizens&#146; juries and other odd ways of testing out a limited number of people&#146;s views. I know that MORI polls are meant to give you a pretty good idea of what the world believes, but the only way of finding out what people believe is to ask them. The only way of asking them is to ensure that everybody in the electorate is asked. There are many ways that local councils consult like this and ensure that they have touched every household, so that they can be sure that they have a response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07070542000328"></a>It may not seem to matter very much to many people how the district or county councils are formed and structured, but there are an awful lot of people to whom it matters. It changes the services, and changes who delivers them. It will cause havoc for the staff and the people administering social services. This is not just a paper reorganisation, but a major reorganisation of the whole of the services. Within this, the initial discussions before January were very limited. Where the councils were putting in their original applications after the invitation, there just was not time for there to be anything other than a skirmish of a consultation. Correspondence we have had from councils involved in the invitation authorities&#151;28 to begin with; it came down to 16 and now looks like being eight&#151;suggests that the consultation has not been widespread.</p>

What is important is how wide people throw that, and how wide the Secretary of State believes that she threw it. I still believe that each member of the electorate, in whatever area is being reformed, should be consulted. It is nothing but their right to be consulted. I hear what the Minister says.</p>

I raised a question on representations made following 22 June, but the debate has gone more widely than that. As I read the clause, whoever is consulted, under the Government&#146;s amendment that is not a restriction on those who may make representations and who will be heard. The Minister is nodding and shaking her head at the correct moments, so that is very helpful. I am not entirely sure of the solution to this. Whether the consultation undertaken at a local level is adequate, and whether the Secretary of State&#146;s role in checking the adequacy of this, may be issues which will come out in the wash in the applications going forward.

I remind the Minister what the now ex-Deputy Prime Minister said on introducing unitary authorities. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000779"></a>&#147;if you want to have a unitary, then you can have a ballot&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000702"></a>This Government claim that the Bill is devolutionary, but, as we have seen, it is only as devolutionary as a Secretary of State will allow it to be and is controlled quite heavily from Whitehall.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07070542000351"></a>Amendment No. 26 would guarantee that no community had any kind of structure of government forced on it without giving it an opportunity to vote on that. I accept that I am rather swimming upstream, but in trying to persuade a Government who willingly sign off fundamental British freedoms, we need to ensure that the people being affected have a right to add their views. Giving local electors the power to voice a preference represents a solid investment in the future of unitary councils, which is important. We, again, are getting mixed views on what happens when citizens&#146; juries take place and then another form of consultation takes place. The replies will be distorted and will not add up&#151;one consultation will go one way and another consultation will go another. It would be settled by a referendum, because that is a vote of the people, which is then binding by the majority. I urge the Government to take up this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment No. 26 seeks to materially change our process of restructuring by requiring that a unitary proposal cannot be implemented unless there has been a local referendum for support. The arguments that we have heard for referendums and for this new clause suggest that there is still some misunderstanding about the processes that we are seeking to establish for restructuring. The amendment talks of what happens if a referendum rejects the Secretary of State&#146;s proposals, but we need to be really clear that there is no question under the new processes of there being a proposal from the Secretary of State. Every proposal submitted comes from a democratically elected council, accountable to the local people, and that is the democratic process. It is right that local councils should be free to consult and engage in their communities in the way they believe is most appropriate. Some local authorities have already held a referendum, but it is not appropriate to impose one. Where a democratically elected council takes a decision, it should be validated in the normal way through a local election&#151;the most significant referendum of all. In our representative democracy, it is surely up to a democratically elected council to make a decision that the electorate can always contradict at the ballot box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07070542000353"></a>I recognise that in some areas different councils with their own mandate can reach opposing positions on restructuring, but seeking to resolve such differences between councils&#151;which, in any event, will have a different electorate&#151;is not the right way to

We should ask whose electorate would be participating in the referendum. As I have set out, the process which we are putting in place allows for councils in that position to provide evidence to the Secretary of State to support their case as part of the consultation process, and they will be tested on that. Crucially, any decision for structural change will ultimately be for Parliament to vote on through the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07070542000354"></a>I was not involved in previous attempts at restructuring but noble Lords may well have been. It is significant that in the Banham reviews of the 1990s there was no question of a referendum. The previous Administration created the approach that a proposal would be made by the commission they had appointed, and, if approved, it would be implemented. That contrasts with the bottom-up approach that we seek to adopt in the Bill. I accept that the Bill also provides that the Boundary Committee, having been asked for advice on a unitary proposal made by a council, can make its own alternative proposal. A referendum in such circumstances would in truth have been asking the local electorate to arbitrate between the views of its council and those of an independent expert committee. That is not a very sensible or practical way forward.</p>

<a name="70705-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07070542000355"></a>The right way to proceed is for decisions or recommendations from the independent Electoral Commission to be subject to debate by the democratically elected Members of this House and the other place. Our approach is devolutionary; it allows local authorities to come forward with proposals to demonstrate that the criterion has been met with a broad cross-section of support. Imposing referenda on local proposals would confuse, duplicate and disrupt. I am sure that is not what local authorities or noble Lords would want. I hope that the noble Baroness can withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07070542000373"></a>The noble Baroness said: This large group contains technical amendments on the processes for reviewing boundaries, structure or electoral arrangements as provided for in Part 1 of the Bill and the Local Government Act 1992. I will go through them as clearly as I can.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07070542000374"></a>The amendments to Clauses 8 and 10 simply ensure that when conducting a boundary review the Boundary Committee will be able to recommend that there be no change. As the Bill is drafted that would not be possible. If the committee thought that the existing boundary should be retained, it would simply not make any recommendation to the Secretary of State. The review procedure would have to come to a halt but without any public recognition that work had stopped or been completed. That is obviously not sensible. It is clearly desirable that the Boundary Committee, having decided that the boundaries should not be changed, formally completes the review process by making this recommendation to the Secretary of State. Those who have been involved in the review will then know that the Boundary Committee has reached that conclusion.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07070542000375"></a>The amendments to Clause 12 ensure that the Secretary of State is able to make provision in relation to parish electoral arrangements when she makes an order for structural or boundary change. The Bill already enables the Secretary of State to make changes to parish boundaries; in certain circumstances this will require a change to parish electoral arrangements. The amendment ensures that this is possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07070542000376"></a>The technical amendments to Clause 56 correct an error in the drafting of an amendment agreed to in another place. In an electoral review, the number of members is determined in relation to the ward they will represent, and the amendments reflect this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07070542000377"></a>The amendments to Clause 57 update Section 15 of the Local Government Act 1992, which sets out the procedure to be followed for an electoral review of wards or electoral divisions in a council&#146;s area.

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07070542000380"></a>The general tone of the Bill is to create more parish councils and to devolve power to local communities, but the amendments require the Secretary of State to agree to the number of parish councillors. It is suggested in other parts of the Bill that local authorities can create parish councils, so it is quite extraordinary that the number of parish councillors should then be decided by the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07070542000382"></a>We are trying to satisfy ourselves that changes fully reflect the intention of the Electoral Commission and the powers that be in local government. I would be grateful if the Minister could satisfy me that the views of the various bodies, which we all respect, have been taken fully into account. This is a sensitive area, and if we get off on the wrong footing there could be repercussions. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

There might have been an opportunity for us to discuss this, but it has somehow vanished. The concept of something being in the interests of effective and convenient local government is long-standing in legislation. Under the Local Government Act 1972, any boundary changes had to meet that test. It also underpinned the restructuring following the Banham reviews under the Local Government Act 1992. The concept has been understood in the context of a local authority&#146;s ability to deliver quality local services economically, efficiently and effectively, and to give local people a democratic voice in the decisions that affect them. The reason for including the words &#147;effective and convenient&#148; is to bring this long-understood concept into any decision on restructuring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07070542000392"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 35, 41, 53, 54, 61 and Liberal Democrat Amendment No. 42 are all of a piece. They would protect London boroughs from being involved in any of the shenanigans that are going on at the moment. Amendment No. 35 would insert a blanket exemption from all Boundary Committee reviews of London boroughs under the Bill, which would prevent any restructuring of London borough councils under the provisions that we are discussing today.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07070542000393"></a>Amendment No. 53 would reinforce the position by deleting the reference to London boroughs from the definition of local government areas. Amendment No. 41 would amend Clause 11, which provides for subsequent provisions to be included in an order to restructure. The amendment may go a little bit far, as it would prevent the establishment of county councils or district councils. It is similar to Liberal Democrat Amendment No. 42; we obviously have the same view in mind.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07070542000394"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness on the Liberal Democrat Benches will be able to support Amendment No. 54, which would prevent a unitary authority from being appointed in London. I believe that we already have what purports to be a unitary authority, which is the GLA. Noble Lords have had plenty of time to debate the various qualities of that institution in proceedings on another Bill. I had rather hoped that the overall effect of our amendments would extend to preventing London from having parishes. While I recognise the merits of parish councils outside London, where they play a very different role, I do not believe that London local government needs another tier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07070542000395"></a>There are several ways in which London could be affected by the Bill.

I share most of her concerns about London. I had thought that the boroughs were the unitary authorities, rather than the Greater London Authority, and I shall continue to claim that. I part company with her on parishes, because I believe that it is appropriate to have parishes in London if people want them. That is what the Liberal Democrats have said for a long time and it is the general thrust of this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07070542000397"></a>My Amendment No. 42 raises a general query. It is unclear to me&#151;I had better not include my noble friends in this, because they may have understood it perfectly&#151;how far this clause about the Boundary Committee is part of, and only part of, the proposals that are the subject of earlier clauses or whether it is a stand-alone arrangement. Unclear also is the extent to which this is required; in other words, is it not already within the Boundary Committee&#146;s powers to do the things that are set out in the clause? I became more puzzled as I read it. I read the provision as standing alone, but I hope that the Minister will explain what is new or additional.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07070542000398"></a>My amendment relates particularly to London. We need to understand whether London is potentially subject to the Bill, which I dare say would give rise to further amendments on Report. Debate about London has taken off in quite wild directions during the past two or three years, with proposals for what some people have termed &#147;super-boroughs&#148;, which might suit some, but certainly would not suit others. They would be very large combinations of five or six London boroughs. I hope that the Minister will help me to understand in general terms the place of this provision in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="07070542000399"></a><b><a name="70705-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070542000954"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This important group of amendments concerns London&#146;s relationship with the restructuring proposed in the Bill. It relates also to London in relation to the Boundary Committee.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07070542000400"></a>I shall address restructuring first. Last October&#146;s invitation to councils in England was issued to all councils outside Greater London and the metropolitan counties. There were evident reasons for excluding London boroughs from that process: first, London boroughs were already single tier; and, secondly, London has its own unique arrangements&#151;unitary London boroughs and the Greater London Authority. To have included London boroughs might well have raised some of the concerns at which noble Lords have been hinting; for example, the prospect that, following an invitation, a London borough might seek to merge with a district council outside London, thereby increasing the boundaries of the London boroughs. We did not believe that that outcome should be possible.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70705-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07070542000401"></a>However, the Boundary Committee is a different matter. The process of boundary revisions set out in the Bill is new, so I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we are starting with a blank sheet of paper. That is why it is important to include London. We need to be able to address potential boundary changes in London as a result of putting in place a permanent regime for adjusting the boundaries. London cannot be excluded from that, especially when we think of the predicted growth of London. Yet as noble Lords have said, Amendments Nos. 41, 42, 53, 54 and 61 would leave out London from the provisions of the boundary clauses and would effectively mean that there was simply no ability to make any changes to London boundaries. That would remove the discretion of the independent Boundary Committee in making recommendations, even in relation to sensible boundary adjustments.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07070542000402"></a>It is also important to add, as I do not need to remind the Committee, that we have only recently debated the Greater London Authority Bill&#151;in fact, we are still in the middle of it. If there are questions about the functional boundaries of London, other than minor boundary changes, these should be addressed through specific legislation designed for that purpose.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07070542000403"></a>Amendment No. 35 specifically seeks to prevent the London boroughs from amalgamating. Again, I hope to reassure noble Lords about the recommendations; some have expressed concern that the Boundary Committee might somehow be rather casual in its process of conducting a boundary review. I stress that the boundary review is robust and scrupulous. The Boundary Committee must have regard to the need to secure effective and convenient local government and it must reflect the identities and interests of local communities. It would reach the conclusion that a boundary review was the best solution only if it had gone through those robust processes. It is an independent committee and we ought not to try to restrict its recommendations.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07070542000404"></a>Amendment No. 41 would also appear to prevent the Secretary of State from establishing an authority for any local government area as a county council or a district council, and noble Lords have expressed concerns about the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to establish an area as a London borough. However, it is surely common sense to provide for the establishment of a London borough within Clause 11, given that the Boundary Committee is able to make a recommendation that, for example, two London boroughs should be amalgamated. Without that provision, we would not be able to establish an area as a London borough following the recommendation from the Boundary Committee&#151;should it make one&#151;that two London boroughs should be joined.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07070542000405"></a>On the issue of parishes, I am afraid that I can give the noble Baroness no satisfaction. Part 4 of the Bill obviously enables the creation of parishes in London, something that we support and put in our manifesto. It is good to have the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on that. I hope that I have answered most of the questions raised. I am certainly happy to write with further clarification if there are points of detail on how this might work.</p>

I am not sure what is being done differently in this Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07070542000407"></a>Perhaps I could make an observation that has just occurred to me and my noble friend Lady Hamwee. Part of the difficulty that we have been having over the last couple of hours is that, in the Bill, the question of local government structures&#151;the creation of unitary authorities&#151;has been mixed with that of boundaries. That has proved unhelpful for the debate, as we are often debating two separate issues. Cynics and conspiracy theorists&#151;of which I am, luckily, neither&#151;could have something of a field day wondering what the Government&#146;s future intentions might be. In this case, the Government have made a rod not just for their own backs but for the whole Committee.</p>

Clauses 4, 5, 6 and so on set out the new procedures about how the Secretary of State can request advice from the Boundary Committee on any matter relating to a proposal to allow the Secretary of State to gain independent advice. For example, Clause 7 relates to what the Secretary of State may do to implement the advice received.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07070542000409"></a>It is flying blind to compare the present proposals with the current procedures. I would like to set out graphically the present powers and purposes of the Boundary Committee and how they will change as a result of this, but none of the brief that I have here will do that very economically. However, I shall be happy to address the questions that have been raised about the amalgamation of London boroughs, as that was one of the noble Baroness&#146;s key points. I am always open to conversation between any stages of the Bill, as noble Lords know, but let us start by taking noble Lords through the process to see how it is comparable.</p>

First, London may think that it has unitary local government but, looking at London from outside and at the functions of the GLA, some of us think that it has two-tier local government. If the GLA is not a local authority, which legislation says that it is in some respects and not in others, nevertheless it certainly carries out a lot of functions that some of us would think were the functions of a local authority. That is an interesting point. If Londoners think that they have unitary authorities, they may be kidding themselves.</p>

If, as has been suggested, the London boroughs can be included in the invitations going out about unitary authorities, these clauses on the boundary change are related to the earlier clauses on the coming together of county councils and unitary authorities that have been given the invitation by the Minister. That is where I need the Minister&#146;s clarity. If not and the Boundary Committee is suddenly to be given carte blanche to deal with boundaries across the country rather than the ones with invitations, we are talking about something much wider than we have considered up to now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07070542000416"></a>I found it odd that the London boroughs were included under Clause 8 and that reference is made to them elsewhere. I understood that this part of the Bill was to be in association with what has to be done with authorities that are amalgamating or becoming unitary authorities under the previous clauses. The Minister did not quite say that and it would be helpful if we can have clarity on that today. If we cannot, it would be even more helpful to have it before the next stage. I think I am not the only one who is confused about it, because it looks as though we are talking about different things and it would be helpful to know what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="70705-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07070542000417"></a>I am concerned that London boroughs are scooped up by that provision. I had not understood that London boroughs were going to be part of the invitation or direction by the Secretary of State under this part of the Bill, which is why I sought to take it out. I would want to take it out anyway because, if London boroughs are even to be considered for amendments, that would become another Bill in itself and another discussion. I would not want that to be put on the back of the Bill and I think we need to know about that.</p>

If that is not right, there are a few amendments coming into my head that I would want to table. I do not follow the logic but, if that is what it is, we must get the Bill sorted out in a way that is really clear because Clause 4 is a request for the Boundary Committee for England&#146;s advice, which relates to all the provisions concerning Clauses 1 and 2 and the invitations. Then we have Clause 5, which is on the Boundary Committee&#146;s powers and whether those are general powers or ones associated with Chapter 2 of this part of the Bill and the Boundary Committee&#146;s procedures. Presumably, those are all listed somewhere else, so why did they pop up in the Bill? I see that the Boundary Committee must be involved where there are changes made to local authority boundaries, but in general that is not what these provisions are about. Somebody needs to re-sort all of it, because there will be problems when we arrive at Clauses 11, 12 and 13&#151;they are on all the residuary powers&#151;which is why I separated out those amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07070542000424"></a>Clause 8 is the crucial provision. Essentially, it allows the Boundary Committee to conduct a review of local government areas. A review can be instigated  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by a request from the Secretary of State or the local authority, or on the initiative of the Boundary Committee itself. I think that that covers the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Subsection (2) provides that the Boundary Committee may only make recommendations for boundary change that seem desirable to it, having regard to,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000781"></a>&#147;the need to secure effective and convenient local government&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000704"></a>That is consistent with the Boundary Committee&#146;s current approach. However, it can also recommend a boundary change, the abolition of a local government area and/or the constitution of a new local government area.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07070542000425"></a>The provision is in the Bill so that the Boundary Committee cannot make recommendations for boundary change that would permit structural change through the back door. It is therefore important that it is placed alongside the provisions that make those changes possible. The Boundary Committee cannot recommend the alteration of a local government area or the creation of a new local government area which would extend into Wales, the City of London or the Temples, for example. I hope that I have clarified that. </p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07070542000426"></a>Subsection (5) provides that the Boundary Committee must have regard to any guidance that the Secretary of State issues in connection with boundary review and that may include, for example, clarification of the legislative powers of the committee and what it can and cannot recommend where the guidance relates to a specific proposal, the economic coherence of the area or transport patterns. Subsection (6) provides that a local authority must provide information to the Boundary Committee which it requests in connection with this role, so that it has all the information it needs.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07070542000427"></a>That explains the geography of the Bill. It has two roles: to give advice on a unitary proposal, in Clauses 5 and 6, and the wholly separate role of making recommendations on boundary review, in Clauses 8, 9 and 10. I hope that that clarifies the unfortunate muddle.</p>

<ul>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07070542000449"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the light of previous discussion, I move this hesitatingly. We may be coming back to this as well. I rise to speak to Amendment No. 43 and oppose the Question that Clause 12 shall stand part of the Bill. Amendment No. 43, combined with the deletion of Clause 12, would erase the power of the Secretary of State to prescribe so-called &#147;electoral matters&#148; within an order under Clause 7 or Clause 10. Clause 7 applies to the restructuring that we are talking about in the first part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07070542000450"></a>As the Bill is currently drafted, the Secretary of State can prescribe the total number of members of any local authority, the number and boundaries of electoral areas for electing councillors, the number of councillors to be returned in an electoral area, the name of an electoral area, the order of retirement of councillors, the election of a mayor or executive, the appointment for a transitional period and the functions of a local authority.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07070542000451"></a>However, Clause 10(4)(c) in combination with Clause 12 gives the Secretary of State a completely free reign in an order made under Clauses 7 or 10. The resulting effect is that even if a council chooses to undergo a restructuring, the Secretary of State will decide to the last details, the terms of management.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07070542000452"></a>Reading these measures, I am baffled that the Government make the claim in the White Paper that they will empower local communities through this legislation. Try as I might, I cannot reconcile Whitehall powers reaching lower authorities&#151;and down to the names of electoral areas&#151;with the empowerment of those authorities. My honourable friend in another place mooted the possibility of a local area called Kellyshire&#151;that would be Blairshire now&#151;which I suppose has a certain ring to it. The point remains that the Secretary of State&#146;s stamp will be all over this local government.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07070542000453"></a>The Minister in the other place noted that Clause 12 translates powers from the 1992 Act. I did not notice him justifying the translation of powers with the different provisions and wider applications. While I appreciate that the Secretary of State may need powers to affect an overall change in the boundaries, I cannot agree with the Minister in another place that the name of a local government area, electoral matters and parish boundaries are simply consequential matters. Indeed, the Minister in another place, Phil Woolas, said that it was not the Government&#146;s desire that they should be held responsible for name changes.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07070542000454"></a>It seems only sensible to take the opportunity to debate this today and the opportunity to amend and improve the legislation, whether it was included in the 1992 legislation or not. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07070542000456"></a>Essentially, once decisions have been made to create a new local authority, we will seek, subject to parliamentary approval of the Bill, to make orders at the earliest opportunity. Clause 11, as described by the noble Baroness, ensures that all the necessary provisions can be included within the order. Being able to include provisions for electoral arrangements is essential. The implementation process of those arrangements is precisely what the amendment would undermine.</p>
<a name="time_17"></a>
<a name="70705-0010.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="07070542000803"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07070542000457"></a>Obviously, it is not possible to have an operational local authority without electoral arrangements. The Local Government Act 1992 already provides the Electoral Commission with necessary powers to establish the electoral arrangements of an authority. Where it is necessary, by reason of the scale of change, the Act can require the holding of a fresh election&#151;one outside the normal cycle for that type of authority. It is important that changes should be implemented quickly to minimise the potential for disruption. If it were possible for the Electoral Commission quickly to determine the electoral arrangements of the new authority, we would undoubtedly rely on the existing statutory provisions. But, depending on the number of individual changes to be made at any one time, it is realistic and possible that it will take 12 to 24 months for the Electoral Commission to put in place electoral arrangements for the new authorities. I am afraid that that would mean that the whole restructuring process, which, as I explained earlier, is extremely important for the benefit of local authorities to be as quick and as thorough as possible, would be extended. We have sought to avoid that from the outset.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07070542000458"></a>We need to be able to put in place, on a purely transitional basis, arrangements for the new authorities to tide them over until the Electoral Commission is able to complete a proper review. Following an implementation order being made, the Electoral Commission will be under a duty to consider whether or not an electoral review should be conducted to create new electoral arrangements for the new authority under Clause 12(5).</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07070542000459"></a>In summary, once a local authority has submitted a proposal and the Secretary of State has decided to implement it, we need to minimise disruption by establishing the new authority as soon as possible, and any electoral arrangements made under Clauses 11 and 12 would effectively be transitional, pending consideration of an electoral review by the independent Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07070542000460"></a>Clauses 12, and with it Clause 11 empower the Secretary of State to make provision for the transitional arrangements, and the powers are deliberately wide-ranging to enable us have an approach to implementation that provides the greatest local flexibility. We do not want, and cannot  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1193"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have, a one-size-fits-all situation; therefore, we aim to tailor the implementation arrangements to suit local circumstances. Clauses 12 and 11 will enable local authorities to make the change from two-tier to unitary structures in ways that are most effective for them, and to choose the transitional arrangements best suited to them.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07070542000461"></a>We have already started a dialogue on those transitional arrangements with the LGA, individual councils and other stakeholders, including the public-sector unions. They are part of the working groups that we have set up to discuss implementation. I am pleased to say that there is widespread agreement on the approach that we propose to adopt. We will continue to work out the details with the help of those working groups following the announcement of the proposals on how we proceed towards implementation, because there are different ways that transitional arrangements can be set up.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07070542000462"></a>These clauses essentially provide local authorities with means to implement unitary structures with the least disruption and allow them to make the passage into new ways of working. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

I am sure that other noble Lords will agree that the creation of a new local authority is no small matter and bringing together a number of district councils and a county council will inevitably be the result of at least one or more of the proposals on offer. It is a pretty big deal and it will take quite a long time to sort out staffing arrangements, the disposal of assets and so on. I am rather surprised that the Government take the view that that can be achieved more quickly than the commission takes to sort out the electoral arrangements. I am slightly surprised that the two cannot work in tandem, and I would appreciate some briefing on how the Government see the timetable moving forward.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07070542000464"></a>While I agree with the noble Baroness that I would not wish to see progress held up while the electoral arrangements are sorted out, if it were possible for the general preparations and the electoral ones to move together in tandem, that would be much better&#151;not least because people who live in a locality will have to get used to the fact that their council arrangements are changing radically. Then to have electoral arrangements that applied for one time only and then to have to move to another arrangement would add a degree of confusion. I do not wish to press this matter too hard now, but I would like to understand a bit more about how the Government see that moving forward.</p>

My experience of amalgamation comes from the London Government Act 1963, which shows my age. It was enacted in such a way that in the first elections for London boroughs, Enfield, Edmonton and Southgate came together, with elections taking place in 1964. The definitive date of operation was  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1194"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>1965, so for 12 months each of the councillors of those three former boroughs carried on their work as an Edmonton or, in my case, an Enfield councillor, while also meeting regularly for consultation, putting flesh on the bones and making appointments.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07070542000466"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right: it is a very traumatic&#151;I will not say horrendous&#151;period, especially for the officers of the amalgamated authorities. After all, they were, in northern terms, &#147;kings of the midden&#148; in their localities. Now they had to fight, and then take a judgment before their internal fight, as to whether they were better off having a go at somebody else. I vividly remember that good people, whom I would have hoped were employed by the London borough of Enfield, disappeared because they saw a better opportunity. Because they were good, they did not take a risk and moved somewhere safe, rather than fight it out.</p>

<a name="70705-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07070542000467"></a>The Minister could do the House, and local government generally, a service by putting flesh on the bones of this proposal. Enfield was unique. Before the amalgamation, the political complexion of Edmonton was fairly solidly Labour, and that of Southgate was absolutely Conservative, with Enfield in the middle. After the election, with 60 seats contested, the result was 31 to 29. Of course, we put the others out of their misery by taking over 10 aldermanic seats, which eased the position. It was to our regret, of course, because in the first election after 1964, in 1968, the complexion changed from 31 to 29 to 51 to 9. You might say that that would teach me a lesson. It certainly has: be a little more generous next time around in case I am the one who needs assistance.</p>

I am happy to provide some account of how we think the different transitional models will work. Clearly, electoral arrangements need to be in place early in the implementation process, so that there can be an election to the shadow authority. That will be responsible for carrying out much of the implementation, so these must be aligned and the shadow authority, the transition body, will be established shortly after we have made the order to create the new authority. There are different ways in which local authorities will want to do this. I would be happy to talk or write to the noble Baroness in order to set that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07070542000479"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are making a huge leap forward to Clause 12. Amendments Nos. 47 and 49 follow on from the previous debate, in that they relate to the governance arrangements that will emerge for the councils which come out of reorganisation either as shadow authorities or as wholly new councils. The amendments have been tabled to seek clarification from the Government about their intentions for the executive structures of the new bodies. It appears to us that under the Bill, it is for the Secretary of State to decide on the model of the executive of the new council. Can she confirm that?</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07070542000480"></a>It is also not clear how it will be decided which model of governance is deemed to be suitable. A new unitary council could be brought out of councils that previously had a variety of governance arrangements&#151;they may have had a leader or a mayor, or a small authority may have kept the old committee system. The amendments have been tabled to seek clarification from the Minister about whether the Secretary of State will decide and what criteria will be used to determine the model of governance to be used in future. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07070542000481"></a><b><a name="70705-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07070542000989"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Before I address that question, I will briefly say something for the record about the effects of the amendments. They would have the serious consequence of preventing the Secretary of State from ensuring that new authorities can begin operating at the earliest opportunity after decisions have been made by preventing the election of key officers. I am sure that the noble Baroness would not want that.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07070542000482"></a>For a local authority to begin operating, obviously it needs its councillors in place. Clause 12(1)(j) allows the Secretary of State to appoint existing councillors to the new authority with a democratic mandate provided by their election from the ward or division of an existing authority. Clause 12 also makes clear that those appointments are only for a transitional period until elections can be held. Following the order that will bring the new authority into being, the Electoral Commission will be under a duty to consider whether an electoral review should be conducted to require new electoral arrangements for a new authority. That is in Clause 12(5).</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1196"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70705-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07070542000483"></a>Amendment No. 49 also removes the Secretary of State's power to provide within the order for the executive arrangements for the authority, which brings us to some of the questions raised by the noble Baroness. The amendment proposes that the executive arrangements for new authorities should be carried over from existing authorities, but that is hardly sensible when we are looking to a fresh start for a new local authority. It is much more desirable, not to say democratic, for the local authority that is proposing the creation of a new authority also to propose the executive arrangements.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07070542000484"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness is looking forward enormously, as I am, to Part 3. We will then have the opportunity to discuss the nature of leadership, its scope and the models that have been proposed. I do not want to anticipate that debate, but essentially, on the basis of evidence and common sense and given the growing responsibility of local authorities for place making, what people want in order to engage with local government is a leader who is visible and clearly accountable and a local council with a clear set of responsibilities. We have set out a range of models from which local authorities can choose. We have done so deliberately, because what they have in common is all being built around notions of strong leadership, strong executive powers and stability within a four-year term. We are not imposing the model: there is a limited choice of models and we will be debating when we come to Part 3 of the Bill.</p>

I would not want to pre-empt the excitement in Part 3 next week. The general approach of the Government seems to be the old Henry Ford approach: you can have any model you like so long as it is black. In the case of the arrangements, you can have any model you like so long as it is a mayor or a strong leader. We have that joy to come.</p>

I do not want to start talking about leadership models at this stage, even though the Minister tempted us to do so, because we will be having some exciting discussions about that next week, I hope.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07070542000487"></a>I have three points. First, the Government have got themselves into a mess over the question of the electoral arrangements for the new authorities, because the electoral arrangements depend on the leadership model that is chosen and so have to be decided before the authority is elected. There is a democratic paradox here: the people getting elected to the authority might have strong views about which model they want, but they will not be able to campaign on that&#151;to get elected or not elected on that basis&#151;because the decision will already have been made. For example, if people do not want a mayor but it has been decided to have a mayor, they will be lumbered with one whether they like it or not. My question is whether the time limit on changing from one set of executive arrangements to another set  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1197"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of executive arrangements&#151;somewhere else in the Bill&#151;applies to the new authority. Will a new authority, once elected, be able to change its executive arrangements within its first period of office? That would seem to be the best possible democratic compromise under what is a fairly unsatisfactory situation. That is my first question.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07070542000488"></a>Secondly&#151;actually, I think that I have four questions&#151;if a new unitary authority is to be elected as a result of the invitations being sent out and the decisions currently being made, how will the decision be made about which executive model is to be chosen? Will it be on the basis of the bid that has been made and what the authority or authorities putting forward the unitary authority proposal have said that they would like? As I understand it, at least some of them have set out in great deal the models of government and so on, because they have to do it. Alternatively, will the Secretary of State say, &#147;No, you want this system, but you are not going to have it. Sorry, you are going to have something different&#148;? That is my second question: is there a presumption that it will be on the basis of the bids being put in?</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07070542000489"></a>Thirdly, the Minister was concerned about the amendment removing Clause 12(1)(j), which is about,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000782"></a>&#147;the appointment by the Secretary of State of existing councillors to be members of a new local authority for a transitional period&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000705"></a>That is not, in my understanding, what the Government have been telling local authorities will happen. They have been saying that decisions will be made by November this year, that the proposals for which ones can go forward from whatever phase we are in at the moment will be made at the end of July and that the affirmative instruments for creating the new authorities will go through Parliament in November with elections next May. The new authorities will then come into being straightaway and take over after a transitional 12 months. That is my understanding.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07070542000490"></a>In that situation, I do not understand during which period appointed councillors will be needed. If there are to be appointed councillors in, for example, a unitary authority such as Shropshire, to pick one at random&#151;where there are five districts and the proposals are to double the size of the county council to around 90, which would still be less than half the number of councillors currently on the district and county councils&#151;who is going to choose which of those councillors should be appointed? Who is going to look at those councils? Is the Secretary of State going to say, &#147;Ah, we&#146;ve got Shrewsbury Council; I&#146;ll have these people, but I won&#146;t have those people&#148;? This seems an anomalous process. Can the Minister explain what this business of appointed councils is all about, under what circumstances it would be necessary and how on Earth the Secretary of State would choose which ones were worthy of being on the new authority and which were to be said goodbye to?</p>

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="07070542000491"></a><b><a name="70705-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070542000992"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The noble Lord has asked some quite detailed questions about the process. It is worth saying that he is right that all the proposals currently being considered contained proposals for the  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1198"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>executive arrangements. The invitation that we issued in October last year specifically required proposals for new unitaries to include proposals for new leadership models. It is therefore obviously right that local authorities can put forward proposals rather than inheriting a leadership model from a previous council. That will answer the noble Lord&#146;s second point.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07070542000492"></a>The order setting up the new authority will specify the form of the executive. If that is subsequently changed and the council has a change of heart, the Part 3 provisions will apply. The authority would have to go through the process set out in Part 3 for when a council subsequently decides to change its arrangements. That is just part of the natural process. </p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07070542000493"></a>The noble Lord is right about the timetable. It will roll out through May next year, with the councils coming into force in May 2009. The councillors appointed for the transitional period will be put in place between the coming into force of the order and the subsequent elections in May. I do not know the answer to the noble Lord&#146;s questions about the specific detail of those processes, so I will have to write to him about how that will be done. These things and, naturally enough, their implementation are being discussed now. I talked earlier about conversations that have been held with the Local Government Association and so on about transitional arrangements. These are the sorts of things that will be discussed.</p>

I am not sure what it would do. Would it be set up with executive arrangements? Would it have a leader? Would there be all appointed councillors? This seems a totally unnecessary process.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07070542000495"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, recounted his experiences from 1963. I am glad that I cannot go back that far, but I remember the 1972 local government reorganisation when I was a member of Colne Borough Council, which was one of seven authorities coming together to form the new Pendle Borough Council. It was really quite complicated. After the passing of the 1972 Act and the elections for the new council in June 1973, perfectly adequate arrangements were in place. A committee of representatives from each of the existing councils was set up, which met to plan whatever sensible things needed to be planned. These things were not huge, but they had to be discussed at the time.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07070542000496"></a>Between June 1973 and 1 April 1974, when the new authority took over, a new council was put in place, and there were 11 months in which to do it. This time there will be 12 months. All the important decisions that need to be made can be made during those 12 months. The idea of an appointed transitional council is an over-complication, which will cause real problems. The Government would be well advised to drop this and to think seriously about simply having a sensible meeting of representatives from the councils coming together.</p>

Essentially, we need to ensure that in the transition period a body of councillors is charged with overseeing the preparatory work. This clause allows us to make use of an existing body of councillors or to elect or appoint a body of councillors specifically to take over the necessary preparations. When I write to the noble Baroness with the details, we will set out some of those considerations. It is important to build in flexibility to ensure that individual circumstances are tailored to each locality. This approach has been welcomed by local government and by the stakeholders, because clearly it is a pragmatic process, which we hope will work. In the period ahead of the first elections to a shadow authority, the order setting up the new authority could, for example, empower the Secretary of State to appoint the leaders of each of the old authorities. Clearly, a number of different things could be done.</p>

If possible, when the Minister writes it would be very helpful to have some of the information in the form of a flow chart that one could follow through to see what steps will be taken at any given time. Perhaps I may add a comment to that request. Some of the answers that the Minister gave to my noble friend were in terms of the current invitations in the current round, but there may be broader issues than can be answered just by using the immediate examples.</p>

So under Clauses 14 and 15&#151;we can discuss Clauses 16 and 17 separately but they are about the same thing&#151;how can we establish what has been done in the name of Clause 7 and what has been done in the name of Clause 10? Clause 10 is a wider and less dated clause but, under Clauses 14 and 15, the processes could start at any time for any of the authorities being considered. In light of the way this legislation is going, they have probably started already. Could the Minister give an overview on Clauses 14 and 15?</p>

These include such things as, in Clause 15(1)(d), the transfer of staff compensation for loss of office. I have the greatest admiration for people who work in local government across the country. They are immensely professional, work very hard, are of great integrity and have a real commitment to public service.

As the noble Baroness knows, local government already has issues of recruitment and retention. There are issues of whether we can retain people against the private sector and against the rest of the public sector&#151;local government retires at 65, and the rest of the public sector retires at 60. Certainly in previous reorganisations, the arrangements were such that staff had to be made redundant from one authority before transferring to another. The terms attached to that were extremely generous and the transfer arrangements did not always work out in the best interests of council tax payers. We need absolute clarity on this issue and I come back to my main point: why is this issue here when we already have standard conditions across the country? Are conditions going to be more generous? Are they going to be less generous? How is it going to work?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07070542000513"></a>Essentially, Clause 14&#151;&#147;Regulations for supplementing orders&#148;&#151;is a technical clause which allows the Secretary of State to make provision by regulations for incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary purposes as a consequence of an order under Clauses 7 or 10 for structural and/or boundary change. Such provisions may include those outlined in Clause 15&#151;I shall come to those in a minute. However, although it is a technical matter, the Secretary of State will provide in the individual restructuring orders for matters specific to each area&#151;for example, the number of councillors.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07070542000514"></a>This power to make regulations will be used to make overarching regulations which are applicable to all structured areas as well, and may deal with common matters. This might involve, for example, general modifications needed to primary legislation regarding financial matters and so on. So there are two types of potential regulations. Essentially, all that Clause 14 does is enable the making of those kinds of regulations.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07070542000515"></a>While Clauses 13 and 14 allow the Secretary of State to make those incidental and consequential regulations, Clause 15 outlines what those provisions may include. They may include provision for the transfer of function, property rights or liabilities from a local authority or police authority for any area to another local authority or police authority whose area consists of or includes the whole or a part of the area. They also make arrangements for the transfer of staff, compensation for loss of office, pensions and other staffing matters. Obviously I do not need to tell the noble Lord that these provisions are essential to enable the transfer of functions and responsibilities from an old authority that will be dissolved under an order to the new authority. As the noble Lord said, it is important for that transition to be as smooth and with as little disruption as possible.</p>

<a name="70705-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07070542000516"></a>What terms and conditions will apply to staff transferring is a matter on which discussions are being started with the LGA, the trade unions and other parties. No decisions have yet been taken but this clearly will develop in the course of the conversations that will be had, especially after the end of this month. I shall certainly keep the noble Lord informed about that. Once decisions are taken, they will be reflected in the orders and regulations under the Bill. The process will be transparent and follow the normal practice. That will happen once the Bill is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07070542000517"></a>Clause 15(2) provides that an order or regulation related to structural or boundary change,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000783"></a>&#147;may for any incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary purpose ... modify, exclude or apply ... any enactment ... repeal or revoke any enactment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000706"></a>In plain English, that means that the law can be adapted to fit the new authorities; for example, by amending the membership of police authorities. The clause provides examples of provision that can be made as a part or a consequence of the order. I hope that helps the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07070542000518"></a>Perhaps I may say a few words about the amendments. Amendment No. 50 seeks to amend Clause 16, which enables public bodies to make agreements with respect to incidental measures. It will  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1202"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be necessary for public bodies to make more than one agreement. The precedent &#147;from time to time&#148;&#151;which I think is the issue raised in the amendment&#151;is set out in the Local Government Act 1992 so, again, it is a concept of practice which is well known. I hope that will reassure noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07070542000519"></a>Amendment No. 51 seeks to amend Clause 18, which provides for the establishment of staff commissions to facilitate the staffing arrangements in new local authorities. We have no intention or plans to establish new staff commissions, but the Bill allows the Secretary of State to give directions to any relevant authority affected by an order in respect of the payment of any expenses incurred by a staff commission in doing anything requested by the authority. Where expenses are not recovered from a relevant local authority, Clause 12 provides that these can be paid by the Secretary of State out of money provided by Parliament. It is a common-sense measure. Again, we have taken that precedent from the Local Government Act 1992, which allows staff commissions to be funded.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07070542000520"></a>These provisions allow us to implement structural boundary changes in a way that follows long-established procedures. I am sure that noble Lords would not want to press their amendments as they would essentially undermine those procedures. I hope that with that explanation&#151;</p>

Say two authorities are being merged. If one is a continuing authority, its staff do not have to be made redundant, which can make a continuing saving. But it could add certain core staff. Has consideration been given to that issue?</p>

I have just one more question for the Minister. Local authorities have been changing and coming together and there have been reorganisations for many years. Do the provisions in this Bill appear in any other legislation as they are here, or are these changes to other legislation? I am not clear why they pop up under Clauses 7 or 10. In Clause 7, they are prevailing for the authorities that are about to come together. Are these provisions not laid out in other Local Government Acts? Are they completely new? If they are completely new, we ought to treat them with a great deal of detail because they have substantial powers of sorting out the liabilities, functions, property ownership, transfer of property, rights or liabilities. There is an enormous amount of function in here and they are clearly transitional arrangements. I wonder why they need to appear here. Perhaps they need to appear under an indication that they are part of another Act.</p>

It is important that we have this sort of thing on the face of the Bill so that we can discuss it.

I am not quite clear why &#147;from time to time&#148; appears. I imagine that these are, by and large, transitional arrangements that would be made&#151;full stop.

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07070542000542"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 20 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="07070542000543"></a><b><a name="70705-0012.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070542001010"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> The clause suggests that the Secretary of State can make any corrections to an order. Does that apply just to a misprint, or to the wrong council, the wrong authority or the wrong date? How big a change can be made under the clause?</p>

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="07070542000544"></a><b><a name="70705-0012.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070542001011"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I suppose that it is relative. The clause allows the Secretary of State to rectify a mistake in any order made under the chapter; for example, an order making a structural and/or boundary change, or an order containing incidental or consequential provision. If the original order contained a mistake&#151;for example, an omission or incomplete information supplied by a local authority&#151;the Secretary of State may correct it. Subsection (2) makes it clear that a &#147;mistake&#148; includes,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000784"></a>&#147;a provision contained in or omitted from the order in reliance on inaccurate or incomplete information supplied by any public body&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70705-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07070542000545"></a>Where the Secretary of State makes an order under the provisions of this chapter, provisions of that order may take effect on the coming into force of the order and therefore, having taken effect, be spent. Were there to be an error or omission in one of the spent provisions of the order, the Secretary of State would be unable to address it through the normal provisions in the Interpretation Act 1978, which allow the Secretary of State certain powers to amend orders previously made. For example, if the order&#146;s consequential provisions inadvertently included or omitted a parish council, which would be a serious omission, and we could not address it using the powers of the Interpretation Act 1978, we would use the powers in this clause to correct it.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07070542000546"></a>I assure the Committee that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to use the clause to change the order and depart from it, which would be a misuse. This is a common-sense provision, because we all know that errors or omissions are inevitable when orders are made within a tight time scale. There is a precedent for this. The previous Administration took similar powers under Section 26(6) of the Local Government Act 1992. The clause is a safeguard measure. I hope that noble Lords will be content with that explanation.</p>

The reality is that if the Secretary of State is not acting against the law, she is certainly not within the law, as the law does not exist. We are taking legislation through Parliament simply to justify actions that she is already undertaking.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07070542000553"></a>There is nothing to stop the Secretary of State from amending this Bill as she goes along to best fit the law to her purposes. Earlier government amendments seem to do just that, narrowing the consultation process. I cannot see why the Government have chosen to include this part of the Bill, given that the Secretary of State is simply going on with the plans regardless. This part of the Bill is simply an exercise in formality; it is little more than a withdrawal from parliamentary proceedings to expect both Houses merely to rubber-stamp practices that are going on elsewhere. In a sense, we can guarantee that anything we have debated in Committee today will not be taken away and looked at, because the Secretary of State is already operating under these draft criteria that have not been agreed.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07070542000554"></a>As I said at the outset, we are debating this legislation with our hands tied behind our back. I do not know why the Government have decided to legislate in this way, much as I cannot see why your Lordships are expected to sanction it. Nevertheless, it is important that the Minister clarifies Clause 21. I would be grateful if, in doing so, she could say what steps would be taken if the Secretary of State were, for example, to name a local authority, only to have the power to do so removed from this Bill. This is quite plainly retrospective legislation, even though the Minister has said that it comes within powers already in the Secretary of State&#146;s hands. I am prepared to hear the Government&#146;s case, but I feel uneasy about how this has been presented. Clause 21 does not make me feel any better.</p>

It just provides that if, before the commencement of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Bill&#151;provisions that relate to structural and boundary change&#151;the Secretary of State issues an invitation, or guidance, or receives or consults on proposals received, she can implement such proposals after commencement of this part.</p>

<a name="70705-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07070542000556"></a>This clause will simply allow us to implement the proposals received in response to the invitation that we issued last October, and which we judge as meeting the criteria to proceed towards implementation. In our second debate today, I went to some pains to assure the noble Baroness that there was nothing retrospective about this clause. It in no way validates or seeks to make lawful things that, before the Bill&#146;s enactment, were not valid or lawful.

It has to be done quickly to minimise the period of uncertainty in any area, or periods when there is sharp contention and debate about the best way forward. It is pragmatic in minimising the scope for potential disruption to local services and effective local leadership. Again, Clause 21 enables us to keep as short as possible the process of restructuring while getting it right.</p>

This is a group of probing amendments that will, I hope, allow us to clarify the function of these clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07070542000568"></a>Clauses 24, 25, and 26 provide for the transitional arrangements between councils, which I am sure are all well in order. However, I have a few concerns about the thresholds established in Clause 24. The clause allows the Secretary of State to direct that an authority may dispose of land if it is worth less than &#163;100,000, enter into a capital contract which is worth less than &#163;1 million or enter into a non-capital contract worth less than &#163;100,000. The clause is expressed in negative terms so the Secretary of State can direct a relevant authority not to enter into such contracts above those thresholds&#151;but these are simply two sides to the same coin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07070542000570"></a>Clauses 25 and 26 are consequential on Clause 24 and, if that clause can be shown to be in order, I would be content not to press the Questions whether they should stand part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07070542000571"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 go hand in hand; they perform a double function. First, they would uphold the principle in our earlier debate that activity under the legislation should not anticipate its passage by the House. Secondly, it would provide local authorities and those taking out contracts with a little more flexibility in the negotiating process. It has been pointed out that decision-making froze in the 26 local authorities that tabled bids. Nobody knows which bids will be accepted and, in the interim, local authorities are in a hiatus. Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would simply allow local authorities flexibility to make their own decisions in the coming months while giving them the certainty that if their bids are not to be accepted they may simply continue as before. Those amendments also prevent this law applying retrospectively to any contracts or investments that authorities may have made.</p>

I am sure that noble Lords opposite are not prepared to see council tax payers burdened by irresponsible decisions of councils that are to be abolished through restructuring, which is what the clause attempts to prevent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07070542000574"></a>We would all like to think that there would be no such councils. The idea is that everyone involved in restructuring would work together to ensure that change is smooth and efficient and that all decisions fully safeguard the position of those who will be responsible in future for delivering services and leading local communities.

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07070542000707"></a>I agree that these clauses, which restrict what councils can do in certain circumstances, are not devolutionary, but sadly I believe they are necessary if our greater devolutionary aim of allowing councils to seek unitary structures is to enable them to deliver in full the benefits to council tax payers and service users. It would be reckless to think they were not necessary and to try to remove them, because sadly there are many examples from previous rounds of restructuring where authorities to be dissolved acted irresponsibly over

The clauses would safeguard against that. Their purpose is simply to ensure that councils that are to be dissolved do not dispose of valuable lands, enter into long-term contracts or apply financial reserves to reduce council tax above a limit that may be specified by the Secretary of State. All those things would have a negative effect on any new authority.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07070542000575"></a>These clauses do not mean that an outgoing authority has to cease business. The Secretary of State, or the other person specified in the direction as being the person to give consent, may consent to a disposal, to the authority entering into the contract or to the use of reserves. The Secretary of State may specify that consent should be sought from the new authority if, for example, it has already been established as a shadow authority. These clauses do not seek to remove the discretion of local authorities to spend a reasonable amount of reserves to reduce their budget requirement for council tax purposes or any other reason. However, allowing the Secretary of State to restrict the amount of reserves an authority includes in its calculation of its budget requirement, even for the purpose of reducing council tax, is essential to prevent the situation I described.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07070542000576"></a>Amendment No. 58 would open the door to a council using reserves with the following possible effects: reserves that may otherwise have been available to the new authority might no longer be available; it might artificially lower council tax in the area, making it harder for the new authority to equalise council tax across the area as a whole. Those actions potentially undermine a new authority&#146;s financial position both in the cost of restructuring and in the future as it looks to equalise services and service provision. Lastly, an undue use of reserves in a given year places further pressure on the Government&#146;s fiscal rules, as it adversely affects the fiscal aggregate in a given year by increasing spending but not receipts.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07070542000577"></a>This is not about the Government being dictatorial and restricting what authorities can do; it is about prudence and ensuring the financial viability of the new unitary authorities. Therefore, the provisions should remain part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07070542000578"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would amend &#147;31 December 2006&#148; in Clause 27 to &#147;the commencement date of this Part&#148;. That would seriously weaken the safeguards against irresponsible decisions. The inclusion of &#147;31 December 2006&#148; means that the value of disposals or any contracts entered into from that date by authorities that are to be abolished count for the purposes of the direction issued under Clause 24. Clause 24 allows the Secretary of State to require an authority that is going to be dissolved to obtain consent before it can dispose of land over &#163;100,000, enter into certain contracts or include an amount of financial reserves when calculating its budget requirement for council tax purposes. In effect, the clause would mean that, for example, if an authority disposed of land worth &#163;60,000 on 2 January 2007, once subject to a direction under Clause 24, if it sought to dispose of a further piece of land worth   


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1209"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;50,000 after the date of the direction, it would need to seek consent for that further disposal because it will count: the value of both transactions is &#163;110,000, which is over the &#163;100,000 limit. So alteration of the date would mean that councils that are to be abolished would be free to make disposals or enter into contracts until the commencement of the provisions in Clause 24 without any subsequent consequences as to what they could do once the Bill had been implemented. That would obviously weaken the safeguards.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07070542000579"></a>The noble Baroness asked what would happen if a local authority entered into a contract without consent. I am told that if an outgoing local authority which was subject to a direction entered into a contract without consent, the contract would not be enforceable against the successor authority. Clause 28(2) provides for that.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07070542000580"></a>These are technical issues, but they provide further safeguards in what could be an unfortunate process. I think that they are necessary and I hope the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In moving Amendment No. 62, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 73 and 84. They are all the same amendment but relate to different circumstances.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07070542000598"></a>I have tabled a number of related groups of amendments, all of which seek to free up the ability of local authorities and councils to decide their own electoral arrangements without undue imposition from the centre. As for electoral arrangements, there clearly has to be quite a lot of controlled supervision of local authorities, more than in many other areas. By the very nature of elections, if authorities are simply allowed to do what they want and how they want in any circumstances, some might behave in somewhat undesirable ways in order to preserve the election and office of those who are there at the moment. I accept that there have to be detailed rules and regulations about elections and safeguards laid down, but many of the restrictions that the Government are proposing, and which already exist in many cases, are too great.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07070542000599"></a>The first amendment is a fairly straightforward, simple one. It says that once a scheme for a particular election&#151;whether it is whole council, by halves or by thirds&#151;has been approved, it will not be changed until there have been two subsequent elections, which seems a reasonable time period. I think that is what the Government are saying in their more complicated elections that refer to particular dates and all the rest of it. If that is what they are saying, they should say it in a nice simple way, which is what I have offered them here. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, could clarify whether he was trying to insist that they had to wait two cycles? If they were to be left to their own arrangements and wanted to have an all-out election fairly rapidly, they should be allowed to do so. I was not quite clear when he was moving his amendment whether we should support it. He almost seemed to be prescribing one fixed system, when we all thought that we should allow a local council to decide for itself what it was going to do.</p>

The Government are opposed to Amendments Nos. 62, 73 and 84. District councils that are eligible to change their electoral cycles should not be placed under too many restrictions as to when a resolution may be passed.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07070542000604"></a>When devolving responsibilities to local authorities, we must be prepared to trust them to act responsibly. Preventing a local authority from changing its electoral cycle within eight years of a previous decision to change is too restrictive. The Bill provides for a council to resolve to change its scheme for elections at shorter intervals. It would be up to district councils to decide whether it is sensible to change their scheme after only four years. As set out in the White Paper and as recommended by the Electoral Commission in its January 2004 report, the Government believe that whole-council elections are the most appropriate scheme for an authority to operate.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07070542000605"></a>Our main concern is that the restrictions within the amendments tabled may prevent councils moving to whole-council elections in the first place as they will be stuck on that cycle for eight years. Therefore, they may not be prepared to change their scheme of elections in the first place. The amendment is overly restrictive and will discourage councils from changing to whole-elections. I hope that at this stage the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07070542000613"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak to the other amendments in the group, all of which repeat two amendments applied to three different circumstances.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07070542000614"></a>I propose that there should be adequate consultation before a local authority takes a decision to change electoral arrangements. The Government are proposing that the council should have,</p>
<ul><a name="07070542000785"></a>&#147;taken reasonable steps to consult such persons as it thinks appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070542000708"></a>I want to make absolutely certain that local electors are among those consulted. Secondly, I propose that the minimum requirement for consultation of local electors and others is a notice in at least one local newspaper and a notice on the council&#146;s website.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07070542000615"></a>These are important matters. The Government may say, &#147;Well, they will do that anyway, won&#146;t they?&#148;, and a good, sensible council would take those steps. However, again this comes back to the point that changing electoral systems is a sensitive matter, because people&#146;s motives for doing it may, on the one hand, be entirely virtuous, or, on the other, somewhat selfish in that they may think that a new electoral system will be to their advantage.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="07070542000616"></a>Electoral systems are sensitive in that way and it is important that councils take proper steps to consult people reasonably and that, having consulted, they consider the representations made before making decisions. We all know of councils that are models of consultation and consider the responses. We also know of councils that are not so good. It is a fundamental point. I beg to move.</p>

Therefore, one has much sympathy with the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, but the Minister made a valid point about the need for a two-thirds majority. I have already had discussions with several district councils which would like to change, but think that they are most unlikely to get the two-thirds majority. It has been suggested that people might want to switch backwards and forwards because of political necessity; this will not happen because of the two-thirds majority. Indeed, the two-thirds majority might be too restrictive in getting enough to change.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07070542000618"></a>Elections every four years are much the best way of enabling a mandate to get things done. We have three-year finance plans, et cetera. It is ridiculous when authorities change political control year by year. It is not good for the people in that area. I am a little concerned that the two-thirds majority will stop some of the district councils going to four-yearly elections, when the majority of people there would like to do so. Some of the fears expressed are unfounded, but we support consultation of the electorate.</p>

As presently worded, the Bill would allow the local authority to determine the extent of the consultation. Any general council will have members from all political parties and none, and I would like to believe that we can trust it to make sure that its corner is respected. I hesitate to believe that any local authority will not be minded to ensure that it cannot be attacked on the grounds of bias, or in any other way, if it is seeking to consult with the populace as to what should change, and when and how. The amendment, to make sure that certain things happen, is unnecessary in this situation.</p>

I speak today for the first time not as chairman of the Local Government Association, having ceased to be that yesterday. My experience, going around the country, shows that it is in the interests of good local government to have elections every four years. The kind of strategic, long-term decisions that need to be made must be taken with a four-year view. These include financial decisions, the decisions that Michael Lyons concentrated on around the place-making issue, the regeneration of towns and work with partners. Local government is expected to work in strategic partnership with local area agreement boards today. You simply cannot change the council representatives every year. It is absolutely imperative that we do all we can to encourage councils to go for whole-elections every four years.</p>

I fully appreciate his concerns about the need to ensure that local authorities publicise any changes as widely and as appropriately as possible. Again, I fear that I must return to the point about the amendment being far too prescriptive. As I have said, these amendments are all concerned with the level of consultation to be undertaken by a district council that proposes to change its scheme for elections.</p>

<a name="70705-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07070542000622"></a>The Government do not believe that it is necessary to specify exactly who the district council should take reasonable steps to consult, other than to say that it should be anyone whom the council thinks it appropriate to consult on the change. This is part of devolution and we need to trust local authorities, democratically elected and accountable to their electorate, to consult those people whom one might reasonably expect to be consulted on such matters, including local government electors. We therefore do not believe that including specific provision in the Bill is necessary. The amendments go against the devolutionary spirit of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07070542000623"></a>At Second Reading, when I had what I would not quite call the pleasure of making the Second Reading speech for my noble friend Lady Andrews, the point that struck me in the debate that followed was the consensus on the encouraging devolutionary nature of the Bill.

The point that I made earlier was that electoral matters are different in kind from many other things because they affect the very existence or membership of the authority. However, having listened to the discussion, I will reply to some of the points made when we discuss the next amendment and, for the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="07070542000630"></a>Concerning the years, there seems to be a belief that all councils that have whole-council elections in a particular category should poll on the first Thursday in May in the same year. I see no reason why that should happen. It is a view of neatness which is a national view but has no relevance whatever to people in a particular authority. What does it matter to someone in Leeds whether the council polls in the same year as a council in Scunthorpe? It really does not matter at all.</p>

We have a job to promote local government elections, for example, as not enough people vote in them. There would be even more confusion if one place had an election in one year and one in another year. Other countries, everywhere in the world, seem to have similar elections on certain days&#151;most countries have it planned for many years ahead. I would be opposed to having different sorts of elections at different times. That would add confusion and make even fewer people vote than vote now.</p>

As I understand the situation, the law lays down that all district or metropolitan or any other class elections should take place at the same time. If, in pursuit of freedom, democracy and devolution, it is left to the whim or otherwise of every local authority to determine when it should have its elections, that would be a recipe for chaos. I may have got it wrong&#151;it would not be for the first time&#151;but I am asking a question. If my surmise is correct, I do not think that the amendment would improve the reputation or the well-being of local authorities in the eyes of the public.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1216"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Amendments Nos. 65, 77 and 85 would remove the resolution periods, which would mean that district councils would be able to resolve and then change their schemes for elections at any time. That relates to the question of chaos just mentioned by my noble friend. Currently, there is a clear pattern of elections by type of authority across England. All the councils of the same class&#151;county council, London borough, metropolitan district and non-metropolitan district&#151;that operate the same scheme of elections do so in the same years. For example, all non-metropolitan districts on whole-council elections elect in 2011, 2015 and so on.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07070542000637"></a>The resolution periods ensure that the pattern continues. To remove them and allow elections to take place at different times across the country would cause considerable confusion for all those involved in local government elections, including the electors, no doubt. It would also be detrimental to those who wish to stand as county and district councillors if elections took place in the same year, which is currently prevented by the timing of the resolution periods. The resolution periods are set so that, once a decision is made, the change happens as soon as possible and the national pattern of elections for different classes of council is maintained.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="07070542000638"></a>We are also opposed to Amendment No. 68. Whole-council elections for non-metropolitan district councils have always taken place in the same year. The 1972 Act set the years of elections as 1979 and every fourth year thereafter. This pattern has been followed since then. We do not believe that this should be changed by the Bill, because it provides clarity to electoral administrators, political parties, candidates and, above all, electors. Allowing councils to have elections whenever they liked would increase confusion among all the groups and not lead to effective local government elections.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="07070542000639"></a>We have carefully considered Amendments Nos. 66, 67, 86 and 87. After the initial extended resolution period that begins with the commencement of Part 2, the Bill provides for short resolution periods of three months. We have proposed these three-month periods to give a short, specified opportunity to pass a resolution. Following this, the council will be able to get on with normal business under its existing electoral cycle or prepare for a change in the cycle. The consultation, which we have already discussed and agreed to be important, and the local debate that will be needed can take place prior to the three-month period. It is only the resolution that must be passed during that three-month period. Three months is sufficient for councils to be able to hold a meeting and pass a resolution. However, we are listening to the concerns raised by the noble Lords opposite.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07070542000640"></a>In the light of my remarks, I hope that noble Lords will not press Amendments Nos. 65, 68, 77 and 85. We give an undertaking to think further about Amendments Nos. 66, 67, 86 and 87. I hope that that provides the Committee with some clarification.</p>

Among non-metropolitan districts and existing unitary authorities, there are already three different systems of elections. Many still poll by thirds, seven poll by halves&#151;I am grateful for an Answer from the Minister this week, because I know how many of them there are now&#151;and the rest use whole-council elections. These are not separated into different parts of the country; the pattern is very mixed up all over the place.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07070542000642"></a>Nobody thinks that this causes real confusion. The Electoral Commission did some work on it in 2003 and its report, <I>The </I><I>C</I><I>ycle of </I><I>Local Government Elections </I><I>in England</I>, recommended that there should be whole-council elections once every four years. It suggested that that would provide a model that would be equitable and easy to understand and would best serve the interests of electors. But when I talk to people at a local level, I cannot find anybody who thinks it important that the years in which their council is elected&#151;whether by thirds, by halves or by the whole council&#151;should be decided by what people in other parts of the country think. By and large, there are established patterns. It is interesting that, despite the fact that authorities have been able to move to whole-council elections since 1974, of the non-metropolitan districts that originally opted for election by thirds, only 11 have done so.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07070542000643"></a>There is a great deal of conservatism about local election systems, but the reason for that is that people are used to what happens in their areas. The Electoral Commission said that people do not know when the elections are going to be and what is going on. If there is an election every four years, they will not know in which year it is coming up. In an election in an area such as ours, where we have a local election every year&#151;three times for the district and once for the county&#151;people know. They know that there is a council election on the first Thursday in May, or some time in the spring, every year. What determines voters knowing when the elections are coming up is how much publicity there is about the elections before they take place. That partly depends on whether the council is publicising them adequately, but it mainly depends on the candidates in the local political parties. They are the people who tell the public when the polls are and who say, &#147;Come on, get out and vote&#148;. I really do not think that confusion exists among electors.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07070542000644"></a>The one argument that I accept&#151;the noble Lord mentioned it&#151;is about the two-tier system. In two-tier areas, it would be stupid to have the district council elections on the same day as the county elections, although I remind noble Lords that that is what used to happen in urban districts and municipal boroughs before 1974. It was not very satisfactory. The turnout in county elections was always significantly below the turnout in district elections. Having two elections in two months was not a very satisfactory state of affairs. So I accept that that should be the case. On the rest of it, I do not agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="07070542000645"></a>There is a lot to be said for all London boroughs perhaps polling on the same day, because they all use whole-council elections. If they are to stay that way, there is sense in having local arrangements like that. But for metropolitan districts that go to whole-council elections, if any do, it does not matter on which of the four years two or three out of the 10 or 11 districts in Greater Manchester, for example, poll. If Wigan and Stockport decide to go for whole-council elections, the fact that they are in different years would not make the slightest difference, because the rest of Greater Manchester would still be polling every year. I think that this issue has been grossly overstated. It is a matter of neatness and tidiness by administrators at a national level and has nothing to do with the situation on the ground.

For a year or two, it has been policy for the Government to encourage people to move away from whole-council elections. Before then, the opposite was the case. It all depends on who is doing the thinking, the reports, the surveys or happens to be in Downing Street advising or dreaming up new ideas for the Government. I do not criticise people for doing that useful job, but it depends on the theme or fad of the moment. What gets put in legislation is accidental: it depends on where the fad of the moment coincides with another Bill in which it can be inserted. That is how it works.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="07070542000657"></a>There are good arguments for both whole-council elections and for elections by thirds, some of which have been put forward today. At the local district level, there are very strong arguments in favour of annual elections by thirds. There are probably good arguments in favour of elections every two years,  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1219"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which is a good compromise because it provides an administration with two years to get on with things before having to go to the polls again. However, for many councils, every four years is too long. It may provide people with the opportunity to make strategic decisions and strategic choices, although that may be a large council view coming from Kent County Council; I do not in any way criticise that. For smaller councils and for more compact urban councils, there is a great deal to be said for the turnover of members being evolutionary rather than sudden and catastrophic. Some of these big councils do not change their political composition very often anyhow and it takes a substantial national change of political climate for that to happen.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07070542000658"></a>Having decided that they want to encourage councils to move to whole-council elections, though not forcing them to do so, the Government produced this Bill. As a result of pressure that was put forward in the House of Commons in favour of annual elections or alternate half-council elections, the Bill has been modified&#151;I think it was on Report in the Commons&#151;to allow those councils which had previously been electing by thirds or halves and then moved to whole-council to move back again. This seems illogical. If it is okay for the seven councils that elect by halves or the 11 councils that had moved to whole-council from a third to move back again, why can other people not move back? This seems an issue on which the Government should let the councils make their own decisions to move in either direction. There is no serious evidence that leadership in whole-council elections is better than leadership in election by thirds or halves. That evidence does not exist and people should be acting on what is being said about devolution.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07070542000659"></a>The arguments for annual elections or elections in halves are that if change is taking place, it takes place more slowly. There is greater stability. You do not have the risk that a party that has been running a council for four years&#151;doing a good or bad job&#151;is swept out not because of its record locally, but because it happens to be the party of the Government of the day, who are in mid-term and extremely unpopular, and people are voting for non-local reasons. Most people in local elections nowadays vote for local reasons, or far more than people think. Nevertheless, there are occasions&#151;and some of us can remember such years in the past&#151;when everybody of one party is swept out. It happened in 1990 when the Labour Party swept the board; it happened in 1977 when the Tories swept the board. Having annual elections is a safeguard against local decision-making and local politics being quite so subject to such an undesirable. I was a member of Lancashire County Council from 1977 to 1981. At that time Lancashire County Council, which has been Labour-controlled since 1981, consisted of 84 Conservatives, 12 Labour members&#151;including the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, whom I first met then&#151;and me. That was it. It was an absolute travesty. For that to last four years was not desirable for local government. I therefore believe that there ought to be local decision-making on this and that

That is in the spirit of these devolutionary days and the devolutionary rhetoric that we have heard from Ministers. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70705-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="07070542000661"></a>The Electoral Commission has recommended that whole-council elections should be put in place across the country. While accepting that whole-council elections have benefits in terms of direct accountability, the White Paper recognised that some areas have a tradition of partial council elections&#151;elections by halves and elections by thirds. We are therefore allowing councils that have previously operated elections by halves or by thirds to revert to them. However, where a council has always held whole-council elections&#151;which is the pattern of elections that the Electoral Commission has both recommended and demonstrated to be in the interests of electors and effective democratic processes&#151;it would be perverse now to give them the option of moving away from that system. The Government are promoting a very consistent policy; this is why we have limited the councils that can move to halves to the ones which have a tradition of that system of elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="07070542000662"></a>I hope the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment. As I have said, if he wishes to discuss matters at greater length outside the Committee, I shall be very happy to do so. However, we have been very clear through the White Paper and through the passage of the Bill in another place that it is important to recognise existing traditions while promoting our overarching policy of whole elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="07070542000684"></a>Where, after having undertaken the review, the Boundary Committee recommends that electoral changes are made to the council&#146;s area, Clause 51 ensures that, in making the order that implements the new scheme&#151;the partial-council elections order&#151;the Electoral Commission does not have to include provision for anything that can be provided for in an order made under Section 17 of the Local Government Act 1992.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000130"></a> Clause 5, page 3, line 12, after &#147;person&#148; insert &#147;aged 16 or over&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000009"></a>The noble Lord said: Since this is the first amendment to the clauses dealing with biometrics, I begin by drawing the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that the general heading for Clauses 5 to 15 is &#147;Biometric registration&#148;. Similarly, the heading for Clause 5 is &#147;registration regulations&#148;. However, the term &#147;registration&#148; does not appear in any of the clauses. I consulted the Public Bill Office about this and was told that the Grand Committee has no power to change those words. If the Government can do so&#151;I assume that they may want to&#151;I suggest to the Minister that the general heading should be &#147;Biometric information&#148; and the clause heading should be &#147;Biometric immigration document&#148;. In both cases, that would be a more accurate description of what the clause&#151;or clauses, as the case may be&#151;are about.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000010"></a>The only reference to age in Clauses 5 to 15 is in Clause 6(3), which provides that, where under-16s are to provide biometric information, the relevant regulations must be,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000140"></a>&#147;similar to section 141(3) to (5) and (13) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000113"></a>which deal with procedures for fingerprinting under-16s. This matter was debated in another place. The Minister there said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000141"></a>&#147;discussions were taking place at the EU level on the collection of biometric data from children, with a view to deciding whether children from the ages of five or six upwards could have their data taken&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, UK Borders Bill Committee, 1/3/07; col. 96].</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000011"></a>The Public Bill Committee was given evidence by Professor Ross Anderson and others, which showed that collecting biometric data from children is difficult and can produce false results. An EU presidency document of June 2006, on setting a minimum age for recording and storing facial images and fingerprints, reported a study by the Netherlands ministry of the interior, which came to the following conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000131"></a>&#147;The facial changes taking place up to the age of 12 are so marked that face recognition is not possible without highly sophisticated software and the considerable expense that goes with it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000114"></a>The document goes on to state that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000142"></a>&#147;small children ... will not normally be suitable subjects for biometric face recognition by means of a photograph&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000115"></a>In relation to fingerprints, it concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000132"></a>&#147;Scientific tests have confirmed that the papillary ridges on the fingers are not sufficiently developed to allow biometric capture and analysis until the age of six. Even then account must be taken of the fact that major changes take place as children grow and this will entail considerable expense in the form of computer programs. When checks are carried out, the software must make allowance for age-related changes, or no match will be possible. The same procedure will be necessary for face recognition&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000116"></a>The Netherlands authority continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000133"></a>&#147;Children over the age of six do have measurable fingerprints, but these are subject to particularly marked changes as the child grows, with the result that special algorithms must be used in order to calculate the changes and arrive at a result which is as accurate as for an adult&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000117"></a>Professor Ross Anderson told the Public Bill Committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000143"></a>&#147;fingerprint technology is certainly not good enough if you are matching one population against another, say 90 million people a year arriving at Heathrow versus 60 million people in the UK. You will get absolutely swamped by false matches&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000118"></a>He went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000144"></a>&#147;the error rate is very much lower [for iris scans] and as far as we are aware they are the only biometric which is powerful enough to be able to match a population against itself&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000012"></a>On the specific problems of measuring biometric data of children, Professor Anderson answered a question by saying,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000145"></a>&#147;iris codes are stable throughout life, as they are formed in the womb in the second to third month of pregnancy. Fingerprints are more difficult, because children may not have as prominent fingerprints as adults. Even though they may not change, they may have a higher error rate in measurement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000119"></a>When we were discussing the Identity Cards Bill the Minister&#151;the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal&#151;said that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000146"></a>&#147;have no immediate plans to reduce the age below 16 as the cost of doing so far outweighs any benefits that may arise. This is due to the fact that children have unstable biometrics which would result in them frequently having to re-register&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/11/05; col. 1681.]</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000120"></a>It would also be expensive and time consuming for children to travel, with their parent or guardian, to the data collection point, and disruptive to their education. The Refugee Children's Consortium is concerned that the practicalities of taking biometrics from children have not been properly considered.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000013"></a>Will the Minister tell the Committee what information the Government have about the costs of the software to calculate age-related changes in biometric information and how this will be funded? At what intervals do they envisage taking biometrics from a child under the age of 16? I remind the Minister, while I am in question mode, that he owes me answers to a good many questions from Monday, on which I very much hope officials are working. I trust that we shall not have to wait until the end of the Grand Committee stage before we know the answers to some of the puzzles that we have already given the Minister.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000014"></a>The regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Bill states that one of the key benefits of the compulsory recording of the biometric details of third country nationals is,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000147"></a>&#147;to align with the wider National Identity Scheme to ensure that there are no gaps in the system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000121"></a>The Identity Cards Act 2006 applies to UK nationals aged 16 and over, but the Government intend the BIDs of foreign nationals to be issued to children who are aged somewhere between five and 16, presumably depending on what is decided at EU level. I would be grateful if we could have an assurance from the Minister that we will not go ahead with any scheme for taking biometrics from under-16s until there is a common EU position on the matter. It would obviously be very inconvenient if we had a different age from the rest of Europe.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000015"></a>In another place, the Minister implied that the difference between the Identity Cards Act 2006 and this Bill is that here we must extend the collection of biometrics to all those subject to immigration control, but the BIDs will not be designated as ID cards for under-16s.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000016"></a>The Refugee Children's Consortium believes that children seeking asylum must be treated as children first and foremost, and that provisions such as the introduction of biometric identity cards for asylum-seeking children must be aligned with provisions that already exist for biometric identification for children in the UK. This would avoid potential stigma. The issue is not whether the biometric immigration documents will be designated as ID cards but that biometric data will be taken from asylum-seeking children under the age of 16, when that is not the policy for UK nationals under the national identity card scheme because of the costs and instability of data.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000017"></a>The Refugee Children's Consortium is concerned generally about extending any provisions for biometric registration documents to under-18s. It points out that Article 16 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights provide children with the right to respect for their private and family life without unlawful interference. Without full details of how the Government plan to use such a registration scheme, it is not possible to determine in Committee whether its application to under-18s would be in accordance with their rights. If the registration scheme is to be used to regulate access to public services, additional UNCRC rights, such as that defined in Article 24, which grants the right to access healthcare services, would also be engaged.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000018"></a>Finally, the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium is very concerned about the use of biometric immigration documents in order to provide access to public services of all kinds. In the case of children, their welfare needs and entitlement to basic human rights such as food, shelter, education and healthcare must always come before their immigration status. As noted above, children&#146;s biometric data are unstable and will have to be checked through complex and costly computer software that makes allowances for age-related changes. We would be concerned if difficulties in any technological process denied children the right of access to essential services. I beg to move.</p>

I would grateful if the Minister could explain either now or later today what progress has been made towards establishing age assessment panels and perhaps age assessment centres so that greater expertise is made available. At the moment, many age assessment decisions are appealed and then accepted. However, children are caused a lot of distress if they are judged to be adults when in fact they are still children. This point may well arise in a later debate, but clearly it is important to ensure the utmost professionalism in determining these important questions.</p>

As I explained to the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium, the reason I did not table an amendment myself is that when the matter was debated in Committee in another place, at the end of that debate my honourable friend made it clear that we accepted the Government&#146;s explanations as far as they could go. He said that the Minister had,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000148"></a>&#147;addressed all those individual issues very fully and very enlighteningly&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, UK Borders Bill Committee, 8/3/07; col. 263.]</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000122"></a>So I am somewhat prevented from exploring the issues again. However, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is absolutely right to bring them to the attention of the Committee.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000021"></a>I agree that it is important for the Government to put on the record how they are going to cope with the science side of ensuring that biometric information taken from children is worth being used. It will be an intrusion into a child&#146;s life and there is the separate issue, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, of whether it is right for children to be expected to provide information. I do not address that point now because other amendments look at it in more detail and in the broader sense of human rights. However, if one looks at the scientific issues themselves, there is no doubt that several research documents point to the unreliability of biometrics when taken from children, particularly in facial recognition procedures. I would be grateful if the Minister could refer in particular to those matters.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000022"></a>Noble Lords who took part in the debates on the Identity Cards Bill&#151;I was glad to see that legislation move out of my life on 26 March last year; it finished its life in this House and I hope never to see its full implementation as regards a national identity register&#151;will recall that we considered what kind of information should be covered by biometric registration. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, now the Attorney-General, told us that there would be reliability in the use of biometrics because they would come from three sources. She told us repeatedly that we could be reassured because there would be fingerprints, iris recognition and facial recognition. We looked in particular at the problems associated with taking fingerprints and how they may be damaged in children&#151;that is less the case  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than in adults, but the risk is there; how with iris recognition there is always a certain failure rate; and how facial recognition for children does seem to present problems.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000023"></a>At the time I explained in detail my own difficulties when I became a volunteer guinea pig and had my own biometrics registered. The Home Office brought its van to Black Rod&#146;s Garden, and we were able to visit it and get our own identity documents. I thought that I would put all my prejudices aside and undergo the process. Not only did the uplink keep failing but the facial recognition was a problem. For some reason I have a difficult bone structure; they called it bland. I have a bland face; that&#146;s me. It is an absolute shame. They took several attempts before they managed to capture enough of a facial recognition. I put up with it because I was trying to prove a point one way or the other&#151;and, boy, did I satisfy myself that there were problems. It comes back to the questions of how reliable this will be and what it will do to children to go through it. Will they have to go through the procedure repeatedly as their facial structure changes over the years? That is the kind of information on which we need reassurance from the Minister.</p>

He mentioned that he was awaiting replies to questions he had posed previously. I raise this matter now for the simple reason that we are in Grand Committee where we have the disadvantage of not being able to divide on some of the issues that most concern us. If we do not get these replies on time, we intend to use the full force of Report and Third Reading to pursue the matter. The fact that we cannot do certain things in Committee is often resented. I put it on record that we may prolong this opinion-seeking approach right up to Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000026"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070547000163"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I shall respond to the points made in this very important debate. I cannot resist commenting on the notion that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, should be considered bland in facial recognition terms. I have never thought that she was bland, and she certainly is not in personality. It would be a travesty if that was ever thought to be the case. I should apologise for the technology; it seems fairly disgraceful in those terms.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the biometric information heading. It is an integral part of these provisions that a person subject to immigration control registers their biometrics. That is what frames the debate and the legislation.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000028"></a>Amendment No. 13ZA would prevent the Secretary of State from requiring a person subject to immigration control who is under 16 to apply for a biometric immigration document. When a person is granted  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leave to enter or remain in the UK, whether a child or an adult, they are currently issued with an immigration document which demonstrates their right to be in the United Kingdom. The intention behind the biometric immigration document is to phase out the less secure forms of documents to replace them with a reliable biometric document.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000029"></a>This amendment would mean that the documents provided to children would be less secure and hence less trusted. In the near future it will also be contrary to our European obligations if a biometric card is not issued to those under 16 years of age who are granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom, as EC law will require this.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000030"></a>In our view taking biometrics from children is a positive factor in combating their trafficking and exploitation through making identification more certain and secure. We need to be able to fix children to a single identity to make them less attractive to those who wish to exploit them. This will reduce the risk of a child being passed off as someone else&#146;s child in that exercise.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000031"></a>The Border and Immigration Agency has experience over many years of taking fingerprints from children aged five and upwards without difficulty or, for that matter, without public concern. Fingerprint patterns do not change as a child grows older, and the technology is capable of recognising images taken from a person at a relatively young age.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000032"></a>We already record and check the fingerprints of children requiring biometric visas and the children of asylum seekers issued with application registration cards&#151;ARCs as they are often know.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000033"></a>From 2002 to 2006, the Border and Immigration Agency issued some 39,401 application registration cards to children aged between five and 16. Biometric data collection technology is being rolled out to all our overseas posts and the offices of our commercial partners. UKvisas has already collected biometric data, as part of the visa application process, from 5,679 children aged five to 16 between September 2006 and the end of April 2007. That number will increase as the number of overseas posts able to issue biometric enabled visas increases during this year.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000034"></a>I turn to our commitments in the European Union. In 2003, the United Kingdom signed up to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1030/2002 of 13 June 2002&#151;laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals&#151;which requires a standard residence permit to be issued to anyone, including a child, authorised to stay in a member state. A forthcoming European regulation will require the UK to issue a biometric card containing fingerprints and a photograph when it authorises a person to stay in the UK. The biometric immigration document will be how the UK complies with this obligation. It will be issued to those aged under 16 as the authorisation which permits them to be in the UK.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000035"></a>Discussions are continuing in the EU on what age children should have their fingerprints recorded&#151;and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to that debate. However, there appears to be a consensus in the European Council that the fingerprints of children will be recorded from at least six years of age.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000036"></a>Clause 6(3) provides safeguards by requiring any regulation made under these provisions which relate to those aged under 16 to make provisions similar to Section 141(3) to (5) and (13) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; that is about fingerprinting children. Staff dealing with children and young people will have to receive relevant training and will be obliged to conform to guidance to enable them to do so sensitively.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000037"></a>Biometric immigration documents issued to children aged under 16 will not be designated under the Identity Cards Act 2006.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000038"></a>We consider that 16 years is an appropriate level to set as the first age where an individual is eligible for an identity card and registration on the national identity register. Unlike immigration documents, which are required by both children and adults, identity documentation is, in most cases, first required when individuals become economically active; that is, have the right to leave school, marry, start work and open their own bank account. Biometric immigration documents issued to children aged under 16 will expire after five years or when their leave expires, whichever is sooner.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000039"></a>I hope that that answers most of the points raised. Of the others, I think that the most important one is the reliability and viability of biometric fingerprint technology. What can I say about that? Biometric fingerprint technology is used worldwide and is recognised as a secure form of matching identities. We have a lot of experience of using fingerprint biometric technology on children as young as five. Fingerprint patterns and characteristics do not change as a child grows older, and the technology is capable of recognising images taken from a person at a young age. The biometric immigration documents issued to children under 16 will expire in no later than five years. We will need at that point to update facial images, just as we currently do for passports. As part of the process, we will update any other biometric and non-biometric information as required.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000040"></a>I think it was the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who asked what progress we were making on establishing age assessment centres. I do not have that information today, but I undertake to correspond with noble Lords on that point and to share the fruits of that correspondence with all colleagues in Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether the points raised in debate on Monday will be responded to quickly. I have signed off the correspondence this afternoon. If the noble Lord likes, I could ask someone to collect it and deliver it to those Members in Committee who want it this afternoon if that would help them, although I think that our debates have moved on a bit from some of those issues.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000041"></a>Why fingerprints? They are widely used across the world. I have explained about expiry, and the software cost of procurement is already accounted for. We already have considerable experience of using biometrics with children. This makes a lot of sense, and it offers important protection, enabling us to help those young persons who we think are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation through trafficking. There

On the general point about fingerprints, the noble Lord said that the system is used worldwide, which it is, and that it is thoroughly reliable. I hate to say to him that the clause applies to Scotland. He may know that recently a lady police officer was said in court to have been present at a certain place at a certain time when a crime was committed, because her fingerprints were found there. She denied that. She was then accused of perjury, because the fingerprint system is considered to be completely foolproof. That was a terrible thing for her. Subsequently, it was discovered that the fingerprint matching system&#151;which is separate in Scotland, I think it is a fingerprint agency there&#151;was not in fact foolproof, and she received a very large sum in compensation rather than all that going back to court. The noble Lord&#146;s officials may know about that; I cannot expect him to know about it. It was a very big case in Scotland not very long ago.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000043"></a>This business of fingerprints is not completely simple. The final inquiry has not yet take place, and we may hear more. I urge a little bit of caution, particularly if it is more problematic with children. A six year-old&#146;s fingers are a bit podgy. I have a fruit bowl with some of my great nephews&#146; and nieces&#146; fingerprints on it, which they did at school, and it is pretty blurred. I am sure that the system is very much better than that, but I can see that there might be problems.</p>

I am glad that she quoted the case in Scotland, because as a result of that case I looked more closely at the science of taking fingerprints. Perhaps I, like so many lay people&#151;even though I had been a magistrate&#151;had assumed that when matching fingerprints there was a standard number of points that one used to achieve a match. It was only as a result of the case in Scotland that I appreciated that different methods are used in different parts of the world. It would be very helpful if the Government were able to tell us how points of reference would be used for the matching process in regard to fingerprints.</p>

Like my noble friend, the system has failed to recognise me. I have become something of an expert on fingerprints. Whenever I travel now, I put my finger into a slot in various terminals and if I am recognised I am admitted and given a free drink, but my recognition rate is only two out of seven. One of the reasons is that if one works fairly hard at various jobs in rural areas, one can rub away the end of one's fingerprint, so it is not reliable. I can assure the noble Lord that fingerprints may be reliable in certain circumstances, but for the traveller it is a most unreliable science. It is also great fun. As I have explained before, if one fails to get in for the free drink, one can take a piece of plastic, put it on one&#146;s finger and press it into the slot it recognises again the fingerprint of the previous person and one is admitted and given a free drink.</p>

Nevertheless, if much more reliable technology comes along, it would be a mistake for the Government to drop all research on it and not to keep it in reserve in case we find, to our horror, that the system, once in place, results in a great many false positives, or indeed lets people through who are not entitled to be in this country. Either way, it is regrettable if we had no other technology to fall back on.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000051"></a>I accept, however, that the Government have very little option, considering what the Minister told us about the compatibility that we need with European systems and the need to carry on with the fingerprint system for the time being. He mentioned that the standard residence permit, which is being developed to require the inclusion of biometrics, will apply across the European Union, and thus our system must be aligned with it. I therefore fully accept that we have no option for the time being but to go down that route.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000052"></a>I asked the Minister about the headings, and I would be grateful for an answer.</p>

In general, it is a mistake for draftsmen to give groups of clauses headings that do not correspond to the Bill. I believe that that has happened in this case. We keep on talking about registration&#151;a word that occurs both in the heading given to the clause and to the group&#151;but nowhere in the Bill is registration mentioned. That is anomalous. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanations to the Committee and, for the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

At our last sitting on Monday, I commented on the useful practice that had been adopted in another place of taking expert evidence in a Public Bill Committee, and suggested that we might do the same in Grand Committee. Although we elicited no reaction from the Minister at that time, I am grateful to him for saying that he has already written to us about the points that were made on Monday, and I very much hope that he will see that it is included in his remarks.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000058"></a>At its 1 March sitting, the Standing Committee&#151;or Public Bill Committee, as I must learn to call it&#151;took evidence from Professor Ross Anderson, the professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge. He said, as I mentioned already, that the Government were going down the wrong route in using fingerprints rather than irises, as that made the system far more prone to errors. However, he also made some interesting comments on why public sector IT projects are so much more liable to over-run on cost than private sector projects. Perhaps I may quote from his evidence:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000135"></a>&#147;Projects that have constantly shifting specifications are most likely to fail&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000123"></a>That should sound an alarm bell for the UK Borders Bill, and the ID and e-borders project. The stated goals are shifting too much and too often for us to be confident that robust systems will be built on time and within budget. Translating that warning into a procedure for scrutinising the Bill, we should be challenging the enormous breadth of the BID regulations and seeking to persuade the Government to tell us what they intend to do and whether they have any idea at this stage of how the systems are going to work. I am glad to see later amendments where the Government attempt to go into a bit more detail than we have had hitherto.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000059"></a>This amendment is intended to elicit from the Minister an explanation of the meaning of this paragraph as one example out of the many that we could have picked. Can he explain the meaning of the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000149"></a>&#147;in connection with specified immigration procedures&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000124"></a>and can he give us any examples? If the document is to be used, that implies that it has to be produced. The official for whom it is produced will then have to be able to read the biometric information on it, presumably to compare it with a database of BIDs. Which officials will have the technology to do this and where will they be located? Is this another case like that of passport applications, a point raised by my noble friend Lord Roberts, where there were only 67 locations in the whole of the United Kingdom to which a person could apply? Although it was claimed that remote locations were being provided with places where the information could be inputted into the system via a webcam&#151;presumably the same thing could be done with fingerprints&#151;the number of locations was few and far between. There were whole areas of the country in which people would have had to travel considerable distances in order to access the system. Further, will there be different levels of use with a larger number of officials looking only at the alphanumeric information and being able to refer the holder to someone else if a question arises that can be answered only by the biometrics? If the Minister cannot answer these questions, we will be walking into a situation where the contractors who are to provide the technology are given only a very general specification, the details being filled in as the project develops. That is the very scenario which Professor Anderson has warned leads to cost overruns on public sector IT projects.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000060"></a>I turn now to another set of concerns raised by the JCHR and I shall be interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has to say about them. The Joint Committee complained about the open-ended powers in the biometric clauses and voiced its fear that Article 8 rights would be infringed. It was unable to assess the compatibility of the power with Article 8 because there were no draft regulations. The committee wrote to the Minister asking for further details. As we would expect, the Government reassured the JCHR that the Bill and its secondary legislation would be fully compatible with Article 8, their objective being to ensure that everyone subject to immigration control has a secure BID confirming his or her immigration status and identity. The document would link into the national identity scheme&#151;there was some discussion in another place about these proposals being a pilot for identity cards which was not denied by the Government and is now, I think, common knowledge&#151;and would enable other government departments, employers and public agencies to confirm that the holder was eligible for employment or state benefits, and presumably for medical treatment, although this was not mentioned. It would stop anyone fraudulently obtaining a national insurance number.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000061"></a>The JCHR, having considered the Government&#146;s response, found that it was unable to assess the compatibility of the scheme with the right to respect for family life in Article 8. As examples of the information the committee would have needed to reach a conclusion, it mentioned the type of biometric information, the purposes for which it was to be used, the extent to which it would apply to children&#151;as we have just discussed&#151;and the length of time it would be retained. The answers to these questions are now gradually seeping out, but are not such as to alleviate wholly the concerns on human rights raised by the JCHR.</p>
<h5><a name="07070547000154"></a>2.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000062"></a>The more we extend the uses of the document beyond immigration control into purposes that are wholly unrelated to immigration, such as access to benefits, health, education or employment, the more likely it is that errors will occur and that some holders will be deprived of their rights. The inaccuracy of one-to-many searches, as I have mentioned, was explored by Sub-Committee F in its inquiry on the Schengen Information System II. Clearly, for some of the purposes envisaged by the BID one-to-many searches will be necessary where the biometric on the document is compared with all the others on the database.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000063"></a>With SIS II, the legislation permits the use of one-to-many searches only once the Commission has reported that the relevant technology is available and ready, and Sub-Committee F recommended that independent experts should referee that report, and that it should be adopted by the Council only after consultation with the European Parliament, and that it should be deposited for scrutiny by the Select Committee.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000064"></a>In their reply to the Select Committee&#146;s recommendation, the Government accepted that one-to-many searches using fingerprints would be possible only when the Commission had produced its report. Therefore, I invite the Minister to tell the Committee  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that one-to-many searches using the biometric information in the BID will not be permitted either until the technology is given the all-clear by Europe. I hope the Minister will answer that question at the end of the debate.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000065"></a>In addition, if the system is to satisfy an increasing number of requirements which have nothing to do with our borders, but which are concerned with the internal policing of everybody of foreign appearance who applies for unemployment benefit or goes to a jobcentre or attends an interview with a prospective employer, or needs a dental check-up, the document is effectively already an identity card, as it will become in law in due course.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000066"></a>Professor Anderson told the Standing Committee in another place that he was unable to hazard a guess about how much of the &#163;20 billion that the London School of Economics estimates the scheme will cost overall would be carved out in developing the BIDs. When is this project going out to tender? What figure is included for it in the new spending estimates?</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000067"></a>The same considerations apply to Amendment No. 13B. I very much regret that the Explanatory Notes give the Committee no idea of what sort of specified circumstances the Government have in mind where a person&#146;s immigration or nationality status would make it necessary for the BID to be used. If it is to ascertain whether the person is eligible for employment, immigration status would be relevant. But would nationality every come into the picture, or could this sub-paragraph be a means of enabling employers to discriminate? The Minister no doubt saw the article in the <I>Guardian</I> yesterday about the denial of antenatal care to a migrant worker, reported by M&#233;decins du Monde, and the comment on its findings by the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Mr Paul Hunt. The average length of stay of the 349 women in the study was three years, so they obviously had not come to the UK for the purposes of getting free health treatment. Will the BID be a necessary passport to healthcare generally, and to prenatal care in particular? Are PCTs entitled to refuse care to failed asylum seekers? Is not this a despicable way of persuading them to leave us, in addition to the forced destitution under Section 9? I hope that we shall have some answers to these questions before we leave this clause. I beg to move.</p>

The expert evidence point is beyond my reflection, although perhaps it could be taken up through the usual channels. It would be novel; but it is not a bad idea for being novel. I always like to think that we can innovate. Whether it would be appropriate for all legislation is an open question. I can see some of the arguments that the noble Lord is making and their relevance.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000069"></a>I shall try to explain why Clause 5(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) are integral to how the biometric immigration document works, and therefore why the Government are resisting the amendment. It is perhaps worth briefly reminding your Lordships of the rationale for the introduction of biometric immigration documents. Currently, foreign  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nationals in this country can proffer any of around 60 types of document as evidence of their entitlement to be here, to work or to receive benefits. It would be accepted that a system with so many forms of verification is prone to abuse, and it is very difficult for those examining documents to know whether they are genuine or a forgery, or whether the person presenting them is part of a scam.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000070"></a>Over the coming years, therefore, we intend to phase out the use of old style immigration documents and endorsements and replace them with the biometric immigration document, which will serve as the document which authorises the holder to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. It will be the way in which the United Kingdom will comply with a forthcoming European regulation that will require the UK to issue a biometric document when leave is granted.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000071"></a>As the Bill states, we intend that the biometric immigration document should be used for specified immigration purposes, in connection with specified immigration procedures and in specified circumstances, where a question arises about a person&#146;s status in relation to their nationality or immigration. The types of immigration procedures and circumstances relating to nationality or immigration that the Secretary of State intends to specify will be set out in regulations and will be subject to the affirmative procedure. That seems to be the right way to proceed, because it provides for that secondary level of scrutiny and accountability.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000072"></a>Clause 5(1)(b)(ii) makes it clear that regulations can require the use of the document in the course of an immigration-related procedure. Accepting the amendment could mean that regulations could not require the holder of the document to produce the document in connection with certain immigration procedures. That could include the procedures that apply and which he must follow when the holder arrives at a port in the United Kingdom to show an immigration officer that he is entitled to enter the United Kingdom, or when a person applies to vary their leave. To avoid any suggestion that a person cannot be required to use the document as part of an immigration procedure, Clause 5(1)(b)(ii) is essential.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000073"></a>Amendment No. 13B would mean that regulations could not require a holder of a biometric immigration document to produce the document in specified circumstances when a question arises about their nationality or immigration status. That could mean that we would not be able to require the holder of a biometric immigration document to produce it to a prospective employer as evidence of eligibility to work, nor could regulations require the holder to produce it when accessing public services where immigration status is a relevant consideration to their entitlement.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000074"></a>As the project is rolled out, initial immigration uses will be where a person arrives at a port in the UK to demonstrate reliably their immigration status, or where a person applies to vary their leave to remain. As I have explained already, the biometric document will be used to establish whether a person is entitled to work. I hope that covers the points that the noble

I am left with some questions, which have not been answered. The Minister gave examples to illustrate why subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) are necessary, but those were covered in previous discussions on the Bill. I should like to know whether any circumstances other than those connected with employment and access to benefits are being concealed from the Committee. I mentioned one in particular that the noble Lord did not cover&#151;access to healthcare. I quoted the example that was given in yesterday&#146;s <I>Guardian</I> about women being denied antenatal care because it was alleged that they were failed asylum seekers. I particularly asked the Minister for a reply to that question. Apart from employers and jobcentres, it would be very useful for the Committee to know whether PCTs, general practitioners and others delivering health services will be required to examine the BID to see whether a person is eligible for healthcare. If that is the case, what are they to do in an emergency&#151;</p>

I encourage him to read the report on the administration of asylum policy which was recently published. We spent a great deal of time and took a great deal of evidence. It is worth looking at the evidence on this matter. If he intends to pursue it, he will find some very interesting material in that report, and the evidence on which it is based.</p>

Presumably, as the report was submitted on 30 March, the Select Committee will have had a reply to it by now, and the Minister ought to be able to give us an answer to the concerns that were raised by the JCHR. Therefore, I hope that before we leave this amendment the Minister will explain in precise terms how the BID is to be used to gain access to the health service and in what circumstances&#151;</p>

At present foreign nationals may in certain circumstances be charged for using the National Health Service. I think that it is fairly and properly understood that that is the case. We would never be in a position where someone suffering from a life-threatening condition would be denied healthcare as a result of their immigration status. That would never be the case. However, we currently require some verification. I think that most people would accept that that is right.</p>

I am grateful to noble Lords for their interventions because they have enabled me to find the paragraph in the Select Committee report on the point that I raised and to which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred. It says that there are cases in which people have been denied maternity and antenatal care in hospitals. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000136"></a>&#147;This is inconsistent with the principles of common humanity and with the UK's obligations under ECHR Articles 2, 3 and 8 ...

I urge the Minister to read paragraphs 140 to 143 of the Select Commission report, <I>The Treatment of Asylum Seekers</I>, and to tell your Lordships, if he can, whether the Government accepted that recommendation, and, if they did, what is his answer to the fact that these things are still happening in some PCTs. Women are being denied access to antenatal and maternity care, contrary to the recommendation of the JCHR. I am afraid that once people have these BIDs, every time they walk into a hospital, someone will say, &#147;You&#146;re not entitled to medical care because I see from your BID that you have reached the limit of your permitted leave to remain and, therefore, you are an over-stayer&#148;.</p>

That is not the purpose of the BID. The BID is designed to make clear someone's immigration status; it is not there to deny them a service. As I have already explained, it may be that in using those services they, quite properly, have to be charged for them. Then there is the issue of whether an individual is in a position to pay. No health care should be denied to people who are in need of it. That is the position. The BID is an immigration document that relates to their status here, their permission to stay in this country. It has been broadly welcomed, not least by many employers who wish to be absolutely clear and certain that they are not committing offences. That is the purpose of a BID. That is it.</p>

I am concerned about other ways in which the BID will be used and why it is not possible to specify them. If the Minister now says that there is no case in which persons will be denied access to health treatment because their BID is not current, or there is some flaw in it, let us put that in the Bill. If the only circumstances in which the BID is to be used for access to public services is when someone goes into the jobcentre and is asked to produce it to show that they are eligible for work, or in the private sector when they go to an employer and they produce a BID to show that they have the right to work in this country, then I am not arguing with the Minister. I am saying, &#147;Fine, let&#146;s put that on the face of the Bill. Let us say that the circumstances in which the BID has to be produced for any purpose other than immigration control is to grant access to paid employment and to grant access to benefits&#148;.

It is not just a question of how the Government intend the BID to be used; it is how it would actually be used on the ground that concerns the Committee at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000087"></a>On the healthcare point, just to put it on the record, the purpose of the biometric immigration document is to help identify a foreign national securely and reliably and to confirm the holder&#146;s immigration status. That is its principal purpose. I argue that in the end it would help healthcare officials to identify whether someone is entitled to free treatment. That would be a positive.

The implication of that document for people who may require certain services and the danger of that particular approach is relevant in the cases that my noble friend has identified. It is no good saying that we cannot deal with individual cases. In a previous debate, we discussed the case of a woman with a little baby who was arrested and detained and the baby did not have access to the mother&#146;s milk. Those are the sorts of cases that hit us hard. I do not say that the Minister deliberately creates that situation. The fact that the Select Committee has identified issues of serious concern means that it is right and proper for the Minister to look at that implication in relation to this particular issue.</p>

<p><a name="07070547000096"></a>If the gist of the Minister&#146;s remarks is that no one is to be denied access to health services as a result of the introduction of the BIDs, I very much welcome that assurance, but it is best taken care of if he accepts my suggestion that we narrow down the circumstances in which a BID can be required to be produced to the main ones that he has mentioned: access to employment and access to benefits. I would be very happy if the Bill could be amended so that those were the only two cases in which the BID had to be compulsorily produced. It would then become clear that a person could not be denied access to maternity or ante-natal treatment and that if he or she required medication, the pharmacist would not be able to refuse it on the ground that the BID was not current.</p>

I suggest that the Government look again at the Select Committee report and at their reply and think carefully, taking into account this afternoon&#146;s discussion, about whether they are able to comply with my suggestions about how the clauses should be redrafted to make it clear that nobody is to be denied access to health treatment.

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000103"></a>The Joint Committee paid a great deal of attention to this. It was very concerned about the Bill in general, but in particular about this part of it. Our conclusion, which relates to what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said a moment ago, was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070547000138"></a>&#147;In the absence of more detail on the face of the Bill or any draft regulations prescribing important details of the proposed scheme it was impossible to assess the compatibility of the proposed biometric registration scheme with the right to respect for private life in Article 8 ECHR&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000104"></a>The Joint Committee noted, for example, that the following important details of the proposed scheme are nowhere specified:</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000139"></a>&#147;the type of biometric information which will be required; the purposes for which such information may be used, which will apparently include use for purposes which do not relate to immigration, such as access to state benefits&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000127"></a>we have just discussed that at some length&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000150"></a>&#147;[and] the extent to which the requirements apply to children under the age of 16&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000105"></a>In a previous report, the Joint Committee expressed similar concerns about the Identity Cards Bill. It repeatedly expressed concern about the potentially discriminatory impact of introducing compulsory registration for non-nationals before nationals. This was in part due to the likelihood that compulsory registration for foreign nationals may lead to British citizens from visible minority ethnicities being subject to more frequent demands to produce an ID card or allow checks against the register.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000106"></a>The introduction of the biometric immigration document gives rise to exactly the same concerns about de facto racial profiling. Even though the Bill does not make it a requirement that such a document be carried, the fact that such a document exists for non-nationals and can be requested to prove entitlement to services makes it highly likely that members of black and minority ethnic communities in the UK will be disproportionately required to prove their immigration status.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000107"></a>The scheme&#146;s phased implementation could well give rise to a further risk of de facto racial profiling. In the Roma rights case, the House of Lords found the Home Office&#146;s policy of targeting Roma for pre-entry clearance at Prague airport to be inherently racially discriminatory and therefore unlawful. To be lawful, it is vital that race or ethnicity play no part in the profiles used by the Government to decide the order in which they phase implementation of the biometric immigration document. That was the very firm conclusion of the all-party Joint Committee on Human Rights, drawn from both Houses, including distinguished legal experience as well as lay experience. Everything we have just heard in the discussion on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, brings home to me the relevance of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations in this context. My amendments seek to give effect to our conclusion. If the Minister wants to meet our conclusion but has some real argument that there are other ways in which this could be done, I will be the first to listen to what he has to say and to take it seriously. At this stage, however, it is very important not to leave this simply as a pronouncement from a committee meeting upstairs, but to turn it into action that can be demonstrated in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

As we understand it, in due course, everyone subject to immigration control will be required to obtain the biometric document. The purpose of subsection (2)(a), which allows the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring the document to apply only to,</p>
<ul><a name="07070547000151"></a>&#147;a specified class of persons&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070547000128"></a>is that initially it may be convenient to get only those seeking leave to remain to apply and to take later those who already have permitted leave to remain to avoid swamping the system. A phased roll-out would enable the BIA to pilot the technology and the training of users so that any problems that arise can be dealt with progressively. We have no objection to that in principle.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070547000109"></a>The Explanatory Notes say that treating differently different classes of persons who are subject to immigration control for the roll-out is not discriminatory, and that any discrimination there is justified. The determining factors will be which categories present the greatest risk to immigration control and whether the technology and resources are available for particular applicants. As I see it, this would mean deploying the technology and resources preferentially to applicants who came from east Africa because the conflicts in Sudan and Somalia, and the severe human rights problems in Eritrea and Ethiopia&#151;</p>

The thinking seems to be that if every legal Somali had a BID, it would be easier to identify those who have arrived here illegally. Is that kind of discrimination justified, in the Government&#146;s opinion? If it is, we do not want them to have the unrestricted power conferred by this paragraph to single out classes of persons as guinea pigs for the biometrics proposed in the Bill. One way in which to ensure that the queue of people lining up for the BIDs was not arranged in a discriminatory way would be to appoint an independent person, not necessarily from the Liberal Democrat Benches, to act as a monitor of the introduction of biometrics and to report to Parliament from time to time on the compliance with discrimination legislation, the Data Protection Act and any other matters to which Clauses 5 to 15 refer. I do not expect the Minister to give me an off-the-cuff reply to that suggestion, but I would like him to mull it over and to say in due course whether he thinks that it is possible. I am sure that the whole of the Grand Committee would want to avoid any suspicion of discrimination in the way in which the roll-out is managed&#151;suspicion that would lessen confidence in the whole procedure. Therefore, in due course, I will invite the Minister to come back with an answer to my, I hope modest, proposal that we have an independent monitor of the roll-out and other matters in Clause 5.</p>

I often get in as much confusion as the noble Lord, but that is a secondary point to our debate.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000005"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, was able to highlight the concern of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He rightly mentioned the impact and the racial categorisations that are likely to emerge from this clause. Let me spell it out. The Joint Committee says that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070552000223"></a>&#147;to be lawful it will be vital that race plays no part in the process used by the government to decide the order in which it phases implementation of the biometric immigration document&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070552000195"></a>This will require very careful scrutiny when the time comes to implement the scheme, and it draws our attention to that.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000006"></a>It is necessary because the Government have often failed to consult the very body that they set up to look at issues of this nature, such as racial profiling and the discriminatory impact on particular groups of people in the community; I refer to the Commission for Racial Equality. Let me bring this point out. When we talked recently about the position of overseas doctors who are no longer qualified to stay in this country and who are to be sent back home, I raised with the Department of Health whether it had consulted the Commission for Racial Equality on the impact of its decision on people coming to take jobs in this country. There had been no such consultation whatever. The commission informed me that that was basically unacceptable, because it should have been consulted.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000007"></a>There is another issue. The Home Office is well aware that it increased the period of qualification in this country for registration from four to five years. I got in touch with the Commission for Racial Equality, and it had no knowledge of that. The commission has a duty to promote equality, and it has established the need for every public body, including government departments, to work out the racial impact of its policies. Has the Commission for Racial Equality been consulted on this? Has its opinion been obtained? If not, why not? Would it not be wise for Ministers to say that if that has not taken place, they will consult the commission, and come back on it? I have no doubt that the Commission for Racial Equality will support, more or less, everything that the Joint Committee has said.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000008"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0003.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="07070552000241"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions to a lively and stimulating debate. I well understand the concerns that have been  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expressed. Naturally, the Government have carefully studied the JCHR report on the Bill. I offer the assurance that the Government are clear that neither the biometric immigration document nor its implementation should give rise to de facto racial profiling. An amendment was made to the Bill in another place that there would be no requirement for the biometric immigration document to be carried at all times.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000009"></a>On implementation, Clause 5(2)(a) is designed to enable the biometric immigration document to be rolled out incrementally. If we were to accept Amendment No. 14, the Government would have to introduce the biometric immigration document to all third country nationals more or less simultaneously. We do not think that would be very workable. The purpose of an incremental roll-out is to avoid having a very large number of individuals applying for a biometric immigration document within a specific time frame.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000010"></a>Perhaps I can outline briefly how we intend to conduct that incremental roll-out. In order to ensure that these documents have the optimum chance of success and to best help those subject to their registration, I am sure noble Lords will accept that we need to manage the roll-out with some care. It is best achieved by a gradual and systematic implementation in accordance with a set of rational criteria.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000011"></a>First off, it would be best to include students from outside the EU, those seeking to settle in the United Kingdom having completed a five-year qualifying period, those applying to extend their work permits, and those seeking leave to remain on the basis of marriage to a UK citizen. In addition, it is important to appreciate that rolling out the biometric immigration document incrementally should minimise the burden placed on organisations that may be required to use it. We do not wish to jeopardise the success of the document when its value to border control and employers alike is very clear. It is therefore our intention from 2008 to roll out progressively biometric documents to qualifying foreign nationals subject to immigration control who are already in the United Kingdom and reapplying to stay here. This will allow us to trial the biometric recording and card production processes. These will need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that a robust and reliable system is in place, and it is then our ambition to cover by 2011 all new in-country applications for permission to stay in the United Kingdom. I can assure noble Lords that the roll-out will be undertaken on a rational basis in accordance with existing discrimination laws and the European Convention on Human Rights. To do otherwise would be unlawful and we would be rightly subject to challenge.</p>

I am sorry that he did not volunteer a name from the Liberal Democrat Benches because they seem to be rich in individuals who like undertaking that sort of work, and we greatly respect the political tradition of which that is a part. There is to be a chief inspector of the BIA, which will be created by this Bill. The responsibilities of the chief inspector will cover the need to monitor and report on several matters, including compliance with the law

The categories the noble Lord has just mentioned&#151;five-year residency, work permit renewals and spouses&#151;are obviously not those representing the greatest risk to immigration control. This may indicate that perhaps there has been a reconsideration since the Explanatory Notes were written, which is all to the good. However, where the Government propose to depart substantially from their previous commitments&#151;I believe that one can take the Explanatory Notes as being something of a commitment&#151;it would be useful if they would keep those immediately concerned with these matters informed by saying that they no longer adhere to this text, but have adopted different procedures.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000015"></a>I do not expect an answer from the Minister to my next point, but perhaps we can come back to it later. I am satisfied to a large extent with his undertaking that the chief inspector of the BIA will monitor the roll-out and ensure not only that it conforms with anti-discrimination legislation but also with the Data Protection Act. This will be fully covered in the remit of the chief inspector, and he or she will be able to report to Parliament from time to time on the management of the roll-out. Subject to those assurances, which I do not expect the Minister to give off the cuff in conclusion to this debate, I think that we have had some reasonably satisfactory answers.</p>

First, was racial profiling seriously considered? Even if racial profiling was not intended, could it inadvertently come about? Moreover, does the Minister accept that, even if it is not compulsory to carry the document, the fact that it exists and can be  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demanded when services are sought could lead to such racial profiling among ethnic minorities&#146; full British citizens and therefore to indiscriminate and disproportionate pressure on them in yet another sphere? Finally, will the Minister assure the Grand Committee that the Government are convinced&#151;and tell us why they are convinced&#151;that whatever they do will address the point that I underlined, and which was in the Joint Committee&#146;s report, that the registration scheme may be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the respect for private life as spelled out in Article 8 of the European convention?</p>

<p><a name="07070552000018"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07070552000245"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Hylton&#151;or it might have been the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;asked about data protection. Under Clause 47(2)(h), the chief inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency must also report on the provision of information. I think that that covers the point.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000019"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that the Government have put in place many very positive pieces of legislation to tackle discrimination. I take personal pride in having worked with the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and putting in place legislation, in 2000 or 2001, that tackled indirect discrimination. The inadvertent discrimination to which the noble Lord refers is probably covered by that legislation. I certainly hope that it is, although that is not to say that there is no discrimination from time to time because it has been legislated against. It certainly is not our intention that that should be the case. No doubt that is an issue on which the chief inspector will wish to focus some attention, not least because complaints have to be looked at.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000020"></a>The noble Lord asks again whether the existence of a BID means that black and ethnic minorities will be subject to de facto racial profiling. No, these provisions are about ensuring that individuals produce a reliable, secure document, as I have explained on many occasions in the course of our discussions, so that they can establish their immigration status. In the illegal-working context, the Secretary of State will issue a code to assist employers to conduct document checks so that there is a proper verification process, without recourse to any form of unlawful discrimination where public officials require the document. They, as I have already said, are subject to race relations legislation and it would not be lawful to require a BID to be produced based on appearance. That is clear and relates precisely to what I said at the outset.</p>

An employer knows he is under an obligation not to employ anyone who is here illegally. Is there not a temptation for him to safeguard his own back by saying to the applicant, &#147;Have you got a BID?&#148;, or, &#147;What other evidence have you got to satisfy me that I am legally empowered to employ you?&#148;?</p>

It is important to recognise that it is precisely through these kinds of measures, with their unintended consequences, that resentment is built up among the ethnic minority population in this country.

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000026"></a>If the Government, commendably, are emphasising the importance of the identity of citizenship, the confidence of citizenship, the importance of becoming a full UK citizen and so on, and the experience of a significant section of the population is that they are second-class citizens because they can be picked on and are being picked on more than white members of the community, that will cause resentment and will certainly lead to a feeling of profound hypocrisy about the whole process of government. If his department, of all departments, is talking about the importance of security, which in my view is related very strongly to the idea of full citizenship and the identity with citizenship, that point cannot be rationalised away. The points made by the Joint Committee are very real possibilities. We need to hear evidence why the Government believe that those possibilities will not become probabilities.</p>

There is a degree of equality of treatment here in any event.

They need to be in place so that employers can be reassured and protected.</p>

If a person who has previously been in employment and is transferring to another job can satisfy the employer that he has a national insurance number, that should be equally valid, whatever his racial or national origin. The existence of a national insurance number should prevent the employer demanding any other proof of his legal presence in the UK. I take it that it is only when a person goes to his first job in the UK, for example, having graduated from a university or left school, that he may not necessarily have a national insurance number. It is in those cases only that any doubt would arise as to his legitimacy as a person of residence in the UK and able to take employment. Perhaps the number of cases will be pretty small if the national insurance document is the primary evidence of ability to work.</p>

He has said all that the Government can say about the matter. That only underlines my anxieties, which were certainly accentuated by my participation in the discussions in the Joint Committee.

At present it is a completely open-ended question that is not even confined to information about the holder of the document. It could be information about any other matter. The Minister in another place said that it was important to capture a great deal of information that was not set out in the amendment. He went on to give examples, including two items that do appear in our list and two that do not: nationality and gender. If the Government are prepared to accept in principle that there should be a list, we would be perfectly happy to add those items to the ones already set out in our amendment. The object of the exercise is to specify what non-biometric information is to be included rather than to allow the Secretary of State to add any information he likes without even coming back to Parliament for approval.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000035"></a>If that is not palatable, would the Government agree to an amendment that would limit the non-biometric information at least to facts relevant to a person&#146;s immigration status? Earlier, the Minister referred to EU proposals for biometric resident permits and said that we need to ensure that the BID satisfies the conditions of that forthcoming regulation&#151;I entirely agree with that proposal. Can the Minister give us further details of that proposal, and in particular let us know where we can find it on the EU website, which in my experience is not easy to navigate? Will he also say whether the Government would agree to restrict the non-biometric information to what may be required for the purpose of compatibility with the EU resident&#146;s document, to which the UK may agree in future? Further, can we have an assurance that the data protection regime that applies to this information will comply fully with the regime covering the EU resident document?</p>

<p><a name="07070552000036"></a>I certainly hope that we are going to have some answers to our questions this afternoon. On Monday, we were not very successful in getting the information we were asking for, particularly about judicial review. However, I am grateful to the Minister for his earlier assurance that he would write to us. Indeed, he has already done so following Monday&#146;s proceedings. If we do not get answers in Grand Committee, I hope that at least we can have a further letter from the Minister dealing with any points he may have missed this afternoon. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the need for some form of guidance on what may comprise non-biometric information, and he seeks from the Government a list so that we can flesh out how they anticipate it will be developed. I have just advised the Bill team that it might be helpful to the Committee if I speak to Amendment No. 26 and group it with this amendment. I had intended that Amendment No. 26 would be taken separately, but given the way in which business is flowing today, that would not be helpful because it could well not be debated until another day.</p>

I apologise for not having given advance notice that I intended to group Amendment No. 26 here, but it just occurred to me while he was speaking. The noble Lord made it clear when speaking to his amendment that it would be helpful if I were to refer to Amendment No. 26 at this point. The intention is to ask the Government whether any of the non-biometric information could comprise sensitive personal data as defined in the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000039"></a>The Minister will know from our discussions on other Bills, including those on the Identity Cards Act last year, that we have always been keen to discover which personal data will be registered. Of course, by its nature any registration of biometrics is going to register personal information&#151;it cannot do anything else&#151;but we want to be sure that it will not include any sensitive personal data as defined in the Data Protection Act.

Limiting the information which can be recorded on the document in this way would mean that the United Kingdom could not use the biometric immigration document provisions to comply with the requirements of a forthcoming European Commission regulation. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to that. That regulation will require the United Kingdom and other member states to include certain non-biometric information on a biometric document when a person is allowed to stay in the United Kingdom, other than that listed in the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000041"></a>At present, the information recorded on existing non-biometric vignette-type residence permits is set out in an EC regulation which we must comply with. The vignettes already include information which is not on the list in the proposed amendment including nationality and sex of the holder, country issuing the document, details of when the document was issued and when it expires, and various security features.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000042"></a>In the near future, a draft EC regulation will also require the documents which we issue to authorise a person to stay in the United Kingdom to contain biometric information including fingerprints and a photograph, and some other additional non-biometric features such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation symbol for a machine readable document with a microchip. Discussions as to what non-biometric information will be required are continuing at EU level.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000043"></a>Clause 5(2)(d) allows us the flexibility to take account of discussions in the European Union on what non-biometric information should be included on the forthcoming biometric residence permit. It is almost certain that the draft EC regulation will require other information which is not included in the proposed amendments. We cannot agree to the amendment because it would take away the flexibility to make regulations which ensure that we comply with requirements of the draft EC regulation.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000044"></a>The noble Baroness drew Amendment No. 26 into the debate, for which I am grateful. This amendment would undermine the operation of the biometric registration provisions for many categories of those who apply for leave, and would prevent us using the biometric immigration document to comply with the regulation to which I referred.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000045"></a>Sensitive personal data include information about a person&#146;s nationality, their religious and political beliefs, sexuality or criminal convictions. When a person applies for leave to remain as, for example, a refugee, a minister of religion, a spouse or a civil partner, they already provide &#147;sensitive&#148; personal data as an essential part of their application.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000046"></a>The Borders and Immigration Agency is well used to processing this type of information fully in accordance with the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. In time, a person who applies for leave to remain will have to apply at the same time for a biometric immigration document. The document will be the way in which their leave is granted. The applicant will have to fill in a combined application form including details about

The amendment would mean that the combined application form could not contain any reference to the leave application if it was in a category which necessarily disclosed the person&#146;s sensitive information, for example an application made on the basis of marriage. This would prevent BIDs being issued to individuals in these categories, even though EC law will require us to issue them with a biometric card wherever we grant them leave.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000047"></a>The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State asking the person for details of their previous criminal convictions as part of a combined application for leave to remain and for a biometric immigration document. That would prevent the Secretary of State from assessing whether it was appropriate to grant leave, and so issue the BID, in the light of the applicant&#146;s previous convictions. This could potentially have very serious implications for public safety, as I am sure the noble Baroness understands.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000048"></a>I reassure her that the Data Protection Act 1998 and Article 8 of the ECHR provide safeguards for those who are required to provide sensitive personal information. For that reason we argue that the amendments are unnecessary.</p>

On the other hand, we have been trying all along to limit the total freedom granted to the Secretary of State in every clause and which goes far beyond the limited requirements that the Minister outlined in answer to our amendments.

If he says that that is not enough because the Secretary of State may think of some non-biometric information some years down the line which he may want to add, and that my suggestion will prevent him from doing that, I would say that that would be a good thing, because any such change of policy would have to be fairly remarkable to give rise to such a requirement, and it would be right for the Secretary of State to return to Parliament on that occasion to ask for fresh primary legislation. I certainly hope that before we leave Grand Committee we will have some sort of an answer from the Minister, so that we can consider what our attitude will be when the matter comes up again on Report.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070552000208"></a> Clause 5, page 3, line 33, leave out paragraph (e)</p>
</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000056"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 16 and 17. I note that the Government have helpfully tabled some amendments in the group.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000057"></a>The object of the amendments is to restrict the Secretary of State&#146;s wide powers to do almost anything she wishes with people&#146;s private information. I wrote the speaking notes before the recent changes in government personnel, so yesterday I very carefully changed my &#147;he&#148;s to &#147;she&#148;s. The amendments build on our previous debates led by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about the problems that may arise as a result of the way the Government plan to impose this system of immigration control.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000058"></a>Clauses 5 to 15 set out the powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring anyone subject to immigration control to apply for the issue of a biometric immigration document. Persons subject to immigration control are those who require leave to remain in the United Kingdom, whether or not they have leave to remain.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000059"></a>We believe that the scope of the registration regulations is extremely broad. The bulk of the detail will be  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contained in the regulations made by the Secretary of State. These regulations can include such open-ended obligations as requiring the use of a document where a question arises about a person&#146;s status in relation to nationality or immigration&#151;we have had some debate about that&#151;in Clause 5(2)(b)(iii), and requiring a person who produces the document to produce other information for comparison. That is in Clause 5(1)(c).</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000060"></a>We have also seen that there is potentially unlimited scope on what information can be required. Regulations can make provision about the content of the document, which, as we have seen from previous groups, can include non-biometric information, and allow for the document to be combined with other documents, as in Clause 5(2)(e). They can also require the document holder to notify the Secretary of State at any time stipulated by regulations and require the surrender of the document or any other documents, as in Clause 5(2(i)(j) and (k).</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000061"></a>Sanctions for failure to comply with any of the regulations can be severe. While the financial penalty is limited in Clause 9(3) to a &#163;1,000 fine&#151;that seems quite high&#151;more drastic steps can be taken, such as the cancellation of leave to remain in the UK. Clause 8 provides a direct link between the information contained on the document and the information that will be held on the national identity register, created by the Identity Cards Act 2006. This allows for regulations to include provision to permit the use of information for specified purposes not relating to immigration, as in Clause 8(2), and provides that there is no need to destroy information if it is retained in accordance with other enactments, as in Clause 8(4).</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000062"></a>Therefore, the potential scope of regulations is extremely broad. They can theoretically force any non-EEA person to provide unlimited information for unlimited purposes. For example, regulations made under Clause 5(2)(d) could require that any person required to apply should provide detailed information about their medical history&#151;we have had a slight reference to that&#151;which could then be used for purposes which have nothing to do with immigration control.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000063"></a>Our amendments have been tabled specifically to require the Government to justify such wide powers. We believe it is important for that to be clearly on the record so that the House may refer to it when the Government later tables any secondary legislation to put the powers in these clauses into effect. We have already heard from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about the limitations on the powers of the House regarding statutory instruments being brought forward.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000064"></a>Amendment No. 15 therefore removes from the Bill the permission to combine biometric immigration documents with other documents. We accept that there may be a rationale for that, but the clause as drafted is vague. It would allow Ministers wide powers so that biometric documents could be combined with almost any other document and used for almost any purpose.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000065"></a>Amendment No. 16 would remove the right of the Secretary of State to demand the surrender of other documents on the issuing of a biometric immigration document. Again, our main objection to the current drafting of the clause is its vagueness. It could entitle the Secretary of State to acquire all manner of documents  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that are not necessarily relevant to a person&#146;s immigration or employment status. It is important that the Minister should explain how and why this power is compliant with the provisions of the Data Protection Act. Amendment No. 17 would limit the occasions on which a person in possession of a biometric document must notify the Secretary of State about a change in circumstances. The changes that would need to be notified should be limited to the following: change of address, change of name, or loss or theft of the document. All of our amendments, but particularly Amendment No. 15, would limit the use of biometric immigration documents to their stated purpose of tackling illegal working and other immigration offences.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000066"></a>When we began consideration of the Bill, noble Lords received a letter from the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General, dated 22 June. She stated that government amendments would be tabled shortly. I appreciate that there was a hiatus because of government changes and ministerial appointments, so we did not see the government amendments until just before we entered this Grand Committee. That is unusual, because normally noble Lords have up to a week&#146;s sight of government amendments, but sometimes only six days&#146;. The noble and learned Baroness said in her letter that two amendments would specify in the Bill in more detail the circumstances in which the Home Secretary can suspend or cancel a biometric immigration document and would be more explicit about the circumstances in which the holder of a biometric immigration document is to notify the Secretary of State of a change in circumstances.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000067"></a>The noble and learned Baroness also stated that she would table an amendment to make it clear in the Bill that the reference requiring the surrender of other documents on the issuing of a biometric immigration document is intended to mean only immigration-related documents. When we then saw the text of the amendments, I looked particularly at Amendment No. 16B&#151;which the Minister will soon speak to&#151;which, at first sight, appears to be very helpful indeed. It is, as the Minister would expect, always my practice before accepting a government amendment that appears to be a concession to consult my honourable friends in another place. I managed to have a brief word with my honourable friend Damian Green this morning, but as it was at our biweekly tea meeting, he could not give proper consideration to the matter. We scanned it together and accepted that at first sight it seemed helpful, while giving the Government the catch-all in subsection (l), where the Government can add anything else that they like&#151;we are used to seeing that kind of get-out clause from the Government. It seemed to cover the eventualities that we had anticipated should be here.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000068"></a>The list looks good, but between now and Report stage we have to hear what the Minister says about the rationale, and we have to have further consideration of the possible consequences to see whether any are going to be disproportionate or if there are any gaps that should be stated in the Bill rather than left to subsection (l). The Government have made considerable progress. I want to hear what the Minister says, but I reserve the right to come back on Report if need be. I hope that in respect of two of my amendments that  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may not be the case, but I think I will still have difficulty with Amendment No. 15. Perhaps the noble Lord will wave the magic Harry Potter wand and persuade me. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000069"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07070552000264"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am sure that we all have a difficulty with the point raised in Amendment No. 15, which relates to the paragraph that allows the BID to be combined with another document. That is also the subject of a later amendment in the Minister&#146;s name. I have been curious all along to know what these other documents could possibly be, because no clue is given in the Explanatory Notes. Again, this is not the first time during the proceedings that I have been rather critical of the Explanatory Notes, which do not come up to the usual standard. However, the difficulties we have had with the notes will be covered in one of the letters the Minister has undertaken to write during the course of the Grand Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="07070552000231"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000070"></a>The only mention of the combination of the BID with another document in the Public Bill Committee was made in relation to the government amendment which added what is now Clause 5(4). The Minister explained that the BID would be designated as an identity card under the Identity Cards Act 2006 because under Section 16 of that Act, a person can be compelled to produce the BID as someone who is liable to compulsory registration.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000071"></a>In passing, I have to point out that although compulsory registration is the expression used in the Identity Cards Act, no mention of registration is made in the text of this Bill. Indeed, I have already mentioned this to the Minister, but have elicited no response from him. If he wants to put the matter beyond doubt, it would be prudent to add to the end of Clause 5(4) words making it clear that an application for a BID under Clause 5(1)(a) is to be treated as compulsory registration under Section 16 of the Identity Cards Act. As usual, I do not expect the Minister to give an immediate answer to this suggestion any more than I do for the other suggestions I have made during the course of our proceedings this afternoon because I would prefer him to take it away and discuss it with his officials and then let me have a considered view in good time.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000072"></a>However, that still leaves me to wonder with what other document the Secretary of State would want to combine the BID under this paragraph. If it is a document which is necessary to make the BID fit for purpose as an ID card, why not say so? How have the Government managed to overcome an objection raised in the other place by Mr Liam Byrne to an amendment similar to this one which he said,</p>
<ul><a name="07070552000224"></a>&#147;would prevent us from effectively designating a document as an ID card, because it would be impossible for us to roll the data over&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, UK Borders Bill Committee, 8/3/07; col. 240.]</ul>
<p><a name="07070552000196"></a>I have studied carefully what honourable Members have said in Standing Committee in the other place and I can well understand the anxiety that was expressed over the breadth of paragraph (h), which requires,</p>
<ul><a name="07070552000225"></a>&#147;the holder of a biometric immigration document to notify the Secretary of State in specified circumstances&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07070552000197"></a>The Minister said that the intention was to require notification of circumstances that could affect the holder&#146;s permitted leave to remain. Government Amendment No. 16B details some of the cases, but I am sorry to note that at the end they give themselves a catch-all exemption by allowing other provisions to be added, which rather spoils the effect of the rest of the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000073"></a>The example given by the Mr Liam Byrne, the Minister in the other place, was a curious one&#151;it was of a Muslim minister of religion. Personally, I wish to encourage greater use by Muslim communities in this country of the training of imams over here, and I was glad to see that last month the Government invested an extra &#163;1 million in this, and have designated Islamic studies as a strategic subject within our universities. The import of foreign imams, many of whom speak no English, encourages Muslim communities to keep themselves separate from the rest of the population, whereas British imams serve the wider interests of their communities because they have a good understanding of society as a whole. But if an imam has come here from Pakistan, as in Mr Byrne&#146;s example, he will have been recorded as entering under the category of &#147;minister of religion&#148;, and there will be no change in his status from then onwards. I recall a case some time ago where a Sikh who had entered the United Kingdom in some other capacity was then elected as a priest by his gurdwara, but was then refused leave to remain as a minister of religion because there is no provision in the rules for a person who has not previously worked as a minister of religion to change his status in that way. I refer noble Lords to Rule 174A of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000074"></a>Therefore, I have to say that it was not clear to me what the circumstances were that Mr Byrne had in mind; but accepting that it is occasionally possible for a person to change from one status to another under the Immigration Rules, and that the rules may be amended from time to time, I suggest that we might add to the words in Amendment No. 17 a further provision requiring the holder of a BID to notify the Secretary of State when there is any change in his status under the Immigration Rules. Even this is a bit of gold-plating, because the immigration status of a person can change only if the Secretary of State grants permission, so the Secretary of State would already be aware of that change. Thus, for instance, a person who entered the United Kingdom as a proposed civil partner, and is then given two years leave to remain in that capacity, will have had to convince the Secretary of State that each of the 10 conditions in Rule 295D have been satisfied; so the Secretary of State will be well aware of his change of status.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000075"></a>The government amendments elucidate some of the conundrums in this clause though by no means all of them, and we are grateful to the noble Baroness&#151;the former Minister responsible&#151;for her letter explaining that these amendments are largely the result of the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers should be aligned with their equivalents in the Identity Cards Act. The addition of the words at the end of paragraph (k) prevents the Secretary of State confiscating,  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for example, a person&#146;s diary or address book. Amendment No. 16B helpfully spells out the cases in which the Secretary of State may cancel a BID, and partially satisfies our curiosity about the BID holder&#146;s responsibility to notify the Secretary of State. I have a couple of questions on how paragraph (e) is supposed to operate. How will the hundreds of thousands of BID holders know that the Secretary of State has specified some additional circumstance requiring notification; what will be the penalties when a person to whom this circumstance applies fails to notify the Secretary of State, and will it be a defence to say that he was unaware of the new specification that had just been introduced?</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000076"></a>Finally, I have a question about Amendment 19A. Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 is indeed the authority under which the rules are made. Is this deletion because the words are otiose?</p>

<p><a name="07070552000077"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070552000265"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I raise a point about Amendment No. 16 which I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has not already covered while I was briefly out of the room. Paragraph (k) refers to the Secretary of State requiring the &#147;surrender of other documents&#148;. &#147;Other documents&#148; is not explained, even in the Explanatory Notes. Does it include passports held by non-nationals which are still valid? If they are included and the Secretary of State acts on this, people could be left in a position of quasi-statelessness in this country, which would prevent them travelling to other countries.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000078"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070552000266"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> It might be helpful if I comment on that. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is right to raise that question. He is getting at some of the issues that I tried to raise. I was trying to find out what other documents the Government might require to be surrendered. The noble Lord will be aware that during the passage of the Identity Cards Act we discussed at what time a passport would have to be surrendered in order for someone to be forced to have an ID card. What about the designation of other documents such as driving licences? What would have to be surrendered? I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for raising that point.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000080"></a>Amendment No. 15 would fundamentally undermine one of the aims of the biometric registration scheme. We want to ensure that foreign nationals subject to immigration control and legally in the United Kingdom are issued with a biometric immigration document. These documents will act also as an identity card once they have been designated under the Identity Cards Act. If Clause 5(2)(e) were removed, the biometric immigration document could not be combined with an ID card. Therefore, when the Secretary of State decides to designate biometric immigration documents for the purposes of registration under the Identity Cards Act 2006, foreign nationals affected would have to carry two cards.</p>

If one can designate with the ID card, there is no question of it being combined with another document, unless the Minister is saying that there is a blank identity card and the BID is merged into it. Why do the Government need to do this? Can they not simply designate the existing BID as an identity card under the Identity Cards Act?</p>

<p><a name="07070552000082"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070552000269"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> It will not be the existing BID that is designated as a document; it will be the second generation that becomes ID cards.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000083"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 16. The purpose of Clause 5(2)(k) is to enable the Border and Immigration Agency to require the surrender of old, less secure documents which currently serve as evidence of immigration status, such as immigration status letters&#151;which can be forged&#151;or vignettes. Our intention is to replace them with the secure biometric immigration document. Bleeding out insecure documents is a key contributor to tackling illegal working. Our intention is significantly to reduce the number of acceptable immigration documents issued by the Border and Immigration Agency to the biometric-enabled visa and the biometric immigration document.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000084"></a>Representatives from the NCP stated in the public evidence sessions in another place that good employers want us to reduce the number of different documents issued to foreign nationals granted leave in the United Kingdom. We intend to reduce these to two types of secure document: the biometric-enabled visa and a biometric immigration document. It has always been our intention only to require the surrender of immigration- related documents, which would include vignettes granting leave. We have therefore tabled Amendment No. 15A to make this clear in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000085"></a>Noble Lords will know that we have tabled Amendments Nos. 16A, 16B, and 19A, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred, to address some of the concerns emanating from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in respect of insufficient detail about the biometric registration scheme in the Bill. The noble Baroness has very honourably consulted a colleague in another place, Damian Green, and I fully understand why she cannot give a firmer commitment on the points covered by the amendments today. I respect her need to reflect further on their content.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000086"></a>The amendments set out in the Bill more detail about when the Secretary of State may cancel a biometric immigration document and when a holder may be required to notify the Secretary of State. However, they also reflect the fact that circumstances change and, for this reason, it is necessary to allow for additional circumstances to be specified in regulations, which will of course be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000087"></a>The proposed changes are designed to follow more closely the comparable provisions in the Identity Cards Act. There are certain differences because of the different immigration functions of the biometric immigration document. There will no longer be a power to suspend a biometric immigration document, because it is no longer needed.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000089"></a>The government amendments address the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s concern about the circumstances in which the holder of a biometric immigration document would be required to notify the Secretary of State. We would clearly prefer this approach to Amendment No. 17, which could mean that the Secretary of State held out-of-date information about some biometric immigration document holders and their entitlements in the UK, and that the biometric immigration documents contained inaccurate information.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made some comments about the purpose of allowing a biometric immigration document to be combined with another document. I am happy to give some further consideration to what he said. I have already explained some of the detail about the types of document that the Secretary of State will require to be surrendered. We may well require individuals to surrender their passport to enable an existing vignette or stamp to be cancelled, with the passport being returned when the BID is issued to replace the old vignette or stamp. Those are the sorts of circumstances in which we might want to do that.</p>

A great many people never look at the news. What happens when the person who is required to notify the Secretary of State under some change specified in the Bill fails to do so?

<ul><a name="07070552000226"></a>&#147;we have been clear in our intention to designate the cards as ID cards as soon as the national identity register comes online. That is important, because doing so will provide migrants who are here legitimately with the additional protections on which Parliament rightly insisted in the Identity Cards Act 2006. The second problem is that if we accepted the amendment, migrants in this country with biometric immigration documents would have several bits of identity. That is problematic, because the whole thrust of our policy is to bleed out those documents&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, UK Borders Bill Committee, 8/3/07; cols. 240-41].</ul>

Mr Byrne, the Minister in another place, told the Public Bill Committee that the BID would be designated under the Identity Cards Act as an identity card, whereas the Bill says that the Government want to merge the BID into another document. I asked the Minister whether that meant that there would be a blank identity card into which the BID would be merged. That was my hypothetical explanation for that provision. The Minister did not answer that question. My noble friend tried to repeat the question by quoting Mr Byrne. How does the Minister reconcile what Mr Byrne said in the Public Bill Committee with what the Bill says about merging the BID with another document? He need answer not now but some time.</p>

The wording would be much improved if it said, &#147;if the Secretary of State is satisfied&#148;.

I remember a brief that I had five years ago. It was one of those occasions on which the Leader gives you the good news that you have a fascinating new brief&#151;home affairs. The other news is that the first Bill is in 10 days and it is an immigration Bill. That was the 2002 Bill. I admit to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that when I saw similar government drafting in that Bill, I tabled a series of amendments on exactly the same lines as his. I was not trying to be helpful at all to the Government. I did not see this at all as a matter of linguistics or drafting, but as a way of trying to ensure that there was a much tighter way of looking at the whole procedure and holding the Secretary of State to account. It is often very healthy to ensure that, if the Secretary of State takes powers to himself, it is a matter not of what he thinks but of being satisfied so that he provides evidence. I know that we have had this argument for the past five years and that we will keep returning to it. I am sure that the Government, like all Governments, want drafting that removes so far as possible any possible element of legal challenge to the action taken by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000105"></a>I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, but I am particularly grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Dholakia, who have tried to assist the Government to reconcile two statements. I am glad that they did, because that was the absolute intention behind my Amendment No. 15. I became extremely confused when the Minister talked about the way in which the identity card would supersede the BID, because I am not sure that this is a matter of language. It could be a substantive difference in process, and I do not think that the Government mean it to be. My understanding is that combining documents means that the two documents are different and are put together. The Minister explained initially that there would be one document&#151;the BID&#151;which would be discarded later and superseded. If one document is superseded, the first is discarded. New technology comes in and we have the biometric immigration

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000106"></a>There is certainly confusion in my mind. It may simply be that there is misunderstanding on this side of the Committee, but I suspect that there is not. I suspect that we may simply need to consider better drafting, or perhaps the Government will pursue a process of rolling out ID cards to which some may object. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and I may find ourselves on different sides of the argument at that stage. I may support the Government in the way in which they want to roll out identity documents for those who are subject to immigration control. Whatever our view, however, we need to know what the process is and whether it will be effective and proportionate.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000107"></a>I am grateful to the Minister. As I said, I will consider the Government&#146;s responses to my Amendments Nos. 16 and 17.

<p><a name="07070552000110"></a>The noble Lord said: I put on record my gratitude to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for their observations on Clause 5(3)(e) and (f), which prompted us to reconsider the paragraphs. We tabled Amendment No. 17A in response. The committee recommended following Section 126 of the 2002 Act in specifying in the Bill that PACE codes will apply to authorised persons registering biometrics. However, having looked carefully at the PACE codes, we do not consider them to be appropriate for the biometric registration provisions in this Bill. Indeed, there is no provision in the Identity Cards Act 2006 that requires authorised persons to have regard to a code when registering a person&#146;s biometric samples, such as fingerprints. This is because we did not want the legislation to have a sense of criminality, or for applicants to feel that they were being treated as citizens under suspicion.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000111"></a>The same therefore applies to this legislation, as it is not our intention to criminalise foreign nationals, but simply to issue secure, reliable documents establishing their immigration status and identity. For this reason, my amendment removes references to a code. However, we want to ensure that the process of registering biometrics is carried out properly. We will publish practice guidance to which persons authorised to register biometrics must adhere. For those reasons, I beg to move.</p>

He repeated what we have already been told by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, in her letter, when she explained that this matter was to do with the point raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the purpose was to follow the Identity Cards Act more closely. Removing these two paragraphs means, as the Minister has explained, that the code to which authorised persons must have regard has disappeared. The Minister simply told your Lordships that this would be replaced by practice guidance. What the code might have contained and what the practice guidance might contain could have been identical. Neither of them would necessarily have referred to the PACE codes of practice. The replacement of the code by practice guidance does not have any bearing on the explanation which the Minister, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, gave us in the letter. I am left slightly uncertain as to why simply replacing the code by practice guidance has the effect which the Minister explained in the letter and again this afternoon.</p>

However, if a person wants to stay here for six months or less, they will not have to apply for a BID, at any rate initially. The Minister in another place said that there had been debates about whether that period should be reduced to three months, but so far as I know, those discussions have taken place behind closed doors in the Home Office and not in either House of Parliament. We would like to know what the arguments are for reducing the period from six to three months and we would like to be given a chance to join the discussion.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000130"></a>The vast majority of ordinary tourists come here for three months or less, so it would be hugely expensive to force them all to get BIDs unless the Government are planning to make the holders pay for them, which might be something of a damper on the tourist market. This is the first occasion on which I have had to ask the question: is there any suggestion that persons applying for BIDs will be charged, and will the charging regime be what it has been in some other cases recently, where the Government have been putting up the fees; that is, charging a sum that recovers more than the total cost of providing the service? What is the estimated cost of the document and how exactly is it to be paid for? Also, where has the discussion about three months or six months got to? Does the Minister agree that when we reach the Report stage, we should add words to Clause 5 to provide that no one who is given leave to enter the UK for six months or less will be asked to apply for a BID? Rather, if it is necessary, the Secretary of State could, by order subject to the approval of Parliament, require the period to be reduced from six months to three.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000131"></a>The Minister, Mr Byrne, also said in the Public Bill Committee that UKvisas would not issue BIDs because they were only for long-term entrants. That is a non sequitur. There are several categories for which initial leave to enter may be for longer than six months and for which it might make sense for UKvisas to do the job. Although its performance has been abysmal, the latest report by the UK entry certificate monitor shows that it has been making improvements.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000132"></a>It would make sense for UK monitors to issue BIDs for investors, persons wanting to establish a business, innovators, writers, composers or artists, who can be initially admitted for two years, so that the BIDs could be issued together with their visa in their country of origin. Other categories for which that would be appropriate are retired persons of independent means and&#151;the largest category of all&#151;students coming to attend courses at our universities, who are given leave to enter for more than the six months that we discussed earlier. Like the other medium-term entrants mentioned, they will all have to be fingerprinted for their biometric visa. Polishing off the BID at the same time would save trouble and expense. Universities are already voicing concern about the UK becoming less competitive, and we should be doing everything possible to reduce the bureaucracy faced by overseas students, which can be a strong deterrent.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000133"></a>I entirely agree with what my honourable friend the Member for Rochdale said about the past performance of UKvisas. Maybe the answer would be to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring UKvisas to accept applications for BIDs for categories to be determined by order. I am trying to be helpful and to reduce the work required to issue the BIDs. I hope that the Minister will find this a useful suggestion. I do not expect an immediate answer, but I hope that, in the course of our proceedings, he will be able to discuss it with his officials and let me have his views. I beg to move.</p>

Biometric immigration documents, on the other hand, will be issued in the United Kingdom, initially to foreign nationals, those subject to immigration control who have made a successful in-country application to the Border and Immigration Agency. However, in future, that may include other foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control. Fees for in-country services are set by the Secretary of State with the consent of the Treasury, and the regulations prescribing those fees are laid before Parliament and are subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000136"></a>We consider that that offers Parliament sufficient scrutiny and oversight of the costs of biometric immigration documents and the fees that may be charged without the need for a code of practice. So, we anticipate that the majority of applications for the initial allocation of biometric immigration documents will be processed alongside immigration applications and completed within existing published service levels. Obviously, some cases may take longer for a variety of reasons, and that will include cases in which we have to make further inquiries.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000137"></a>We do not consider it necessary to have a code of practice setting service levels and maximum costs for issuing biometric documents, given the wide-ranging and complex nature of the applications we process. As I have made plain, those making an application will be charged and that will be included in the immigration application charge fee. I cannot provide the noble Lords with precise details, but I am happy to write in response to the general fall-out of questions put to me today to which I have not been able to provide direct answers.</p>

On the cost of biometric immigration documents, we are developing a cost base for these and a charging model to recover them. We are determined to keep the cost of BIDs as low as possible, but it would not be appropriate to commit to an artificial limit&#151;certainly not at this stage. As I have explained, costs and fees will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

We have been approached by representatives of the Refugee Council about the impact of this. Does the Minister consider it would be appropriate to provide an exemption from fees for asylum seekers, bearing in mind that this group is one of the poorest and most vulnerable in our society? Asylum seekers are unable to work and receive less financial support than British citizens. This should be regarded as a question of humanitarian protection, and asylum seekers should be exempted from the charges on a discretionary basis. I hope that the Minister will be able to consider this. It would be helpful if a response were made before the Report stage so that we can narrow any future amendment on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000140"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070552000294"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Could the Minister deal with my question on whether the basis on which the fees are charged will be on the costs incurred by the providers or whether, as is the case for certain other fees recently, the charges will be higher than the costs? I refer to the fee to apply for indefinite leave to remain which was raised recently from &#163;350 to &#163;750. I ask the question because UK universities are already anxious about competition from abroad diminishing the supply of foreign students entering our universities and thus having a severe impact on their finances. If applicants to higher education courses are suddenly faced with a large additional bill for BIDs, that could have a serious effect on university intake.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000141"></a>Before the Government reach any conclusion on these issues, I would ask them to hold discussions with the universities, and I would be grateful for an assurance from the Minister that that will be so. Further, since he said that no decision has been made on whether to reduce the period from six months to three, I extend that request also to representatives of the tourist industry. If you start charging people for BIDs when they are coming in only for a short holiday, I am sorry to say that the impact on our tourist industry could be very severe. It would be outrageous if the Government were to undertake such a step without proper consultation with the interests concerned. I hope that the noble Lord can give me assurances, on both the universities and the representatives of the tourist industry, and that they will hold those discussions before any final decisions are made on these matters.</p>

That is a six-month period, which is fairly lengthy. I cannot believe that this will have a serious impact on the tourist industry. We have made a lot of improvements over recent years on processing visas. It is timely and quick, and it is one of the fastest large-scale visa-issuing operations in the world. Over 90 per cent of all straightforward visas are issued within 24 hours. That compares extremely favourably with all other visa-issuing authorities; it is one of the best.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000143"></a>I want to make the point about refugee status clear. When a recognised refugee is granted leave and is issued with a BID for the first time, they will not be charged. They may be charged when that BID is later renewed, when it expires after 10 years. There is not going to be the problem that the noble Lord envisaged.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000144"></a>On the point about UK universities, I expect that we would consult them in any event. We consult them in detail about students, and they do not always agree with us, but we go through that process. As I understand it, our rates are very competitive internationally, which is one reason why we continue to be one of the favoured destinations for students across the world who come to study out of their home country.</p>

However, I hear what the noble Earl says, and if I have anything further to offer for clarification I will do so, but this is not quite the problem that the Committee imagine.</p>

I want to add to the list of bodies that I hope the Government will consult before finalising the arrangements. They should include the Refugee Council. Surely that is a reasonable thing to ask, considering that there may be people who come within the sphere of interest of the Refugee Council who may need to apply for BIDs. When they come to the end of the process and are granted asylum, they will not have a large sum of money at their disposal, and it may be unreasonable to ask them to suddenly cough up.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000148"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has pointed out to me, there may be also a backlog of old cases that will need to be dealt with, and we need to ensure that they are dealt with fairly and that people do not suddenly find themselves in financial difficulties as a result of the imposition of these requirements. I am grateful for the assurance that the Government will consult the UK universities. I hope that they will also consult the tourist industry and the Refugee Council,

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070552000218"></a> Clause 7, page 5, line 23, leave out &#147;In particular,&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000154"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 21 arose from discussions I had with the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium. I was looking at some of its amendments. Peculiarity struck me&#151;I suppose one could say&#151;when looking at Clause 7. My amendment would remove the words &#147;in particular&#148;. I am trying to get an idea of why that phrase is required. Clause 7 makes provision for the effect of non-compliance by those who fail to comply with the biometric registration rules.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000155"></a>The Bill gives an initial list of those punishments that may be applied by regulations. Officials would be empowered to do the following: refuse an application for a biometric immigration document; refuse an application or claim in connection with immigration; cancel the variation of leave to enter or remain in the UK; require the Secretary of State to consider whether she should give a notice under Section 9; and provide for the consequence of a failure to be at the discretion of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000156"></a>The clause is drafted so that these are the punishments that may be applied. I am trying to see whether that list covers every eventuality. It seems to&#151;especially that last part. My amendment has been tabled to ask the Minister to explain what other punishments the Government consider they might need to add by regulations in the future that could not adequately already be covered by that list of examples. Subsection (2) is introduced by the words,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070552000219"></a>&#147;In particular, the regulations may&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070552000200"></a>do all this. If that is the particular, what else we be added on? Could it be something so controversial that it really would not be appropriate for it to be added by regulations? I want to try to get a feel at this stage for what else the Government might seek to do in the future. The issue was not addressed in another place. I beg to move.</p>

I dread to think of what the Government might have in mind to add to them. I treat this as a very important subject. When you are talking about hundreds of thousands of people in possession of BIDs&#151;in the end that could run into millions&#151;the accidental failure to comply with requirement regulations is a point that needs to be seriously considered. The Secretary of State appears

I may be wrong on that; I have not seen one in the Bill, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000158"></a>A new requirement is imposed and half a million people are supposed to comply with it. Suppose only a handful, say a few dozen, are not aware of the announcements which the Minister has assured us will be widely disseminated through television and other means, and, as far as possible, through direct communication with the holders of BIDs. As the noble Lord will be aware, the postal system is not 100 per cent reliable, and people change addresses. There are bound to be people who do not receive direct communication and therefore will fail to comply with some requirement of the regulations through inadvertence and through no fault of their own. Would it be a defence to a charge of failure to comply that the person was not aware of the notification or did not receive it? I was not sure exactly what the Minister replied to that.</p>
<h5><a name="07070552000235"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000159"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, to remove the words &#147;in particular&#148; is absolutely necessary because we have no idea what further regulations might be contemplated under this clause. The list that we have here is bad enough and I foresee all kinds of errors arising from, as I say, nothing to do with mala fides or wishing to evade the regulations but simply through omission. I take this extremely seriously and I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000160"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07070552000301"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for tabling the amendment because the explanation is very simple. As the clause stands, the consequences of failing to comply with a requirement of regulations made under the biometric registration provisions are set out. The clause also gives the Secretary of State the discretion to decide which of the listed consequences is appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case. Therefore, one could argue that it is graduated.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000161"></a>The existing provisions do not give the Secretary of State a power to impose sanctions, other than the ones listed in Clause 7(2). I reassure the Committee that it is not our intention that the Secretary of State should be able to use any other sanction, other than the ones already listed in Clause 7(2).</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked where there might be a right of appeal to. I refer him to Clause 11, which covers penalties and appeals. I think that he will find the answer there. For immigration matters he should refer to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000163"></a>Finally, before the Secretary of State imposes a sanction, he or she&#151;she at present&#151;will, of course, consider all relevant circumstances. That will include reasons why the person did not comply. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, focused on that point earlier. It has to be right that sanctions will not be imposed unreasonably. Therefore, a test of reasonableness will be in place.</p>

He is trying to say that the drafting of Clause 7(2) is intended to deliver what I want&#151;a closed list and not an open list. The noble Lord agrees with that. The difficulty is that my experience of our discussions on a similar drafting in the context of the Serious Crime Bill earlier this year led me to believe that the words &#147;in particular&#148; would result in an open list, not a closed list, and would give the Government the opportunity to extend the list of punishments later by regulation.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000165"></a>Will the Minister and Home Office officials look at our consideration of Schedule 6 to the Serious Crime Bill? That gives permission for the Secretary of State to extend the purposes for which data matching may take place. As originally drafted, the Serious Crime Bill gave examples of the purposes which might be added. The Government agreed to my request that the words &#147;in particular&#148; should be knocked out because that restricted the list from being one of examples&#151;an open list&#151;to being a closed list. That is where my confusion arises. The Minister is trying to say, &#147;You&#146;ve got what you want here&#148;, but I am saying, &#147;I don&#146;t think I have if what we did in the Serious Crime Bill delivered what I required in that instance&#148;. I appreciate that this appears to be semantics, but it is not intended to be. It might be helpful if I talk to the Minister between now and Report. I hope that there will be a way of resolving the matter. We may need to consider the progress of the Serious Crime Bill in another place because the drafting of these Bills needs to be consistent. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000169"></a>The Government believe that it is just as important to ensure that children have secure documents as evidence of their immigration status as adults. One of the many objectives for the registration of biometrics is to assist our law enforcement activities against human trafficking and exploitation. We had a significant debate on that only last week, led by noble Lords from the opposition parties. It was very helpful indeed. Enforcement was one of the issues that arose in that debate. We want to tackle the problem head on, and have stated our clear commitment to dealing with matters such as human trafficking, particularly of children who can

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000170"></a>As a matter of policy, we would not want to issue penalty notices against children who are unable or unwilling to comply with a requirement of the legislation. It is therefore right that a responsible adult is held accountable for the non-compliance of a child in their care. The amendment is also comparable to a provision in the Identity Cards Act that would enable the Secretary of State to designate certain adults to assume responsibility for the obligations imposed on children under the Act, should regulations be made to lower the minimum age for registration on the national identity register to children under 16. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000171"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07070552000304"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> We were very grateful for the Minister&#146;s letter, in which he argued that recording biometrics helps to combat human trafficking, particularly of children who may be smuggled into the UK using other children&#146;s identities. The noble Lord rightly repeated that argument, which we take very seriously. We agree that the debate on human trafficking, which your Lordships held last week, was a very useful contribution to the joint working of all parties in all sections of the community in supporting the Government&#146;s actions against trafficking.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000172"></a>The Minister said in that debate, and the noble Lord repeated, that the BID will help us to be certain of children&#146;s identity. In the near future, however, everyone entering the UK from outside the EEA will have a biometric visa; so a child entering openly through a port could not take on another child&#146;s identity at that point. Nor would there be any point in the child&#146;s carers doing so when applying for a BID, as, having entered legitimately, the child would be entitled to a BID in his own right. On the other hand, if the child has entered clandestinely, the trafficker could not obtain a BID for him because his biometrics would not match those on the database, although one must enter the caveat that the EU says that sufficiently reliable technology is not yet available for the one-to-many searches requirement, as I said before.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000173"></a>We agree that a parent or guardian should be given the responsibility for ensuring that the child has a BID, including the process of taking the biometrics for that purpose. Here we return to the question of the minimum age at which it is useful to take a child&#146;s biometrics in the light of the evidence that was given to the Public Bill Committee of the changes that occur in the child&#146;s fingerprints in the years before he reaches the age of 16. I reiterate that the committee was told that this would not have been an issue if the iris had been chosen as the principal biometric, because the iris remains constant from a very early age. It seems that it was decided to go down the fingerprint route because it was convenient for matching up with the police legacy systems. That is very unfortunate because iris technology looks to be the winner in the long run. It has already been adopted successfully by the immigration authorities in Dubai, by the British Airports Authority, and by several other airport authorities around the world to authenticate passengers entering fast-track processes.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000174"></a>As the Bill stands, there will be nothing to prevent us from using iris recognition later on, but as I asked before, is the Home Office doing any work on this so that we are not committed for ever to what may become obsolescent technology?</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000175"></a>The age at which a parent will have to apply for a BID on behalf of a child has not yet been determined, but from our previous discussions it will certainly be less than 16, and it may be as low as five or six. I asked the noble Lord, and perhaps he can tell the Committee, what the age limit is at present for biometric visas in overseas posts. Is it the intention of the Government to align the minimum age requirement for visas and BIDs? Whatever age is chosen as the minimum for biometrics, will there be arguments about age determination similar to those that we have now about whether a child is over or under the age of 18? If the visa and BID minimum age is the same, any disputes would arise in the country of origin, because once the fingerprints of a child had been taken for visa purposes, it would presumably follow that they could be taken for BIDs.</p>

As ever, the noble Lord has come up with some questions to which I do not yet have an answer. In general terms, we need to continue to develop the technologies that the noble Lord referred to, but this is something that, as the noble Lord said, would be practical for development in the future. We intend to keep iris recognition technology under review. However, the provisions in the EU biometric residence permit regulations currently relate only to face and fingerprint recognition.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000177"></a>On double checking, there is a possibility of child X&#151;who is actually child Y&#151;being cared for by one adult, which would be double checked when applying for a BID. That element is there in the way in which this will work. I am happy to consider further the points that the noble Lord has raised. Perhaps it is worth adding that, considering the EC regulation, it will require us to use fingerprint and facial recognition, largely because it is tried and tested and because we have existing databases to check against. We will of course keep our minds open regarding iris recognition technology. The other point was about age. Currently, a child of five or over who applies for a visa is fingerprinted. That is under our existing regulations.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000178"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07070552000306"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My point about age was that we now have arguments about whether a child is over or under the age of 18, but we could be having similar arguments about whether a child is over or under the age that is specified as the minimum for taking fingerprints. A child has to have a BID, as I understand the Minister, if the child is over five or six. Equally, there could be arguments about whether the age of the child is accurately claimed by the parent or guardian. They want to subject this five or six year-old child to the sort of procedures that are now in contemplation for determining whether a child is over or under the age of 18. I hope that is not true, but it is one possibility that is raised by having a very low minimum age at which a child would have to register to get a BID.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000179"></a>We are grateful to the Minister for promising to look further into these matters for us. I do not think that it would be sensible for us to pursue these questions any further at this stage. In conclusion, it would be a very good idea if those who are developing these systems in the Home Office would liaise closely with the Government&#146;s anti-trafficking organisation, which was prominently referred to in the debate that the noble Lord praised. There are, as he rightly pointed out at the beginning of his remarks, some important implications in what we are doing here for what may be developed under the anti-trafficking strategy. I do not think that I need to ask the noble Lord to give me that assurance, as I am sure that it follows without saying that the BID development team will be working closely with those concerned with the anti-trafficking strategy.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000180"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07070552000307"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Indeed, that is the case. It must be right. I tend to think that we could do much more about human trafficking. I believe in effective law enforcement as a discouragement. It will help us in the fight against human trafficking, which is one of the great evils of our time. In the past few months, we have had a lot of debate and discussion about slavery because of the anniversary of Wilberforce&#146;s Act. It is a stain on our nation that trafficking and exploitation of children exists and carries on. It is essential that we have the facility to determine age because, as we have all learnt over the past few years, the age at which young people are exploited in this appalling way can be very young indeed. So this will be a useful tool in our fight against trafficking and exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000186"></a>The noble Lord said: In view of all that I said on Amendment No. 14, which covered very much the whole purpose of this amendment, it would be an intrusion on the Committee&#146;s time if I were to say any more at this juncture. I look forward to the other arguments on the group. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000187"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07070552000309"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> I rise because I have Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 grouped with Amendment No. 23. As has become apparent from our previous debates, we are very concerned about the wide powers that regulations will give Ministers to permit the use of information for specified purposes that are not directly related to immigration. I can be brief; although not quite as brief as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who was exemplary in these matters, but I will try.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000188"></a>First, I will jump to Amendment No. 25. It tried to elicit from the Government very much what they have put in government Amendment No. 23A. We were  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trying to find a list of the purposes for which it would be proper for information to be used. The Government&#146;s list is at variance with ours. However, I shall consider further between now and Report whether it satisfies us. As with the amendment that we dealt with earlier, the fact that we had only 24 hours&#146; notice of it means that my honourable friends have not been able to consider it properly. However, it looks as though it goes a long way towards satisfying us.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000189"></a>Our intention with Amendment No. 24 was to try to prevent fishing expeditions. As has been seen today, the Government are collating more and more personal data across all departments. This is just one part of that exercise. We have already seen in the Serious Crime Bill that the Government are embarking on a very wide piece of work on data matching and data mining. In Amendment No. 24, we are trying to limit the use of the powers in this Bill to circumstances that are already enshrined in legislation and, therefore, in some form or another have already been debated and acceded to by Parliament. So, again, we are trying to look at the range of government powers to see whether they are adequate.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000190"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07070552000310"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Clause 8 provides a link between the information contained on the document and the information that would be held on the national identity register created by the Identity Cards Act 2006. It allows regulations to permit the use of information for specified purposes not related to immigration, and it provides that there is no need to destroy information if it is retained in accordance with other enactments.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000191"></a>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has argued that this could be seen as an intention by the Government to collect data for the purposes of enforcing destitution, such as we were discussing earlier, and denying healthcare in some scenarios, which could breach the UK&#146;s human rights obligations under various international instruments. The JCWI foresees that the effect of the enforced destitution regime of immigration control, coupled with the universal registration of non-EEA nationals before the rest of the population, will lead to a culture where officials routinely demand production of BIDs and people will effectively be compelled to carry them. It believes that a culture of biometric data collection, sharing and checking of associated biometric documentation against registers will mean discrimination against visible minorities in the UK. To some extent, that was confirmed by the discussion that we had earlier, when the Minister did not see anything odd in an employer requiring a person of Somali appearance to produce a BID, although he did to some extent correct himself later on, when he said that national insurance documentation would be perfectly satisfactory if that was available.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070552000192"></a>The JCWI believes that this culture will mean discrimination against visible minorities in the UK. It cites in support of that claim the fact that in several European countries where identity documents are already compulsory ethnic minorities are disproportionately checked. We fear that the same is likely to happen in this country. We fear above all that the introduction of BIDs will systematise the destitution of hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants now surviving in the parallel economy, with disastrous consequences not  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only for the migrants themselves but for the local authorities, charities and faith groups who will have to bear the burden of responding to this widespread destitution in one form or another. It will have a particularly adverse effect in London and other urban areas where migrant populations are disproportionately concentrated. Before the scheme is introduced, I beg the Government to come up with a strategy to deal with the problem. Perhaps the Minister could begin by telling the Committee this afternoon what they propose to do, when BIDs are introduced, about the 100,000 irregular migrants and failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000193"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070552000311"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> I rise, unusually, to remark on the fact that we are approaching 6 pm, and I appreciate that the rules today require that we must, regardless, finish at 6 pm. I observe to the Minister that he has got to speak to his own amendments, and therefore we will do our best to complete our contributions, but we do not wish to be guillotined. We appreciate that if we reach 6 pm and we have not completed this group, or if we have started the next group and have not completed it, we have to suspend, even if we are in the middle of debating an amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07070552000194"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070552000312"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I am concerned about government Amendment No. 23A, in particular subparagraph (d) which, as far as I can see, makes it possible to use information for investigating any offence at all; trivial, mediocre or serious. That is why Amendment No. 25, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is very much needed. It would limit the sharing of information to serious organised crime.</p>

<p><a name="07070558000002"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07070558000028"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords for their contributions, and to my noble friend Lord Judd for starting the debate. The amendment could lead to the clause being interpreted in such a way that the Border and Immigration Agency could not use biometric information collected under regulations made under Clause 5 for non-immigration purposes. Leaving the clause open to interpretation in this way would be undesirable because it would prevent the Border and Immigration Agency using this information for other important purposes, such as to check a fingerprint provided by the police against our databases in order to try to identify and trace an offender. For those reasons and on the grounds of good law enforcement, we must resist the amendment.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000003"></a>On the other hand, government Amendments Nos. 23A and 25F&#151;the latter is a consequential amendment&#151;are very much in the spirit of the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman. Our amendments seek to specify the non-immigration purposes for which biometrics information can be used. Careful consideration has been given to exactly what those purposes might be. For example, Amendment No. 23A ensures that where the police have a fingerprint from a crime scene and ask the Secretary of State to check that fingerprint against fingerprints she holds in order to trace a suspected offender, the Secretary of  


<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC180"></a><b>5 July 2007 : Column GC180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>State can do that. It also allows for biometric information to be checked before a British passport is issued to certain types of British nationals.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000004"></a>I should also make it clear that this amendment ensures that the Border and Immigration Agency can share biometric information by relying on its existing data sharing powers, as long as the regulations provide for this. So Amendment No. 23A also allows the Secretary of State to specify additional uses for the information if these are identified in the future in regulations which will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000005"></a>I want to assure noble Lords that any use of the information collected under these provisions must be in accordance with the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act, because those are fundamental protections. We are right to rely on them because they provide the public with a degree of reassurance. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070558000006"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07070558000029"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I am sure that we have all listened carefully&#151;</p>

In that case, perhaps I may come back with one question. I was rather thrown by the fact that the Minister sought to move his amendment when he cannot do so yet. He is only speaking to it. However, it is late in the afternoon after quite a few hours of debate.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000008"></a>I want to ask one question about new paragraph (f) in government Amendment No. 23A, which states,</p>
<ul><a name="07070558000026"></a>&#147;for such other purposes (whether in connection with functions under an enactment or otherwise) as the regulations may specify&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070558000024"></a>What kind of purposes and functions would have no relation to an enactment? Has the Minister considered that? If not, I am happy for him to write to me. It is the only query I have on this list.</p>

<p><a name="07070558000009"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070558000031"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> As on the previous occasion when we considered government Amendment No. 16B, the effect of spelling out the conditions in paragraphs (a) to (e) is almost entirely spoilt by the addition of paragraph (f). Having set out the various purposes in the first five paragraphs, the Secretary of State is then given carte blanche to do anything she likes, not just in connection with another enactment but with whatever may come to mind. This is the second time we have had an example of this sort. Not only is it incumbent on the Minister to explain what these other purposes are, as the noble Baroness has requested, it is also necessary to explain why such a catch-all is needed at all. Why is the Secretary of State not satisfied with the provisions set out in paragraphs (a) to (e), and what is going through the minds of the draftsmen in the Home Office that might possibly create the need for the additional powers sought in paragraph (f)? If the Minister cannot explain it, other than that paragraph (f) has been added simply because someone thought there may be a need for it at some future date without having anything specific in mind, I think that we will want to delete it at a later stage.</p>

Paragraph (f) simply preserves the Secretary of State&#146;s common law power to share information. That power already exists. This simply seeks to re-establish the status quo, as it were.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked me whether I was about to withdraw my amendment. I do not know why she made that assumption. On the basis of everything that I have said, I should have thought it was most unlikely that I would withdraw my amendment were it not a case of force majeure and the Grand Committee procedures with which we are faced. I wanted to get that on the record.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000012"></a>There is one other thing that I should report to Members of the Committee. I had to visit my office briefly this afternoon. It is extraordinary how these things happen, but quite coincidentally I noticed that among the mail on my desk&#151;I emphasise that this was delivered with the mail this afternoon&#151;was a copy of the Government&#146;s reply to the report on asylum of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I was tempted to seize it and, when I rejoined the Committee, to start to analyse what was in it. However, it seemed to me that that would be too instantaneous a reaction and that I needed to consider very carefully what was in it. However, it will be considered very carefully before we reach the next stage of the Bill. At the moment, I am far from satisfied but because of the procedures I can only assist my noble friend&#151;which in another sense I am glad to do&#151;by withdrawing the amendment.</p>

First, I did not respond to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I think that the noble Lord was unhappy that we can check fingerprints for any offence irrespective of its severity. An offence may not be related to a serious organised crime, for example an isolated murder, but we would want to be able to undertake a check for the police in those circumstances.</p>

<a name="70705-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070558000014"></a>I probably need to put a correction on the record. I may not have made myself sufficiently clear when I responded to questions relating to illegal working. I should make it clear that in those circumstances an employer may ask a prospective employee to produce a number of documents. They include the British passport, a birth certificate or national insurance number combined with another document. I want to ensure that the record is correct. I am concerned that I might have inadvertently given an inaccurate response and therefore I want to make that correction at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="07070558000015"></a><b><a name="70705-gc0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07070558000035"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The point that we were discussing, to which the noble Lord has just replied, is whether the employer would feel obliged by the legislation to

The two effects combined&#151;the existence of these documents, plus the criminal penalties that may be levied against an employer&#151;would be a standing temptation to any employer to safeguard himself by routinely asking for the production of this document, even when a national insurance certificate was already in existence. One would be belt-and-braces assured that the BID would always be asked for whenever someone with the appearance of belonging to an ethnic minority walked in to apply for a job with an employer.</p>

The code is intended to enable employers to comply with race relations legislation. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s difficulty, but what we are trying to achieve is in employers&#146; and employees&#146; best interests. That will probably be understood more widely in the labour market. I think we should close on that point because there is not much point in opening it up for further debate. I am sure we can return to it at another stage.</p>

<a name="70705-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07070562000008"></a>The council held an exchange of views and reached agreement on a general approach on the European Institute of Technology (EIT). The council agreed that the number of knowledge and innovation communities (KICs) should be set at two or three to allow for flexibility and that the possibility of establishing KICs inter alia in renewable energy and climate change should be included in the preamble to the draft regulation establishing the EIT. On the budget, the council agreed a sum of &#8364;308.7 million for a six-year period beginning on 1 January 2008. The UK expressed its concerns over that figure.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07070562000009"></a>Council conclusions were adopted on a charter for the management of intellectual property rights and on the CREST report on co-ordination of the structural funds and the framework programme to support research and development.</p>

<a name="70705-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07070562000010"></a>Ministers then had a short exchange of views on the European research area (ERA) Green Paper following up on discussions at the W1/4rzburg ministerial informal and the May Competitiveness Council, focusing on strengthening research institutions, knowledge sharing and international co-operation. The council agreed that more effective knowledge transfer between universities, business and public research institutions was at the heart of improving Europe's capacity for innovation, and some argued that any Commission proposals following the Green Paper would need to be informed by effective evaluation of the sixth framework programme for research.</p>

<ul><a name="07070541000077"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What is their response to the statement by the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR) on 19 June that at least 230 civilian deaths have been caused by international and Afghan government forces since the start of 2007; which of the recommendations they accept; and what action they will take, unilaterally, through NATO and through liaison with Operation Enduring Freedom and Afghan military forces to ensure conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law and to protect civilian lives. [HL4520]</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_0"></a>
<a name="07070541000016"></a><b><a name="70705w0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070541000100"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> All civilian casualties are a source of profound regret. Any loss of innocent lives is a tragedy. The UK joins the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief in condemning the actions of armed insurgents causing civilian casualties. The Taliban is responsible for the vast majority of civilian casualties, deliberately launching attacks from civilian locations such as schools and using suicide bombs and improvised explosive devices. The Taliban is quick to exaggerate and exploit any deaths caused by international forces.</p>

<a name="70705w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="07070541000017"></a>International forces, including UK forces, seek at all times to avoid loss of civilian life. The targeting process, weapons selection, doctrine, training and rules of engagement are all in line with international humanitarian and human rights law and the law of armed conflict.</p>

<a name="70705w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="07070541000018"></a>The Afghan security forces operate alongside two international forces, the International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom. Co-ordination between these groups is therefore key and has been the subject of further work over recent weeks. We are satisfied that there are sensible, pragmatic command and control relationships between the forces and that these are reassessed regularly.</p>

<a name="70705w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="07070541000019"></a>All reports of civilian casualties are investigated promptly and thoroughly, in co-ordination with the Afghan authorities. Where the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan chooses to investigate an incident, it is entirely free to do so.</p>

However, the legislation permitting disclosure that is most relevant to such requests is Section 197 of the Finance Act 2003 in relation to requests by EU member states under Council Directive 77/799/EEC, as amended, and Section 173(4) of the Finance Act 2006 in relation to requests made under the terms of a bilateral tax arrangement.</p>
